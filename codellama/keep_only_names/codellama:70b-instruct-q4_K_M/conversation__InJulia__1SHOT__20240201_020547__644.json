The `filter` function is used to iterate through each element of an array, and it only keeps those elements for which the condition (that the first letter be equal to its uppercase version) evaluates as true.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Rabbit\"]\nkeep_only_names(words)  # Returns a Vector containing only \"Dog\" and \"Rabbit\".\n```\nNote that this function assumes that each word in the list is capitalized properly, i.e., if a word starts with a lowercase letter it will not be considered as a name.","status":200,"tokens":[0,219],"elapsed":11.690081517,"_type":"aimessage"}]
