[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"1. Use a for loop to iterate over each word in the provided list of words (`words`)\n2. Check if the first character of the current word is uppercase using `isuppercase()` function\n3. If it's not, use `splice!` to remove the current word from the array\n4. Return the updated list after iterating over all the words\n5. You can use a `push!(result, word)` statement to add each valid name to a new result array\n6. Use the `startswith()` function to check if the first letter is uppercase\n7. Use the `map` function and the `filter` function to iterate over the list of words and return only those that start with capital letters\n8. You can use a regular expression (`r\"^[A-Z]`) to match only words starting with an uppercase letter\n9. Use the `uppercasefirst()` function to convert the first character of each word to uppercase, then check if it matches the original word using `==`\n10. You can use a recursive approach where you remove the first element if its first character is lowercase and call the same function with the rest of the array. Then concatenate the results together.\n11. Use a combination of the functions mentioned above to achieve this task in a creative way.","status":200,"tokens":[0,286],"elapsed":15.474645634,"_type":"aimessage"}]
