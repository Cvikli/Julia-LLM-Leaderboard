In this case, we are filtering out all words that do not start with an uppercase letter.\n\nThis function assumes that each word in the provided list will have at least one character. If there is a possibility of empty strings or `nothing` values being passed to the function, you may want to add additional checks to handle those cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,198],"elapsed":10.579824379,"_type":"aimessage"}]
