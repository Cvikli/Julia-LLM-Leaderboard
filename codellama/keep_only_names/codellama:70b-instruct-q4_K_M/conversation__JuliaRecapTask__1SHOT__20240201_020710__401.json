[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"I apologize for the mistake earlier. Here is the correct code for the task:\n```\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    result = []\n    for word in words\n        if uppercase(word[1]) == word[1]\n            push!(result, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of words as input and iterates over each word. For each word, it checks if the first character is an uppercase letter by comparing it to the same character in lowercase using the `uppercase()` function. If they are equal, that means the first character is not an uppercase letter, so we ignore this word. If they are not equal, that means the first character is an uppercase letter, and we add this word to a result list. After iterating over all words, the function returns the resulting list of words that start with capital letters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,204],"elapsed":11.021336886,"_type":"aimessage"}]
