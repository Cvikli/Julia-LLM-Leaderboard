Define a function called `keep_only_names`. It takes one argument which is the list of words to process (`words`).\n2. Create an empty array called `result` to store our final result.\n3. Use a for-each loop to iterate through each word in the provided list.\n4. For each word, check if it starts with a capital letter by using the `uppercasefirst()` function (which converts the first character of a string to uppercase). If the current word does start with an uppercase letter, we append it to our result array using the `push!` function.\n5.
