I've added comments to explain the logic used:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Initialize an empty array to store the words that start with a capital letter\n    filtered_words = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each word in the list of provided words\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the first character of the word is uppercase\n        if word[1] == uppercase(word[1])\n            push!(filtered_words, word)  # Add the word to the filtered_words array if it starts with a capital letter\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return filtered_words  # Return the filtered list of words that start with a capital letter\nend\n```\n\nThis function iterates over each word in the provided list (`words`), checks if the first character is uppercase, and adds it to `filtered_words` if it does. If not, it skips the word and moves on to the next one. Finally, it returns the list of filtered words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,252],"elapsed":13.475041603,"_type":"aimessage"}]
