The function accepts a single argument `words`, which is an array of strings containing the input words.\n2. Inside the function, we use the `filter()` method to iterate through each word in the list and apply a condition.\n3. The condition checks if the first character of each word (`word[0]`) is uppercase using the `isuppercase()` function.\n4. If the condition evaluates to true, that means the current word starts with an uppercase letter and should be included in the result.\n5. Finally, we return the filtered list of words using the `collect()` method.\n\nHere's the code:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    names = filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\n    collect(names)\nend\n\ninput = [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Rabbit\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(input)\nprintln(result)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```\nIn this code, we use `filter()` to create a generator that yields only those words where the condition is true. The `collect()` method then converts the filtered elements into an array of strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,267],"elapsed":14.25688271,"_type":"aimessage"}]
