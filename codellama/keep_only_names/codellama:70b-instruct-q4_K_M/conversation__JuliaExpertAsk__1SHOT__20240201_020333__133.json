It then uses `filter` to iterate through each word, checking if the first character is equal to its capitalized version using `uppercase`. If so, it keeps that word; otherwise, it removes it from the list. The filtered list is returned by this function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,147],"elapsed":7.844614385,"_type":"aimessage"}]
