The `filter` function is used to iterate over the list of words and keep only those that meet the condition specified in the lambda function passed as the second argument. In this case, we use the `uppercasefirst` function to convert the word to uppercase and then compare it to itself to see if the first letter is a capital letter. If the condition is true, the word is kept in the new list.","status":200,"tokens":[0,169],"elapsed":2.237001587,"_type":"aimessage"}]
