The `first` function is used to extract the first character of each word in the list.\n\nAlternatively, you could also use a comprehension:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return [word for word in words if isuppercase(first(word))]\nend\n```\nThis uses a comprehension to create a new array containing only the elements of `words` that start with an uppercase letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,198],"elapsed":2.598335677,"_type":"aimessage"}]
