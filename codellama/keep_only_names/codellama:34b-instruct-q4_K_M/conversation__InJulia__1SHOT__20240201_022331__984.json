The `isuppercase` function is used to check if the first character of each word is an uppercase letter. If it is, then the word is kept in the resulting vector.\n\nYou can test this function by passing in a vector of strings as an argument, like this:\n```\njulia> keep_only_names([\"Hello\", \"World\", \"dog\"])\n2-element Vector{String}:\n \"Hello\"\n \"World\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,192],"elapsed":5.297578646,"_type":"aimessage"}]
