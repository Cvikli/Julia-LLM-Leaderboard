It does this by iterating over the input array using the `for` loop, and for each word it checks whether the first character is uppercase or not using the `isuppercase()` function. If the first character is not uppercase, the word is removed from the array using the `deleteat!()` function. Finally, the function returns the modified array.\n\nYou can test this function with the following code:\n```\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"dog\"]\nkeep_only_names(words)\n# Output: [\"Dog\", \"Bird\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,236],"elapsed":6.539111307,"_type":"aimessage"}]
