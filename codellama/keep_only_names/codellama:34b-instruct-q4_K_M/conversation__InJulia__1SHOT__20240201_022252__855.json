The `word[1]` expression is used to extract the first character of each word, and the `isupper()` method is called on that character to check if it is uppercase.\n\nYou can test this function by passing in a list of words:\n```\njulia> keep_only_names([\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\"])\n3-element Vector{String}:\n \"Dog\"\n \"Cat\"\n \"Cat\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,193],"elapsed":5.354279649,"_type":"aimessage"}]
