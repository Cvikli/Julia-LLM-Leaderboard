It uses the `occursin` function to check if each word starts with a capital letter, and the `deleteat!` function to remove any words that do not meet this criteria.\n\nHere's an example of how you could use this function:\n```\njulia> words = [\"apple\", \"Banana\", \"cat\", \"DOG\"];\n4-element Vector{String}:\n \"apple\"\n \"Banana\"\n \"cat\"\n \"DOG\"\n\njulia> keep_only_names(words)\n3-element Vector{String}:\n \"Banana\"\n \"DOG\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,250],"elapsed":6.966540549,"_type":"aimessage"}]
