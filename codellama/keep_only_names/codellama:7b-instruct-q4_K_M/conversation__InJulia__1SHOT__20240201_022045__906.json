If it does, it is added to the `filtered_words` list. The resulting list is returned at the end of the function.\n\nYou can call this function by passing in a list of words as arguments, like this:\n```\njulia> keep_only_names([\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\"])\n2-element Array{String,1}:\n \"Dog\"\n \"cat\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,196],"elapsed":1.604964864,"_type":"aimessage"}]
