[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the `keep_only_names` function:\n```scss\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(words, word -> isuppercase(word[1]))\nend\n```\nThis implementation uses the `filter` function to iterate over the list of words and remove any word that does not start with a capital letter. The `isuppercase` function is used to check if a character is uppercase or not.\n\nHere's an explanation of the code:\n\n* The `keep_only_names` function takes a single argument, which is the list of words to be filtered.\n* The function uses the `filter` function to iterate over the list of words and remove any word that does not start with a capital letter.\n* The `isuppercase` function is used to check if a character is uppercase or not. It returns true if the first character of the word is an uppercase letter, false otherwise.\n* The `filter` function takes two arguments: the list of words to be filtered and the predicate function that determines which elements should be removed. In this case, the predicate function is a lambda function that checks if the first character of each word is an uppercase letter. If it is not, the word is removed from the list.\n* The `end` keyword is used to indicate the end of the function definition.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that all words are in lowercase. If you want to handle words in uppercase as well, you can modify the predicate function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,334],"elapsed":2.914292004,"_type":"aimessage"}]
