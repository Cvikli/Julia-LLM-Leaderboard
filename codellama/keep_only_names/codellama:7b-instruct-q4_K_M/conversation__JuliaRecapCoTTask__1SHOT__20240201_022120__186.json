[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Let's break down the task into smaller steps:\n\n1. Iterate over the list of words and check if each word starts with a capital letter.\n2. If a word does not start with a capital letter, remove it from the list.\n3. Return the modified list of words.\n\nHere's an example implementation:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the filtered words\n    filtered_words = []\n\n    # Iterate over the input list and check if each word starts with a capital letter\n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(word[1])\n            push!(filtered_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\nIn this implementation, we first define an empty list `filtered_words` to store the filtered words. Then, we iterate over the input list `words` and check if each word starts with a capital letter using the `isuppercase()` function. If a word does not start with a capital letter, we do not add it to the `filtered_words` list. Finally, we return the `filtered_words` list.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that all words in the input list are strings. If some of the words are not strings, you may need to modify the implementation accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,300],"elapsed":2.507596943,"_type":"aimessage"}]
