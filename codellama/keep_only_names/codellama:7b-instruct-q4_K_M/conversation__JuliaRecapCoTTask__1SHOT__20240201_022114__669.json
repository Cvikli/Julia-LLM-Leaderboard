[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem, I will first recall the Julia syntax for defining functions and control structures. Then, I will write a function `keep_only_names` that takes a list of words as input (`words`) and iterates over the list using a `for` loop. For each word in the list, I will check if it starts with a capital letter using the `isupper` function from the `Base` module. If the word does not start with a capital letter, I will remove it from the list by using the `pop!` method to delete the word from the list. Finally, I will return the modified list of words.\n```julia\nusing Base: isupper\n\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    for i in 1:length(words)\n        if !isupper(words[i][1])\n            pop!(words, i)\n        end\n    end\n    return words\nend\n```\nTo test the function, I will create a list of words and pass it to the `keep_only_names` function. The output should be a list of names that start with a capital letter.\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"cat\", \"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Bird\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names) # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Bird\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,303],"elapsed":2.663865691,"_type":"aimessage"}]
