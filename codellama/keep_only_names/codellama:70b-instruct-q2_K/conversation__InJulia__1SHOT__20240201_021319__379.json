It iterates through each string and checks whether the first letter is uppercase using the `isuppercase` method. If it is, it adds that word to a new list called `names`. Finally, it returns this new list containing only names that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,145],"elapsed":5.867898674,"_type":"aimessage"}]
