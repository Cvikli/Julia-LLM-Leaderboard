It uses the built-in function `filter` to create a new array that keeps only the elements that start with uppercase letters. In Julia, strings can be indexed and accessed by their position, just like arrays or lists.\n* The `uppercase()` function is used to convert any letter to its uppercase form, regardless of whether it was originally uppercase or lowercase. This ensures that all words are treated in the same way.\n* Finally, the function returns an array with only words that start with capital letters.\n\nIn this case, `keep_only_names(words)` would return a list containing \"Apple\", \"Carrot\".\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or if I can assist in any other way! ðŸ˜Š","status":200,"tokens":[0,335],"elapsed":13.803800226,"_type":"aimessage"}]
