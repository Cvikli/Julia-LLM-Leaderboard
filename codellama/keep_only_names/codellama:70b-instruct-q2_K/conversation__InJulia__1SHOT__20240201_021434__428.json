The name of this function is `keep_only_names` as per your request. I'll use the function argument name `words`, assuming it contains a list of words to check.\n2.  Iterate through each word in the provided `words` list using a for loop, and assign each word to a variable named `word`.\n3.  Check if the first character (`char`) of the current `word` is uppercase using the built-in `isuppercase(char)` function. If it's not, continue to the next iteration without adding the word to the final list.\n4.  If the first letter is uppercase, append the word to a new list named `names`. This will keep only words starting with an uppercase letter.\n5.  Return the list of names at the end of the function.\n\n```julia-repl\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Initialize an empty list to store names (words that start with a capital letter).\n    names = String[]\n    \n    for word in words  # Iterate over each word in the provided list of words.\n        if isuppercase(word[1])  # Check if the first character of the word is uppercase.\n            push!(names, word)  # Append the current word to the names list.\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return names  # Return the final list of words that start with a capital letter (names).\nend\n```\n\nNow, you can call this function by passing a list of words as an argument:\n\n```julia-repl\n# Sample input list.\nwords = [\"Hello\", \"dog\", \"Julia\", \"cat\"]\n\n# Call the keep_only_names function and store the output in a variable called names.\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\n\n# Print the result to see only words starting with an uppercase letter.\nprintln(names)  # Output: [\"Hello\", \"Julia\"]\n```\n\nThis code iterates over each word in the provided list, checks if the first character is uppercase, and keeps only those words that start with a capital letter. The final result is stored in the `names` variable.","status":200,"tokens":[0,490],"elapsed":20.03978936,"_type":"aimessage"}]
