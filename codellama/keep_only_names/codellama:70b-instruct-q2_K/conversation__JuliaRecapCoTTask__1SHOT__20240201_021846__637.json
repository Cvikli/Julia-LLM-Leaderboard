[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"1. **Code Snippets**: You may want to refer to the following code snippets that might be useful in solving this task. Please note that they are not required, but can provide some guidance on how to approach the problem.\n\n\t```julia\n\tfunction keep_only_names(words)\n        # Your code here\n    end\n\t```\n2. **Function Declaration**: You will need to declare a function called `keep_only_names`, which takes in a list of words (`words`) as input and returns the filtered list as output.\n3. **Iteration over Words**: You can use a for loop or map() function to iterate over each word in the list. For each word, you will need to check if it starts with an uppercase letter (using `isuppercase`).\n4. **Removal of Non-Capitalized Words**: If a word does not start with a capital letter, you can remove it from the filtered list by using a filter() function or an if statement.\n5. **Return Filtered List**: After removing all non-capitalized words, return the new, filtered list as output.\n\nTips:\n* Make sure to use the `isuppercase` function to check for capital letters at the beginning of each word.\n* If you're not familiar with filter() or map(), you can also use a standard for loop with an if statement inside to iterate over each word and remove non-capitalized words.\n\n# Example Usage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Mouse\"]\nnew_list = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(new_list)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Mouse\"]\n```\n\nIf you have any questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š","status":200,"tokens":[0,406],"elapsed":16.88237721,"_type":"aimessage"}]
