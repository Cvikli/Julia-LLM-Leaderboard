It will iterate over all of the `words` and remove any that do not start with a capital letter. Note that it is important to use `filter!` rather than `deleteat!`, since you are deleting elements based on their value, not their index in the array.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if I can clarify anything or make changes as necessary.","status":200,"tokens":[0,145],"elapsed":5.903469561,"_type":"aimessage"}]
