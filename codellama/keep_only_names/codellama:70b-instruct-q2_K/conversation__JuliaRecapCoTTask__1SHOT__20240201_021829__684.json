[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"This task is to write a function `keep_only_names` that takes a list of words and filters out all the words starting with a capital letter. I will provide an example input/output for clarification:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"fish\", \"Bird\"]  # Input List\nfiltered_list = keep_only_names(words)  # Function call\nprint(filtered_list)  # Output List\n>>> [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Bird\"]\n```\nI will be providing specific instructions on how to solve the task, including what built-in functions or techniques you should use. These instructions are tailored to the Julia language and may not apply to other programming languages. Please follow them carefully to ensure a correct solution:\n\n**Step 1: Define a Function `keep_only_names`**\nCreate a function named `keep_only_names` that takes a list of words as input. You can use the syntax `function keep_only_names(words) ... end` for this.\n```julia\n# Define the function\nfunction keep_only_names(words)  # Function definition\n    # TODO: Complete the function body\nend\n```\n**Step 2: Create a Filter Condition**\nWrite an if-else statement that checks each word in the list and only returns words starting with a capital letter. You can use the `==` operator to check for equality, or you can use the built-in `startswith()` function.\n```julia\n# Check for capitalized words\nif startswith(word, uppercase(first(word)))  # If word starts with an uppercase letter\n    # TODO: Return this word\nelse\n    # Discard non-capitalized words\nend\n```\n**Step 3: Iterate Over the List and Apply the Filter**\nUse a loop to iterate over each word in the input list. You can use `for` or `while` loops for this, as well as any other looping structures provided by Julia's standard libraries.\n```julia\n# Iterate over words\nfor word in words  # Loop over every element in 'words'\n    if startswith(word, uppercase(first(word)))  # Check for capitalized words\n        filtered_list = append!(filtered_list, word)  # Append matching words to a new list\n    end\nend\n```\n**Step 4: Return the Filtered List**\nReturn the filtered list of words that start with a capital letter. You can use `return` or simply print the resulting list for debugging purposes.\n```julia\n# Print result or return value\nprintln(filtered_list)  # Print the filtered list to console\n```\nThe final code should look like this:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filtered_list = []  # Create an empty list for filtered words\n    \n    for word in words  # Iterate over every element in 'words'\n        if startswith(word, uppercase(first(word)))  # Check for capitalized words\n            filtered_list = append!(filtered_list, word)  # Append matching words to a new list\n        end\n    end\n    \n    println(filtered_list)  # Print the filtered list to console\nend\n```\nThis solution uses a function and loops to iterate over the input list and filter out non-capitalized words. It then returns or prints the resulting list of capitalized words.
