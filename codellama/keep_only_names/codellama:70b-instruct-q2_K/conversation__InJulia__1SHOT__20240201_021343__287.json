Define a function called `keep_only_names` that takes in a single parameter `words`. Initialize an empty array `result` to store the filtered words.\n2. Iterate through each word in the list using a for loop.\n3. For each word, check if the first character is equal to its uppercase version (which will be true if it's an uppercase letter).

If the condition evaluates to `true`, append the current word to the `result` array using the `push!()` method.\n5. After iterating through all words, return the `result` array containing only names (words starting with an uppercase letter).\n\nHere's a complete code snippet:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    result = [] # Initialize empty list to store filtered words\n    \n    for word in words \n        if first(word) == uppercase(first(word)) # Check if the first letter is uppercase\n            push!(result, word)  # Append the current word to the result array\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return result # Return the filtered list of names (words starting with an uppercase letter)\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, we define a function called `keep_only_names` that takes a single parameter `words`, which is assumed to be a list containing words. We initialize an empty array `result` to store the filtered words. Inside the for loop, we check if each word starts with an uppercase letter using the condition:\n```julia\nfirst(word) == uppercase(first(word))  # Checks whether the first character is uppercase or not\n```\nIf the condition evaluates to `true`, we append the current word to the result array using `push!(result, word)`. After iterating through all words, we return the filtered list of names (words starting with an uppercase letter) as the function's output.","status":200,"tokens":[0,445],"elapsed":18.115337891,"_type":"aimessage"}]
