The `keep_only_names` function takes a single argument: `words`, which is the list of strings to process.\n2. Using the `map()` function, iterate over each word in `words`. For each word, check if it starts with an uppercase letter using the `isuppercase` function. If the first character of the word is not an uppercase letter, replace the current word with `\"\"`. (This will remove that word from the list.)\n3. Finally, use `filter(!=(\"\"), words)` to remove all empty strings (`\"\"`) from the list, leaving only those words that started with a capital letter.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(!=(\"\"), map(word -> isuppercase(first(word)) ? word : \"\", words))\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"horse\"]\nkeep_only_names(words)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```\n\nThis code uses the built-in `map` function, which applies a provided function to each element of an iterable collection. In this case, the function checks if each word begins with an uppercase letter using `isuppercase`. If not, it replaces that word with an empty string `\"\"`, effectively removing it from the list. The final line filters out all empty strings, leaving only those words that started with a capital letter in the resulting list.","status":200,"tokens":[0,323],"elapsed":13.119904121,"_type":"aimessage"}]
