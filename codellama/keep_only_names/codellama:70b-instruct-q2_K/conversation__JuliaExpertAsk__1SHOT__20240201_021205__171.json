This function assumes that each word is separated by spaces. It also returns a string rather than modifying the input list.\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::String)\n    words_array = split(words, \" \")  # Split the words into an array of individual words\n\n    capitalized_words = [word for word in words_array if word[1] == uppercase(word[1])]  # Create a new list containing only those words that start with a capital letter\n\n    return join(capitalized_words, \" \")  # Join the remaining words into a string and return it\nend\n```\nIn this function, we first split the input string into an array of individual words. We then iterate over each word in the array, checking if its first character is equal to its capitalized form (which will be true for any uppercase letter). If so, the word is added to a new list containing only those words that start with capital letters. Finally, we join all the remaining words back into a string and return it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,245],"elapsed":10.079721055,"_type":"aimessage"}]
