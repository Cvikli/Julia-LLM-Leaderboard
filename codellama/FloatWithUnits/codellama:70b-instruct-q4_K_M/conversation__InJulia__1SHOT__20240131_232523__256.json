This method takes an input stream (`io`) and an instance of `FloatWithUnits` (`fwu`) as arguments. It uses the `print` function to print the concatenated value and unit with a space between them.\n\nTo create an instance of `FloatWithUnits`, you can use:\n```julia\n# Create an instance of FloatWithUnits struct\nmeter = FloatWithUnits(10, \"meters\")  # value=10, unit=\"meters\"\n```\nYou can then show the created instance using the `show` method. It will display the concatenated value and unit with a space between them:\n```julia\n# Show an instance of FloatWithUnits struct\nshow(meter)  # Outputs: \"10 meters\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,398],"elapsed":21.315492068,"_type":"aimessage"}]
