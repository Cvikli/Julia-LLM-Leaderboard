The `::MIME\"text/plain\"` parameter allows us to specify what kind of data type we want to display (in this case, plain text). \n\nIn short, this code defines a struct called `FloatWithUnits` that takes in two fields: value (a floating-point number) and unit (a string representing the units of measurement). The `show()` function is then defined so that when we print an object of type `FloatWithUnits`, it will concatenate its value and units with a space.","status":200,"tokens":[0,235],"elapsed":12.592361179,"_type":"aimessage"}]
