It has two fields: `value` and `unit`, with types `Float64` and `String` respectively. The `show` method is defined as an extension of Julia's built-in `Base.show` method for this struct type, allowing us to customize its behavior when printing instances of the `FloatWithUnits` struct. This function takes in two arguments: `io`, which represents the input/output stream on which we will write, and `fwu`, an instance of the `FloatWithUnits` struct. Inside the function body, we use string interpolation to concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields with a space between them. Finally, we call `println` on `io` with this interpolated string as the argument. ✨","status":200,"tokens":[0,261],"elapsed":13.967120418,"_type":"aimessage"}]
