The `show` method is used to display a customized string representation of an object in Julia. We'll use the `string()` function to concatenate the value and unit with a space between them.\n\nHere's how you can write a `show` method:\n\n```julia\nBase.show(io::IO, ::MIME\"text/plain\", fwu::FloatWithUnits) = print(io, string(fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit))\n```\n\nThis will display the `FloatWithUnits` struct in a customized format with a space between the value and unit when using the `show()` method:\n\n```julia\n# Create an instance of FloatWithUnits\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n\n# Display it using show()\nshow(stdout, fwu)  # Output: \"1.8 meters\"\n```\n\nNote that the `Base` module is used to extend existing Julia functionality like `show()`. The `::MIME\"text/plain\"` part ensures that this method will only be called when displaying objects in text mode (e.g., using REPL).","status":200,"tokens":[0,346],"elapsed":18.550951671,"_type":"aimessage"}]
