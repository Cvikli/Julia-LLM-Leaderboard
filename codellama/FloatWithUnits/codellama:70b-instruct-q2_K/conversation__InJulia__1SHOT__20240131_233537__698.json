We also define a custom method for showing this struct by overriding `Base.show`. Inside our new `show` method, we print the value and unit to an IO object (represented as `io`) with a space between them using the `string` function.\n\nOnce you run this code in the Julia REPL, you can create instances of `FloatWithUnits` like this:\n```julia-repl\njulia> x = FloatWithUnits(3.14, \"meters\")\n3.14 meters\n```\n\nIf you want to display a unit that contains spaces (e.g., `square feet`), you can enclose the unit in double quotes:\n\n```julia-repl\njulia> y = FloatWithUnits(100.2, \"square feet\")\n100.2 square feet\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,296],"elapsed":12.120341047,"_type":"aimessage"}]
