First, let's create the struct `FloatWithUnits`:\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n```\n2. Then, we can define a method for it with the help of the macro `@show` that will show all fields in this structure:\n```julia\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, ::MIME\"text/plain\", x::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"value: \")\n    show(io, x.value) # call the default show method for Float64\n    println(io) # add a newline\n    print(io, \"unit: \")\n    show(io, x.unit) # call the default show method for String\nend\n```\n3. Now we can try to use our struct and see how it looks in different environments:\n```julia\njulia> julia1 = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nvalue: 1.8000000000000000\nunit: meters\nFloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n\njulia> julia2 = FloatWithUnits(5.3498, \"kilometers\")\nvalue: 5.3497999999999995\nunit: kilometers\nFloatWithUnits(5.3498, \"kilometers\")\n```\n\nThis should be the basic usage of how to display a struct in Julia!
