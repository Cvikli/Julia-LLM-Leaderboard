The fields can be accessed through the dot syntax (e.g., `my_struct.field`).\n\nTo define a `show` method for your `FloatWithUnits` struct, you need to create a custom function that accepts an instance of the struct as input and returns its representation as a string. This is done using the `show(io::IO, x)` function signature, where `x` represents your struct.\n\nHere's how it would look in Julia:\n\n```julia-repl\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction show(io::IO, x::FloatWithUnits)\n    return string(x.value, \" \", x.unit)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\njulia> my_struct = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nFloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n\njulia> show(stdout, my_struct)\n\"1.8 meters\"  # This is the output from the show method\n```\n\nThis code defines a `show` method that returns a string representation of your struct by concatenating its fields with a space in between. The `string()` function converts each value to a string before concatenating them.\n\nRemember, Julia's convention is to use camel case when naming structs (e.g., FloatWithUnits). Also, make sure to define the struct and all its fields correctly, as this can affect the output of your code.\n\nI hope this helps you with your task!
