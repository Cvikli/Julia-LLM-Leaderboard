The method simply concatenates the value and unit with a space using the `$()` operator, then prints the result to the `io` stream.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the `unit` field is always a string, which may not be the case in practice. If you need to handle other types of units, you will need to modify the implementation accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,198],"elapsed":1.674182398,"_type":"aimessage"}]
