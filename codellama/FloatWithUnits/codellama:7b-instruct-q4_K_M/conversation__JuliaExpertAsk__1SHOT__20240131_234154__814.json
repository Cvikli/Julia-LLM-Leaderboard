This allows us to define a custom `show` method for the struct without having to manually write out the entire implementation. The `@show` macro takes two arguments: the first is the name of the struct, and the second is the name of the function that will be called when the `show` method is invoked. In this case, the function is `show`.\n\nThe `show` method itself is defined using the `print` function from the `Base` module. This function takes two arguments: the first is the IO stream to which the output should be written, and the second is the string that should be printed to the stream. In this case, we're printing the value of the `FloatWithUnits` struct followed by a space and then the unit.\n\nTo use this method, you can simply create an instance of the `FloatWithUnits` struct with your desired values for the `value` and `unit` fields, and then call the `show` method on it:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nshow(fwu) # Output: 1.8 meters\n```\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.","status":200,"tokens":[0,383],"elapsed":3.359070463,"_type":"aimessage"}]
