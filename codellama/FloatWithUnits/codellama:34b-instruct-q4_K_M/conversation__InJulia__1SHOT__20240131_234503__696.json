The method takes an input/output (IO) object and a `FloatWithUnits` instance as arguments, and prints the value and unit of the instance to the IO object separated by a space.\n\nHere's an example of how you could use this struct and its `show` method:\n```\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nFloatWithUnits(1.8 meters)\n\njulia> println(fwu)\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,239],"elapsed":6.612846645,"_type":"aimessage"}]
