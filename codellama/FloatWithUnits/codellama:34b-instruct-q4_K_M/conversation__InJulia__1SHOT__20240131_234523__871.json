We then define a method for the `show` function that takes an `IO` object and a `FloatWithUnits` instance as arguments. The method prints the value and unit to the `IO` object, separated by a space.\n\nHere's an example of how you could use this struct:\n```julia\njulia> x = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n\njulia> show(stdout, x)\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,222],"elapsed":6.139230475,"_type":"aimessage"}]
