The show method is defined as a function that takes an `IO` object and a `FloatWithUnits` object as input, and prints the value followed by a space and the unit to the IO object.\n\nYou can test this by creating a new instance of `FloatWithUnits`, like this:\n```\njulia> x = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[75,206],"elapsed":5.883799152,"_type":"aimessage"}]
