The `show` method is then defined for this struct to print the value and unit separated by a space.\n\nNote that the `print` function is used instead of `println` because we don't want to insert a newline character at the end of the output.","status":200,"tokens":[0,200],"elapsed":5.541347041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
