Here is an example of how you could do this:\n```\n@show FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\") # Output: 1.8 meters\n```\nAlternatively, you can define the `show` method for this struct manually using the `function` keyword. Here is an example of how you could do this:\n```\nfunction show(io::IO, x::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, string(x.value), \" \", x.unit)\nend\n```\nThis will define a method for the `show` function that takes two arguments: an I/O stream (`io`) and a `FloatWithUnits` object (`x`). It will then print the value of the `value` field followed by a space, followed by the value of the `unit` field.\n\nYou can then use this method to show the value of a `FloatWithUnits` object like this:\n```\njulia> x = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,308],"elapsed":8.540321753,"_type":"aimessage"}]
