[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

It then sorts the events by start time using the `sort!` function from the `Base` module. The `by=` parameter specifies that we want to sort based on the start time of each event, which is stored in the first element of each tuple.\n\nNext, the function iterates over the sorted events and checks for conflicts by comparing the finish times of each event with the start time of the next event. If the finish time of an event is greater than the start time of the next event, it means that the two events overlap in time and there is a conflict. The `Dates.datetime2epochms` function is used to convert the datetime values to milliseconds since the epoch, which allows us to compare them directly.\n\nIf no conflicts are found, the function returns \"No conflicts\". If any conflicts are found, it returns \"Conflict\" immediately.","status":200,"tokens":[0,422],"elapsed":3.66217492,"_type":"aimessage"}]
