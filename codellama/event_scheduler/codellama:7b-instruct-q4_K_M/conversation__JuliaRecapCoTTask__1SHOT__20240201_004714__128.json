Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n\t* Use the `Dates` package to parse dates and times in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'.\n\t* Use the `intersect` function from the `Base` module to check for overlapping time intervals.\n2. Solve the Task:\n\t* Define a function `event_scheduler(events)` that takes a list of events as input and returns \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events, or \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time.\n\t* Use the `Dates` package to parse each event's start and finish times into `DateTime` objects.\n\t* Use the `intersect` function from the `Base` module to check for overlapping time intervals between adjacent pairs of events. If any overlapping intervals are found, return \"Conflict\".\n\t* If no overlapping intervals are found, continue to the next pair of events and repeat the same check until all pairs have been checked.\n\t* If all pairs have been checked without finding any overlapping intervals, return \"No conflicts\".\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\t* Test the function with a small set of inputs (e.g., 2 or 3 events) to ensure that it works correctly.\n\t* Test the function with a larger set of randomized inputs to ensure that it handles edge cases and corner cases correctly.\n\t* Use the `Dates` package's `isless` function to check whether one event starts before another event ends, and use this information to determine which event should be scheduled first if they overlap.","status":200,"tokens":[0,404],"elapsed":3.478846702,"_type":"aimessage"}]
