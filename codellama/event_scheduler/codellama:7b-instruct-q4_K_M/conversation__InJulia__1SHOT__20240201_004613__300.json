[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

If it is, it returns \"No events\".\n* Otherwise, it maps each event to its start and finish times using the `map` function with a lambda function that extracts the start and finish times from each tuple.\n* It then iterates over the start times in the list, comparing each pair of adjacent start times to see if they overlap. If two events have an overlap, it returns \"Conflict\".\n* Finally, if no overlaps are found, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,265],"elapsed":2.302594955,"_type":"aimessage"}]
