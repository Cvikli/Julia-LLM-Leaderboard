The function parses the dates, sorts them in ascending order, and checks for any overlapping intervals between events. If there are no conflicts, it returns \"No conflicts\". Otherwise, it returns \"Conflict\". If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,387],"elapsed":15.960097969,"_type":"aimessage"}]
