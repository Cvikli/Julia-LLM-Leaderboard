I then define a function `parse_time` that takes a string and returns a DateTime object using a format string. This function is not directly called in the main part of the code but may be useful if you need to modify it for your specific needs.\n\nThe `event_scheduler` function takes a list of tuples, where each tuple represents an event with a start time and finish time. The function first checks whether the input list is empty and returns \"No events\" in that case. If not, I sort the events by their starting times using a built-in Julia function `sort`. This ensures that we're iterating through the events in the correct order.\n\nThe main part of the code iterates through each event, comparing its end time to all subsequent events' start times. If any of these comparisons yields \"true\" (meaning there is an overlap), I return \"Conflict\". Otherwise, if we finish iterating without finding a conflict, I return \"No conflicts.\"","status":200,"tokens":[0,936],"elapsed":39.232986991,"_type":"aimessage"}]
