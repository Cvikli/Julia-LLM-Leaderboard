Otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\" for non-overlapping events or \"No events\" if the list is empty.\n\nThe code uses the `sort` function to sort the events by their start times using a custom sorting criterion (`by=(e -> e[1])`). This ensures that the adjacent pairs of events in the sorted list are consecutive and can be compared for conflicts efficiently.","status":200,"tokens":[0,537],"elapsed":22.213153011,"_type":"aimessage"}]
