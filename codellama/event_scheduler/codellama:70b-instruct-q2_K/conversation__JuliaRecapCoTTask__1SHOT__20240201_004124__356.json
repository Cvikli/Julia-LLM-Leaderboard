[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

This function takes in an array of tuples, which are parsed by Dates package to create DateFormat objects. The dates are sorted using `sort` function with a custom sorting function that compares end times if start times are equal. The function then iterates over the sorted events to check for any conflicts (start time of next event being less than or equal to previous event's finish time). If no conflicts are found, it returns \"No conflicts\" else \"Conflict\".\n\n```julia\nusing Dates # Important package for date parsing and manipulation üìÖÔ∏è\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector)\n    isempty(events) && return \"No events\"\n    df = DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n    sorted_events = sort([Dates.parse.(event, df) for event in events]) do a, b  # Sorting with custom comparator function for overlaps üí°Ô∏è\n        a[2] == b[2] ? a[1] < b[1] : a[2] < b[2] \n    end\n    for i = 1:length(sorted_events) - 1\n        if sorted_events[i + 1][1] <= sorted_events[i][2]  # Checking for overlaps üîçÔ∏è\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes in a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').
