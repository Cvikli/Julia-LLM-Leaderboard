It sorts the list by start times using the built-in sort! function. Then it iterates through the sorted list, comparing each event's end time with the next event's start time to check for conflicts. If any overlap is found, it returns \"Conflict\". If no overlaps are found, it returns \"No conflicts\". If the list of events is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,317],"elapsed":13.11144434,"_type":"aimessage"}]
