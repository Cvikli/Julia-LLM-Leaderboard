Then it iterates through each event in the list, comparing their start and finish times with those of other events. If there is an overlap, the conflicting events are added to a conflicts array. The function returns \"No conflicts\" if no overlapping events are found or an array of conflicting events otherwise.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the input list contains valid date-time strings in the specified format. It does not perform any error checking for invalid inputs.","status":200,"tokens":[0,459],"elapsed":18.972999957,"_type":"aimessage"}]
