Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

If there are no overlapping events, it should return \"No conflicts\". If any events overlap in time, it should return \"Conflict\". If the list is empty, it should return \"No events\".\n\nHere's how you can solve this task:\n\n```julia\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    # Sort events by start time\n    sorted_events = sort(events; by=first)\n    \n    current_end = sorted_events[1][2]\n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if current_end > sorted_events[i][1]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n        \n        current_end = sorted_events[i][2]\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nIn this code, the `event_scheduler` function takes a list of event tuples as input. It first checks whether the list is empty and returns \"No events\" if it is. If there are events in the list, it sorts them by start time using the `sort` function, with the `by=first` keyword argument to indicate that the sort should be based on the first element of each tuple (i.e., the start times). It then iterates through the sorted events and checks whether any event starts before the previous one ends. If it finds an overlap, it returns \"Conflict\". If there are no overlaps, it returns \"No conflicts\" at the end of the loop.","status":200,"tokens":[0,386],"elapsed":16.128664259,"_type":"aimessage"}]
