The function will return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".\n\nHere's how you can write this code using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction event_scheduler(event_list)\n    # Create an array to store events that have been checked for conflicts\n    checked = [] \n    \n    function check_conflict(start, finish)\n        for (checked_start, checked_finish) in checked\n            if start < checked_finish && finish > checked_start\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n        push!(checked, (start, finish))  # Add the event to the checked array\n        return false \n    end\n    \n    for (event_start, event_end) in event_list\n        if isa(event_start, String) && isa(event_end, String)\n            start = Dates.Date(event_start)\n            finish = Dates.Date(event_end)\n            result = check_conflict(start, finish)\n            # If a conflict is found, return \"Conflict\" and break out of the loop\n            if result == \"Conflict\"\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        else\n            # If event times are not strings or not in date format, return error message\n            return \"Error: Invalid Date Format\"\n        end\n    end\n    return \"No conflicts\"  // Return No Conflicts if no overlapping events were found.\nend\n```\n\nThe `event_scheduler` function takes a list of events as input, each event represented as a tuple with the start and finish times. It uses the `Dates` package to parse the date strings into Date objects. The function iterates through each event, checking for conflicts by comparing the start and end times against previously checked events in the `checked` array. If any overlap is found, \"Conflict\" is returned. If no conflicts are found, \"No conflicts\" is returned. If the list of events is empty, \"No events\" is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,509],"elapsed":21.193504863,"_type":"aimessage"}]
