The `by` keyword argument allows you to specify the sorting criterion. \n\nThe `for` loop iterates through all events after the first one and compares their start times with the finish time of the previous event (`last`). If an overlap is found, it returns `\"Conflict\"`. Otherwise, it returns `\"No conflicts\"` after iterating over all events.","status":200,"tokens":[0,432],"elapsed":18.087840123,"_type":"aimessage"}]
