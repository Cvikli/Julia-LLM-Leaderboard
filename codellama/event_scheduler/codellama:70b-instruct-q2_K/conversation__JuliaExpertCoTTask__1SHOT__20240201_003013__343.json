Use package Dates for parsing.\n\nThe data you provided was a string representation of an array that contains two tuples with start and end times. These timestamps are not valid dates because they do not have a time zone component. Additionally, the format does not match the format in which Julia represents dates and times.\n\nTo handle this situation, I suggest rewriting your task to use valid dates and times that have a defined time zone. You can also consider using a specific date format or parsing package for handling these types of inputs. Here's an example:\n\n# Task\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').
