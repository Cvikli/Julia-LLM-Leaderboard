[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

If not, it loops over all pairs of events (except for the last event with itself) and checks whether there is a scheduling conflict between them. If any pair of events overlap in time, the function returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,262],"elapsed":3.661953422,"_type":"aimessage"}]
