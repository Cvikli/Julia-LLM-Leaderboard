Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If an overlap is found, it returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\". The use of `isempty` and `sort!` ensures that the function will handle empty lists and sort the events correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,237],"elapsed":3.234465839,"_type":"aimessage"}]
