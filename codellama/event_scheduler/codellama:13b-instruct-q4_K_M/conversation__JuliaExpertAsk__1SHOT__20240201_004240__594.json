Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{DateTime, DateTime}})::String\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    for (i, ev1) in enumerate(events)\n        for (j, ev2) in enumerate(events[i+1:end])\n            if isoverlapping(ev1, ev2)\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\nfunction isoverlapping(ev1::Tuple{DateTime, DateTime}, ev2::Tuple{DateTime, DateTime})::Bool\n    return (ev1[1] <= ev2[2]) && (ev2[1] <= ev1[2])\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list is empty.
