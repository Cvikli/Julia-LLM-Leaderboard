Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Otherwise, it iterates over all pairs of consecutive events using `eachindex` to check for overlapping time ranges. If any two events overlap in time, the function returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[153,178],"elapsed":2.450015812,"_type":"aimessage"}]
