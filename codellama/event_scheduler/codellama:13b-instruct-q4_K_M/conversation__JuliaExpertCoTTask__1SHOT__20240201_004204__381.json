First, I import the `Dates` package for parsing dates and times.\n\nNext, I define a function called `event_scheduler`. This function takes in a list of events, where each event is represented as a tuple with two strings representing the start and finish time, respectively.\n\nInside the function, I first check if the length of the input list is zero. If it is, then there are no events to schedule, so I return \"No events\".\n\nOtherwise, I loop through each event in the list using a for loop. For each event, I extract the start and finish time using `Date()` function from Dates package.\n\nThen, I check if there is any scheduling conflict between the current event and the rest of the events in the list. If there is a conflict, then I return \"Conflict\". Otherwise, I continue checking for conflicts until I reach the end of the list.\n\nIf no conflicts are found, then I return \"No conflicts\".\n\nThis approach solves the problem by checking for any scheduling conflicts among the events and returning the appropriate string based on the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,405],"elapsed":5.63279039,"_type":"aimessage"}]
