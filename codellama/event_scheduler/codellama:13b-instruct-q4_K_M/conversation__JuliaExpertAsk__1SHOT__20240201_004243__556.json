Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If it's empty, it returns \"No events\". Otherwise, it finds the minimum and maximum start and finish times across all events using `minimum` and `maximum` functions from `Base` module. It then loops through each event pair and compares their end time with the next event's start time. If any of these pairs overlap in time, the function returns \"Conflict\". Finally, it returns \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events.","status":200,"tokens":[0,241],"elapsed":3.285704818,"_type":"aimessage"}]
