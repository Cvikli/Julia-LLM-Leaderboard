It uses the `Dates` package to parse the date and time strings into `DateTime` objects, which are then compared to determine whether there are any overlapping events. If no overlapping events are found, it returns \"No conflicts\", otherwise it returns \"Conflict\". If the input list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,219],"elapsed":2.985295668,"_type":"aimessage"}]
