It then loops through all pairs of events to check if there are any overlapping times. If an overlap is found, it returns \"Conflict\", otherwise it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nFor example, if we call `event_scheduler([(Date(\"2022-01-01\"), Date(\"2022-01-03\")), (Date(\"2022-01-05\"), Date(\"2022-01-06\"))])`, the function would return \"No conflicts\" because there are no overlapping events.\n\nIf we call `event_scheduler([(Date(\"2022-01-01\"), Date(\"2022-01-03\")), (Date(\"2022-01-04\"), Date(\"2022-01-06\"))])`, the function would return \"Conflict\" because the two events overlap in time.","status":200,"tokens":[0,444],"elapsed":6.09673473,"_type":"aimessage"}]
