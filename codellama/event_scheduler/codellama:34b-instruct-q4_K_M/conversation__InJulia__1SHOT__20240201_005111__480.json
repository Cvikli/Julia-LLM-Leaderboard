[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

The function checks if any events overlap in time by comparing the end time of one event with the start time of another event. If there are no overlapping events, the function returns \"No conflicts\". If there is at least one overlapping event, the function returns \"Conflict\".\n\nYou can test this function by passing a list of events to it, like this:\n```\nevents = [(\"2023-01-01 10:00\", \"2023-01-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-01-01 12:00\", \"2023-01-01 13:00\")]\nevent_scheduler(events) # returns \"No conflicts\"\n```\nYou can also test it with a list of overlapping events like this:\n```\nevents = [(\"2023-01-01 10:00\", \"2023-01-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-01-01 10:30\", \"2023-01-01 11:30\")]\nevent_scheduler(events) # returns \"Conflict\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,441],"elapsed":12.454988487,"_type":"aimessage"}]
