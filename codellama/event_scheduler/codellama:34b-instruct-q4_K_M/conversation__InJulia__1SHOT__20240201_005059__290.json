[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

This variable will be set to `true` if any overlapping events are found.\n* The function then iterates over all possible pairs of events and checks for overlapping times using the `>` and `<=` operators. If any pair of events overlap, `conflicts` is set to `true`.\n* Finally, the function returns \"Conflict\" if `conflicts` is `true`, or \"No conflicts\" otherwise.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the start and finish times are in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'. If your input data uses a different format, you'll need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[124,397],"elapsed":11.389641755,"_type":"aimessage"}]
