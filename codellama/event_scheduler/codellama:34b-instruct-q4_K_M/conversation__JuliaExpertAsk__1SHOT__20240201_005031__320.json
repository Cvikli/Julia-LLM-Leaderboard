Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{Date, Date}})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    for i in 1:length(events) - 1\n        start_time = events[i][1]\n        finish_time = events[i + 1][2]\n\n        if start_time <= finish_time\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nHere's an explanation of the code:\n\n1. The function takes a vector of tuples, where each tuple contains two dates representing the start and finish times of an event.\n2. If the list is empty, we return \"No events\".\n3. We loop through the list of events and check if there are any overlapping events. We do this by comparing the start time of each event with the finish time of the next event in the list. If the start time is less than or equal to the finish time, then we know that there is a conflict.\n4. If there is a conflict, we return \"Conflict\". Otherwise, if all events are non-overlapping, we return \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,288],"elapsed":8.132762636,"_type":"aimessage"}]
