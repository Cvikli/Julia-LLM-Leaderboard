[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

The function first checks if there are no events in the list. If so, it returns \"No events\". Otherwise, it sorts the events by start time using the `sort!` function from the `Dates` package.\n\nNext, the function iterates over each event and checks for conflicts with the next event in the list. It does this by comparing the finish time of an event with the start time of the next event. If any event has a finish time that is greater than the start time of the next event, then there is a conflict and the function returns \"Conflict\".\n\nIf the function reaches the end of the list without finding any conflicts, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,315],"elapsed":8.867086329,"_type":"aimessage"}]
