The function `event_scheduler` takes this list as input and checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.\n\nFirst, we sort the events using the `sort` function and specify that they should be sorted by their start times (`by=x->x[1]`). This ensures that we can easily check if any event overlaps with another one.\n\nThen, I initialize a variable called `prevEnd` to store the end time of the previous event. For each event in our sorted list, we check whether its start time is less than or equal to the `prevEnd`. If it is, there is an overlap between events, and we return \"Conflict\". Otherwise, if the start time is greater than `prevEnd`, there is no conflict, and we update the `prevEnd` variable to be the end time of the current event.\n\nAfter checking all events in this way, if none of them overlapped, it means that there were no conflicts in scheduling, so we return \"No conflicts\". If the list of events is empty, the function will not enter the `for` loop and immediately return \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[132,384],"elapsed":20.92213011,"_type":"aimessage"}]
