Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n1.  Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n    - Packages `Dates`, `TimeZones` for date and time manipulation.\n    - Tuples `(; start_time=\"2021-05-31 14:00\", finish_time=\"2021-06-07 18:00\")` for event representation.\n    - Functions `event_scheduler(events) = ...` for scheduling conflicts check.\n    - For loop, while loops for iterating through events list.\n    - Conditionals `if-else`, `isX ? X : Y` for conflict checks.\n2.  Solve the Task:\n    1. Define function `event_scheduler(events)` to process event conflicts check.\n        1. Initialize `conflict = false`.\n        2. Iterate through events with `for i in eachindex(events)`.\n            1. Parse `start` and `finish` times of current event `i` using `DateTime(events[i].start_time, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")`, `DateTime(events[i].finish_time, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")` respectively.\n            2. For each subsequent event `j in (i+1):length(events)`, parse `start` and `finish` times of current event `j` using `DateTime(events[j].start_time, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")`, `DateTime(events[j].finish_time, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")` respectively.\n            3. Check for time conflict with `if start_time_i < finish_time_j && start_time_j < finish_time_i`.\n                1. Update `conflict = true` if there is a conflict.\n        3. Return result as `\"No conflicts\"` or `\"Conflict\"`.\n    2. Handle special case with empty event list: `if length(events) == 0 return \"No events\"`\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n    - Test it with a few sample inputs to ensure it produces the expected output and handles edge cases like overlapping events, non-overlapping events, and empty event list.\n\nRemember to use the package Dates for parsing dates in format \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,657],"elapsed":35.718896806,"_type":"aimessage"}]
