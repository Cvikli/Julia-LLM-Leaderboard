Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Then it sorts the events by their start times to make it easier to check for overlaps. Finally, it iterates through each event (starting from the second one) and compares its start time with the previous event's end time using the Time type from Dates. If any event starts before the previous one ends, there is a conflict, and the function returns `Conflict`. If no conflicts are found, it returns `No conflicts`.","status":200,"tokens":[325,316],"elapsed":58.905405188,"_type":"aimessage"}]
