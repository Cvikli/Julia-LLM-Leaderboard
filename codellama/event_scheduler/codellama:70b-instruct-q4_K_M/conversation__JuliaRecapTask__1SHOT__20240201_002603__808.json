X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

It checks if the list is empty and returns `\"No events\"` in that case. If not, it parses the event times using the `Dates` package's `Date` function with the specified date format. The events are sorted by start time to facilitate checking for overlapping events. Finally, a loop checks if any two consecutive events overlap (i.e., their end times are greater than each other's start times) and returns `\"Conflict\"` or `\"No conflicts\"` accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,374],"elapsed":20.2546589,"_type":"aimessage"}]
