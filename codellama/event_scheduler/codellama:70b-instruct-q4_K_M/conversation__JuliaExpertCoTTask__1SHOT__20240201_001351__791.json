It returns \"No conflicts\" if no overlapping events are found, \"Conflict\" otherwise, or \"No events\" if the provided list is empty. The function uses nested loops to compare each event with every other event in the list, checking if their start and end times overlap using the `DateTime` type from the Dates package. If an overlap is detected, it returns \"Conflict\". If no overlaps are found after comparing all events, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,402],"elapsed":21.931941927,"_type":"aimessage"}]
