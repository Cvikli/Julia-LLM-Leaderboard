Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

I have added comments to explain each step:\n```julia\nusing Dates  # Import the Dates package for parsing and comparing dates and times\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if isempty(events)  # If the events list is empty, return \"No events\"\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    sorted_events = sort(events; by=first)  # Sort the events based on start time\n    for i in 1:length(sorted_events)-1  # Iterate over all but the last event\n        current_event, next_event = sorted_events[i], sorted_events[i+1]\n        if Date(current_event[2]) > Date(next_event[1])  # Check for conflict (end of current event is after start of next event)\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    return \"No conflicts\"  # If we reach this point, there are no conflicts and we can return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThe `event_scheduler` function takes a vector of tuples as input where each tuple represents an event with the start time in the first element and finish time in the second. It then uses the Dates package to parse the dates from string format into `Date` objects, sorts them based on their start times, iterates through pairs of events checking for any conflicts (where the end time of one event is after the start time of the next), and finally returns \"No conflicts\" if no such conflicts are found.","status":200,"tokens":[0,378],"elapsed":20.621728484,"_type":"aimessage"}]
