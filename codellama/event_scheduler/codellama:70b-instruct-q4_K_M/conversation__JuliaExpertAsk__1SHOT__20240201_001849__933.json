Each event is represented by a tuple with the start time in first position and the finish time in second position. The function returns \"No events\" if there are no events, \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time, or \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events. It uses the `parse` function from the `Dates` package to parse the dates and times into `DateTime` objects. The function first checks if the list of events is empty and returns \"No events\" if it is. If not, it sorts the events based on their start times using the `sort` function. It then iterates over each event, except for the last one, and compares the end time of the current event with the start time of the next event. If the next event starts before the current one ends, a conflict is detected and \"Conflict\" is returned. If no conflicts are found after checking all events, \"No conflicts\" is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,446],"elapsed":23.973548405,"_type":"aimessage"}]
