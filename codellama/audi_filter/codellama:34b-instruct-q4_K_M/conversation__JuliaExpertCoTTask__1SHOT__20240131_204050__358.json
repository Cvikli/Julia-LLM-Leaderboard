Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

It first filters down the dataframe to only include rows where `manufacturer` is \"audi\" and `model` is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". This is done using a combination of the `filter()` function and the short-circuiting logical operators `&&`.\n2. Then, it creates a new column `audi_a4_type` that has the value `true` for all rows in the resulting dataframe. This is done by adding a new column to the dataframe using the `[]` notation, and then setting its values to `trues(nrow(df))`, which returns an array of `true` values with the same length as the number of rows in the dataframe.\n3. Finally, it returns the resulting dataframe.","status":200,"tokens":[0,321],"elapsed":8.930942905,"_type":"aimessage"}]
