Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can write the function `audi_filter`:\n```\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df::DataFrame)\n    df = filter(row -> row[:manufacturer] == \"audi\" && (row[:model] in (\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\")), df)\n    transform!(df, :audi_a4_type => ByRow(x -> x == \"a4\" || x == \"a4 quattro\"))\nend\n```\nThis function first filters the DataFrame `df` to only include rows where the manufacturer is \"audi\" and the model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". It then creates a new column `audi_a4_type` that is true for all rows in the filtered DataFrame. Finally, it returns the resulting DataFrame.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n```\ndf_cars = DataFrame(manufacturer = [\"audi\", \"toyota\", \"ford\"], model = [\"a4\", \"corolla\", \"focus\"])\ndf_cars_filtered = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```\nThis will create a new DataFrame `df_cars_filtered` that only includes the rows from `df_cars` where the manufacturer is \"audi\" and the model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". The resulting DataFrame will have a column `audi_a4_type` that is true for all rows.","status":200,"tokens":[0,328],"elapsed":9.01653464,"_type":"aimessage"}]
