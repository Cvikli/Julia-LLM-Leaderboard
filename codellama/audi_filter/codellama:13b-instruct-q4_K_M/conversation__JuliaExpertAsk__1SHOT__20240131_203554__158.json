Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how to do this in Julia:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df::DataFrame)\n    df = df[df[:manufacturer] .== \"audi\", :]\n    df = df[df[:model] .== \"a4\" || df[:model] .== \"a4 quattro\", :]\n    df.audi_a4_type = true\n    return df\nend\n```\nThis function first filters the DataFrame to only include rows where `manufacturer` is \"audi\". Then it filters the remaining rows to only include those where `model` is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". Finally, it adds a new column `audi_a4_type` and sets all values to `true`. The resulting DataFrame is returned.\n\nNote that in Julia, you can use the `.==` operator to compare two columns for equality.","status":200,"tokens":[0,204],"elapsed":2.664318929,"_type":"aimessage"}]
