Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

The first line filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer \"audi\" using the `.loc[]` method and the `[df_cars.manufacturer == 'audi']` syntax.\n2. The second line filters down the `model` column to only the values that contain either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". This is done using the `.str.contains()` method and passing a list of strings separated by the `|` character, which means \"or\".\n3. The third line creates a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `True` across all rows in the filtered DataFrame.\n4. The last line returns the resulting DataFrame with the additional column `audi_a4_type`.","status":200,"tokens":[329,306],"elapsed":6.913802396,"_type":"aimessage"}]
