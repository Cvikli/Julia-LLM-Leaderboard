Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"This function uses a logical indexing method to filter the dataframe on multiple conditions for manufacturer and model, creating a new column with all values as true based on the filtered data.\n\n```julia-repl\nusing DataFrames\nfunction audi_filter(df::DataFrame)\n    # Filtering rows with Audi A4 or A4 Quattro models\n    df = filter([:manufacturer, :model] => ((x, y)-> (x == \"audi\" && (y == \"a4\" || y == \"a4 quattro\"))) => df)\n    \n    # Adding a new column with all values as true\n    df[:, :audi_a4_type] .= true\n    \n    return df\nend\n```\nThe function first filters the dataframe using logical indexing to keep only rows where manufacturer equals \"audi\" and model equals \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\".
