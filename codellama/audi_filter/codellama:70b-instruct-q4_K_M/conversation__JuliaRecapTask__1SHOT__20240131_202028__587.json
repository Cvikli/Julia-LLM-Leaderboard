[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a DataFrame `df_cars` with car data with columns `manufacturer` and `model`.

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task (e.g., filtering DataFrames, creating new columns)\n2. Solve the Task by applying these snippets to filter the dataset and create a new column\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct by ensuring it returns the desired result\n\nPlease note that I have not tested this function with actual data, so you may need to make minor adjustments if there are any inconsistencies in the formatting of your DataFrame or specific requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,344],"elapsed":18.572294474,"_type":"aimessage"}]
