Define a function `audi_filter` that takes one argument, the DataFrame `df`. Inside the function:\n2. Filter the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer being \"audi\" using the `manufacturer .== \"audi\"` condition and assign the result to `df_audi`.\n3. Create a list of conditions on the model column for filtering down the dataset to only the rows with models \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". You can do this by using the `|` operator which represents OR logic. Assign the resulting condition to `model_conditions`.\n4. Filter the dataset further using the `model_conditions` and assign the result to `df_audi_models`.\n5. Add a new column `audi_a4_type` to the filtered DataFrame by setting all values in this column to `true`. You can do this by creating a new column with the same length as the DataFrame using the broadcasting operator `.`, and assigning it to `df_audi_models.audi_a4_type`.\n6. Return the resulting DataFrame from the function.\n7. Call the `audi_filter` function, passing in the `df_cars` DataFrame. The result will be a filtered DataFrame with only \"audi\" cars that have models \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\", and an additional column `audi_a4_type` indicating true across all rows.","status":200,"tokens":[0,308],"elapsed":16.531209178,"_type":"aimessage"}]
