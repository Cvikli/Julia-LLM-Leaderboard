Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

It filters down the dataset by selecting only rows where `manufacturer == \"audi\"` and `model` is either `\"a4\"` or `\"a4 quattro\"`. The filtered DataFrame is stored in `df_filtered`. Then, it creates a new column `audi_a4_type` and assigns `true` to all its entries. Finally, it returns the filtered DataFrame with the added column.","status":200,"tokens":[0,270],"elapsed":14.401924198,"_type":"aimessage"}]
