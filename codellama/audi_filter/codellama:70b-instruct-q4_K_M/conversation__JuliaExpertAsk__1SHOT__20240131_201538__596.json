Here's how you can write a function that filters out only Audi A4 and A4 quattro cars and adds a column indicating their type as Audi A4:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n# Define the DataFrame containing car data\ndf_cars = DataFrame(\n    manufacturer = [\"audi\", \"bmw\", \"toyota\", \"audi\"],\n    model = [\"a4\", \"x5\", \"camry\", \"a4 quattro\"]\n)\n\nfunction audi_filter(dataframe::DataFrame)\n    # Filter down to only Audi A4 and A4 quattro cars\n    filtered_df = dataframe[(dataframe.manufacturer .== \"audi\") .& (dataframe.model .in [\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"]), :]\n    # Create a new column indicating the type as Audi A4\n    filtered_df[:, :audi_a4_type] .= true\n    return filtered_df\nend\n\n# Call the function and store the result in a variable\nresult = audi_filter(df_cars)\n\nprintln(result) # Outputs the resulting DataFrame\n```\n\nThis code defines a `DataFrame` called `df_cars` with car data. It then defines a function called `audi_filter`. This function filters down to only Audi A4 and A4 quattro cars using boolean indexing and creates a new column indicating their type as Audi A4, setting the value to `true` across all rows. Finally, it returns the resulting DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,363],"elapsed":19.367820508,"_type":"aimessage"}]
