It first converts the string to lowercase using `lowercase`. Then, it strips any leading or trailing whitespaces using `strip`. Finally, it replaces any spaces and hyphens with an underscore using `replace(r\"\\s+\" => \"_\")`. The resulting string is returned as the cleaned column name.","status":200,"tokens":[0,123],"elapsed":1.636295411,"_type":"aimessage"}]
