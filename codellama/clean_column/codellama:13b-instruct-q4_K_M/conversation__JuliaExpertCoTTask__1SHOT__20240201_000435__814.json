First, we define a function called `clean_column` that takes in one argument `col`. Then, we use the `lowercase` function to convert the input column name to lowercase. Next, we use the `strip` function to remove any leading or trailing whitespaces from the converted column name. Finally, we use the `replace` function with a regular expression pattern `[ -]` to replace any spaces and hyphens in the converted column name with an underscore.\n\nTo test this code, you can run the following example:\n```julia\njulia> clean_column(\"My Column\")\n\"my_column\"\n```\nThis should output `\"my_column\"` as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[0,214],"elapsed":2.868113303,"_type":"aimessage"}]
