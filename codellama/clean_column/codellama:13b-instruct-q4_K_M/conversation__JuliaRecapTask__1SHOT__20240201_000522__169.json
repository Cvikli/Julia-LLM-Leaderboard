[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution to the task:\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col)\n    # Lowercase the column name\n    col = lowercase(col)\n    # Strip any leading or trailing whitespaces\n    col = strip(col)\n    # Replace spaces and hyphens with underscores\n    col = replace(col, r\" \", \"_\")\n    col = replace(col, r\"-\", \"_\")\n    return col\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `lowercase` function from Julia's `Strings` module to lowercase the column name. It then uses the `strip` function to remove any leading or trailing whitespaces. Finally, it replaces any spaces and hyphens with underscores using regular expressions. The resulting cleaned column name is returned as a string.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the input column name is a string. If you want to handle other types of columns (e.g., numbers), you can modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,219],"elapsed":2.977059499,"_type":"aimessage"}]
