It first uses the `strip` function to remove any leading and trailing whitespace characters. Then, it replaces all occurrences of spaces (`' '`) or hyphens (`'-'`) with underscores (`'_'`). Finally, it converts the entire string to lowercase using the `lowercase` function and returns it as a result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,196],"elapsed":7.953679361,"_type":"aimessage"}]
