It first converts the string to lowercase using the built-in `lowercase` function. Then it uses the `strip` function to remove leading and trailing spaces. Finally, it replaces any occurrences of space characters or hyphens with an underscore using the `replace` function. The cleaned column name is then returned by the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,197],"elapsed":7.994736014,"_type":"aimessage"}]
