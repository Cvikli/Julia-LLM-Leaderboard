You can use the `clean_column()` function to clean a column name in Julia as follows:\n```julia-repl\nfunction clean_column(col)::String\n    # Lowercase and strip leading/trailing whitespaces from the column name\n    col = lowercase(strip(col))\n    \n    # Replace any spaces or hyphens with an underscore\n    col = replace(col, r\"[\\s-]\" => \"_\")\n    \n    return col\nend\n```\n2. This function takes a string `col` as input and returns the cleaned column name as a string. It first converts the entire string to lowercase using `lowercase()`, then strips any leading or trailing whitespace characters with `strip()`.\n3. The `replace()` function is used to replace all occurrences of spaces (`\\s`) or hyphens (`-`) with an underscore (`_`). This ensures that the column name only contains alphanumeric characters and underscores, which is often a requirement for data processing and analysis.","status":200,"tokens":[0,229],"elapsed":12.250562809,"_type":"aimessage"}]
