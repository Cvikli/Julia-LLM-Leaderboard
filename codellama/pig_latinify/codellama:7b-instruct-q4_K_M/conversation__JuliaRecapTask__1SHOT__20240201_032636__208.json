[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `nthreads` function returns the number of available CPU cores, and the `chunk_size` variable is set to a value that allows each thread to process a equal amount of work. The `chunks` vector is used to split the input vector into smaller chunks, which can be processed in parallel.\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function creates a task for each chunk and waits for them to finish using the `wait` function. The `pig_latinify` function itself iterates over each string and converts it to Pig Latin by appending \"ay\" to the end of the word, followed by the first character of the original word.\n\nHere's an example usage of the `pig_latinify` function:\n```julia\nstrings = [\"hello\", \"world\"]\npig_latinify(strings)\nprintln(strings) # Output: [\"ellohay\", \"orldway\"]\n```\nNote that this solution uses a single-threaded approach to iterate over the input vector. If you need to process large datasets, you may want to consider using multi-threading or parallel processing techniques to improve performance.","status":200,"tokens":[0,609],"elapsed":5.268431148,"_type":"aimessage"}]
