[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `for` loop inside the task is responsible for iterating over each word in the string and applying the pig latin transformation. The resulting pig latin words are then joined back together with a space separator using the `join` function, and the result is put into the channel using the `put!` method. Finally, we close the channel using the `close` method to signal that all tasks are finished, and return the transformed strings from the channel using the `return` statement.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that each string in the input vector contains only one or more words separated by spaces. If your data may contain other types of delimiters or multiple sentences per string, you will need to modify the pig latin transformation code accordingly. Additionally, if performance is a concern, you may want to consider using Julia's `Parallel` module instead of `@spawn`, which provides more fine-grained control over parallel execution and can be more efficient for certain types of workloads.","status":200,"tokens":[0,551],"elapsed":4.751264832,"_type":"aimessage"}]
