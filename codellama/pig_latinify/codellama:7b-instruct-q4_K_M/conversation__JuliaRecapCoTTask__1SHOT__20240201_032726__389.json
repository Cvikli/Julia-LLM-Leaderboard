[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

We start by defining a function `pig_latinify` that takes a vector of strings as input and returns a vector of strings with the Pig Latin transformation applied to each string.\n2. The `Threads.@threads` macro is used to parallelize the loop over the elements of the input vector. This allows us to process the strings in parallel, which can speed up the computation if the input vector is large.\n3. Inside the loop, we define a function `string_to_pig_latin` that takes a single string as input and returns the Pig Latin transformation of that string. We use the `string_to_pig_latin` function to apply the Pig Latin transformation to each element of the input vector in parallel.\n4. The output of the loop is the resulting vector of strings with the Pig Latin transformation applied to each element.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that you have already defined the `string_to_pig_latin` function, which takes a single string as input and returns its Pig Latin equivalent. You can define this function yourself or use an existing implementation, such as the one provided by the `PigLatin` module in the Julia Standard Library.","status":200,"tokens":[0,405],"elapsed":3.473619317,"_type":"aimessage"}]
