The `convert_to_pig_latin` function is called for each string in parallel, and it should implement the actual pig latin conversion logic. Finally, the updated vector of strings is returned by the `pig_latinify` function.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the `convert_to_pig_latin` function is thread-safe, meaning that it can be called concurrently on multiple threads without causing race conditions or other issues. If your pig latin conversion logic does not require any global state or mutable variables, then you can safely use the `@threads` macro to parallelize the iteration over the strings. However, if your logic requires shared state or mutable variables, then you may need to implement a more complex concurrency mechanism, such as a lock-free data structure or a task queue.","status":200,"tokens":[0,331],"elapsed":2.80345027,"_type":"aimessage"}]
