Each thread is responsible for processing a single string and appending the result to the `result` array. The main thread then returns the `result` vector, which contains the Pig Latinified strings.\n\nNote that the `pig_latinize` function should be implemented according to the Pig Latin algorithm, which involves adding the suffix \"ay\" to each word in the input string and moving the first consonant (or consonant cluster) to the end of the word. For example, the word \"hello\" would become \"ellohay\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,231],"elapsed":1.962783195,"_type":"aimessage"}]
