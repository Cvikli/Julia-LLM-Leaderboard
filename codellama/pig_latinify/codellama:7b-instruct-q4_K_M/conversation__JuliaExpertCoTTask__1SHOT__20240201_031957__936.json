Each task is created using the `@spawn` macro, which schedules the task to run on a separate thread. The `fetch` function is then used to wait for all tasks to complete and gather their results.\n\nTo test this implementation, you can call the `pig_latinify` function with a vector of strings, like so:\n```\nstrings = [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]\nresult = pig_latinify(strings)\nprintln(result)\n```\nThis should print the Pig Latin translation of each string in the input vector.","status":200,"tokens":[205,565],"elapsed":9.874633506,"_type":"aimessage"}]
