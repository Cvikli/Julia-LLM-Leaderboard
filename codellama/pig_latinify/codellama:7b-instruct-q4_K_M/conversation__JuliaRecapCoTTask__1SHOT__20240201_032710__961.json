[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Define the function `pig_latinify` with the input argument `words`, which is a vector of strings.\n2. Use a loop to iterate over each string in `words`.\n3. Within the loop, use string indexing and slicing to extract the first letter of each word.\n4. Check if the first letter is a vowel by using a conditional statement such as `if word[1] in [\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"]`. If it is a vowel, add \"-way\" to the end of the word and return the result. Otherwise, move the first letter to the end of the word and add \"-ay\".\n5. Return the transformed words as a vector.\n\nHere's an example implementation:\n```scss\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    # Create a new vector to store the transformed words\n    transformed = []\n\n    # Iterate over each word in the input vector\n    for word in words\n        # Extract the first letter of the word\n        first_letter = word[1]\n\n        # Check if the first letter is a vowel\n        if first_letter in [\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"]:\n            # Add \"-way\" to the end of the word and return the result\n            transformed.append(word + \"-way\")\n        else:\n            # Move the first letter to the end of the word and add \"-ay\"\n            transformed.append(first_letter + word[1:] + \"-ay\")\n\n    # Return the transformed words as a vector\n    return transformed\n```\nTo run this function on separate threads, we can use the `Threads` module in Julia. Here's an example of how to use it:\n```scss\nusing Threads\n\n# Create a vector of strings to pass to the pig_latinify function\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"pig\", \"latin\"]\n\n# Use the @threads macro to run the function on separate threads\n@threads for word in words:\n    # Print each transformed word on a new line\n    println(word)\n```\nThis will create a pool of worker threads and apply the `pig_latinify` function to each string in the input vector. The output will be a vector of strings, where each string is the pig latin version of the corresponding word from the input vector.","status":200,"tokens":[0,570],"elapsed":4.991210817,"_type":"aimessage"}]
