Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)\n    # Create a pool of threads\n    pool = ThreadPool(length(strings))\n\n    # Iterate over the strings in parallel\n    for string in strings\n        pool.add_task(() -> pig_latinize!(string))\n    end\n\n    # Wait for all tasks to complete\n    pool.wait()\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinize!(string)\n    # Implement the pig latin transformation here\n    # ...\nend\n```\nThis code creates a thread pool with the same number of threads as the length of the input vector `strings`. It then iterates over each string in parallel using the `add_task` method, passing in a function that takes no arguments and simply calls the `pig_latinize!` function on the current string. Finally, it waits for all tasks to complete using the `wait` method.\n\nThe `pig_latinize!` function should be implemented to perform the actual pig latin transformation on each string. This can be done by splitting the string into individual characters, moving the first consonant or vowel to the end of the string, and then appending \"ay\" to the end of the resulting word. For example:\n```\nfunction pig_latinize!(string)\n    # Split the string into individual characters\n    chars = collect(string)\n\n    # Find the first consonant or vowel\n    for (i, char) in enumerate(chars)\n        if islowercase(char) || isuppercase(char)\n            break\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Move the first consonant or vowel to the end of the string\n    chars[end] = chars[i]\n    deleteat!(chars, i)\n\n    # Append \"ay\" to the end of the resulting word\n    string = join(chars, \"\") * \"ay\"\n\n    return string\nend\n```\nThis function splits the input string into individual characters using the `collect` method. It then iterates over each character in the string using a for loop, checking if it is a consonant or vowel using the `islowercase` and `isuppercase` methods. If it is not a consonant or vowel, it breaks out of the loop and moves on to the next string.\n\nOnce the first consonant or vowel has been found, it is moved to the end of the string using the `chars[end] = chars[i]` assignment. This shifts all characters in the string down by one position, making room for the consonant or vowel at the end. The `deleteat!` method is then used to delete the character that was moved to the end of the string.\n\nFinally, the resulting word is appended with \"ay\" using the `join` method and the resulting string is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[78,641],"elapsed":7.076166839,"_type":"aimessage"}]
