[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin.

The function first allocates an empty result vector of the same size as the input vector, and then iterates over each string using the `@threads` macro from the `Threads` module. Each iteration runs on a separate thread, which allows the function to take advantage of multi-threading for better performance.\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function is also defined to operate on a single string, which is called by each thread in the `@threads` loop. The implementation of this function is left as an exercise for the reader, but it should consist of splitting the input string into words, converting each word to Pig Latin, and then joining the words back together into a single string.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the `pig_latinify` function will be called with a vector of strings as input, and that each string in the vector is a single sentence or phrase. If the input strings are not sentences or phrases, but rather individual words, then the implementation of the `pig_latinify` function may need to be adjusted accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,381],"elapsed":10.70952338,"_type":"aimessage"}]
