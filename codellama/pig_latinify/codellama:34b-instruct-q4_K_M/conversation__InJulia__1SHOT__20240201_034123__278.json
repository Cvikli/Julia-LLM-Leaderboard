It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could implement the `pig_latinify` function in Julia:\n```\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    n = length(strings)\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, n)\n\n    Threads.@threads for i = 1:n\n        s = strings[i]\n        # Split the string into a vector of characters\n        chars = collect(eachmatch(r\"[\\w']+\", s))\n        # Iterate over each character and move it to the end of the word\n        # If the character is a letter, move it to the end of the word\n        for j = 1:length(chars)\n            if chars[j] == 'a' || chars[j] == 'e' || chars[j] == 'i' || chars[j] == 'o' || chars[j] == 'u'\n                result[i][j] = s[j]\n            else\n                result[i][j] = chars[j]\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n```\nThis function takes a vector of strings as input and returns a vector of strings where each string has been transformed to pig latin. The function uses the `Threads.@threads` macro to parallelize the computation, which can improve performance on multi-core machines.\n\nTo use this function, you can call it with a vector of strings as an argument, like this:\n```\nstrings = [\"hello\", \"world\"]\npig_latinify(strings)\n```\nThis will return a vector of strings where each string has been transformed to pig latin.","status":200,"tokens":[70,380],"elapsed":10.724248386,"_type":"aimessage"}]
