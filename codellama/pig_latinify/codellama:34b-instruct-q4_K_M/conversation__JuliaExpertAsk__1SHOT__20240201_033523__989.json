It uses the `Threads.@spawn` macro to create a separate thread for each iteration over the input vector, which allows for parallel processing. The `foreach(wait, threads)` statement at the end of the function waits for all threads to complete before returning from the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,202],"elapsed":5.601833347,"_type":"aimessage"}]
