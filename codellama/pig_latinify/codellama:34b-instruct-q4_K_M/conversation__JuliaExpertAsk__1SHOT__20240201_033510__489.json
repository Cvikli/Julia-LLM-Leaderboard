The results are stored in the `results` vector, which is returned at the end of the function.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the pig latinization can be done independently for each word in the input string. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the implementation accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,280],"elapsed":7.823438521,"_type":"aimessage"}]
