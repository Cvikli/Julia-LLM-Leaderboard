Inside the function, we create an empty array (`transformed`) to store our pig latinized strings. We then use `@threads` from ThreadPools package to parallelize the operation across multiple threads. For each string in `strings`, I've written code that applies the rules for transforming a string into Pig Latin and adds it to the `transformed` array. Finally, we return the transformed vector of strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,377],"elapsed":20.384065362,"_type":"aimessage"}]
