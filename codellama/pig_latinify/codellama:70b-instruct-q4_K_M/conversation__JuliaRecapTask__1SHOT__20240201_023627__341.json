X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It iterates over each string and changes it to pig Latin, running on separate threads for improved efficiency:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(word::String)\n    # Check if the word starts with a vowel\n    first_letter = lowercase(word[1])  # Convert to lower case to handle uppercase words\n    is_vowel = first_letter in \"aeiou\"  # Check if the first letter is a vowel\n\n    if is_vowel\n        return \"$word-way\"  # Add \"-way\" at the end for words starting with vowels\n    else\n        return \"$(word[2:end])$first_letter-ay\"  # Move the first letter to the end and add \"-ay\" for consonant words\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_vector(words::Vector{String})\n    transformed_words = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))  # Initialize an empty array of the same size as the input vector\n    \n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)  # Parallelize the loop using Julia's multi-threading features (@threads macro)\n        transformed_words[i] = pig_latinify(words[i])  # Transform each word and store it in the array\n    end\n    \n    return transformed_words  # Return the transformed words as a vector\nend\n```\n\nTo use this function, simply call `pig_latinify_vector` with a vector of strings:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\"]\ntransformed_words = pig_latinify_vector(words)  # Returns the transformed words in a new vector\nprintln(\"Original words: $words\")\nprintln(\"Pig latinified words: $transformed_words\")\n```\n\nThis code should be easy to understand and efficient, leveraging Julia's powerful multi-threading features.
