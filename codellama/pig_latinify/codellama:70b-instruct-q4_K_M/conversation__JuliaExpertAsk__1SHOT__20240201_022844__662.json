It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The code you provided is correct and I am going to explain the steps here:\n\n1. **The pig_latinify Function**: A function called `pig_latinify` that takes a vector of strings as its argument and returns the same vector transformed into Pig Latin. It iterates over each string in the input vector, transforming it to Pig Latin using the `@spawn` macro and `Task`.\n\n2. **Splitting Words**: For each word, we split it into characters, take the first letter, append \"ay\" to the end of the remaining letters, and then rejoin them to form a new string in Pig Latin format.\n\n3. **Multi-Threading**: The `@spawn` macro allows us to run the task on another thread so that we can process multiple words simultaneously. This is more efficient than processing each word sequentially.\n\n4. **Task Collection**: We collect all the tasks created using `Task[]`.\n\n5. **Wait for Tasks to Finish**: We use `wait` to wait for all the tasks to finish before we return the transformed vector.\n\nI hope this helps you understand how the code works. ðŸ˜Š","status":200,"tokens":[0,267],"elapsed":14.288200179,"_type":"aimessage"}]
