It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The code below implements the pig latin transformer function in Julia. The function `pig_latinify` operates on an input vector of strings, iterating over each string and modifying it to pig latin using the `@threads` macro which enables multi-threading.\n```julia\nfunction startswithvowel(word)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    return word[1] in vowels\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    new_words = Vector{String}()\n    @threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        if startswithvowel(lowercase(words[i]))\n            push!(new_words, words[i] * \"way\")\n        else\n            push!(new_words, string(chars(words[i])[2:end], chars(words[i])[1], \"ay\"))\n        end\n    end\n    return new_words\nend\n```\nThe `startswithvowel` function checks if a word starts with a vowel. The `@threads for i in 1:length(words)` loop iterates over each string in the input vector and transforms it to pig latin using rules such as adding \"way\" if the first letter is a vowel, or moving the first consonant to the end of the word and adding \"ay\". The transformed words are stored in a new vector `new_words` which is then returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,340],"elapsed":18.225741223,"_type":"aimessage"}]
