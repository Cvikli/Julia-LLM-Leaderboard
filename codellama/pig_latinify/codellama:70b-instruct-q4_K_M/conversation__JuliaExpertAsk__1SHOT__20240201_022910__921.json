Then it defines `transform_word`, which takes care of the actual pig latin transformation. The main function `pig_latinify` accepts a vector of strings and uses `@threads` for parallel processing. It iterates over each word in the list, transforms it to pig latin using `transform_word`, and appends the result to `transformed_words`. Finally, it returns the transformed words.","status":200,"tokens":[0,493],"elapsed":26.48132166,"_type":"aimessage"}]
