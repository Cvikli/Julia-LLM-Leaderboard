[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Define the `pig_latinify` function that takes in a vector of strings as input.\n2. Use Julia's built-in `Threads.@threads` macro to parallelize the loop over each string in the vector. This will distribute the work across multiple threads, potentially improving performance.\n3. Inside the threaded loop, use regular expressions (`Regex`) to extract the first letter of each word. If a word begins with a vowel (i.e., `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, or `u`), add \"way\" to the end of the word; otherwise, move the first letter to the end of the word and add \"ay\".\n4. Collect all the transformed words into an output vector called `output_vector`.\n5. Return the final `output_vector` from the function.\n\nHere's a Julia implementation that satisfies these requirements:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(input_vector)\n    # Initialize an empty output vector to store transformed words\n    output_vector = String[]\n\n    # Use threaded loop to process each word in parallel\n    Threads.@threads for word in input_vector\n        # Extract the first letter of the word using Regex\n        first_letter = match(r\"^[aeiou]?\", word).match\n\n        if first_letter == \"\"  # If the word begins with a vowel, add \"way\"\n            transformed_word = string(word, \"way\")\n        else                   # Otherwise, move the first letter to the end and add \"ay\"\n            transformed_word = string(word[2:end], word[1], \"ay\")\n        end\n\n        # Add the transformed word to the output vector\n        push!(output_vector, transformed_word)\n    end\n\n    return output_vector\nend\n```\n\nThis implementation uses Julia's built-in `Threads.@threads` macro for parallelism, which distributes the work across multiple threads. The function takes in a vector of strings (`input_vector`) and returns an array of transformed words (`output_vector`). It uses regular expressions to extract the first letter of each word, handles both vowel and consonant cases, and adds the appropriate suffixes (\"way\" or \"ay\"). The output is collected in `output_vector` and returned from the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,524],"elapsed":28.444560206,"_type":"aimessage"}]
