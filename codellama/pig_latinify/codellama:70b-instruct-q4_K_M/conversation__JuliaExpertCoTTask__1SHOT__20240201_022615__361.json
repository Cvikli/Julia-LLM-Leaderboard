It iterates over each word, creating a new task for each one using `@spawn`. Each task converts the current word to pig latin and writes the result into the channel. The main thread waits for all tasks to finish and then collects the results from the channel into an array.","status":200,"tokens":[0,261],"elapsed":14.066547549,"_type":"aimessage"}]
