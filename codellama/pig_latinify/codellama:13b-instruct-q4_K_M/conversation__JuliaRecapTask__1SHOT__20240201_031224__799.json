[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

This function is just a wrapper around the `pig_latinify_threaded` function, which we'll discuss next.\n* The `pig_latinify_threaded` function uses the `@spawn` macro from the Threads module to create an asynchronous task that runs the `pig_latinify` function on each string in the input vector. We use the `.|>` syntax to apply the `pig_latinify_string` function to each element of the input vector.\n* The `pig_latinify_string` function takes in a single string as input, and returns its pig latin equivalent. This function first checks if the word starts with a vowel, in which case it appends \"-way\" to the end of the word. Otherwise, it checks if the word starts with \"h\" but not \"h-\", in which case it moves the \"h\" to the end of the word and appends \"-hay\". Finally, it moves the first letter to the end of the word and appends \"-ay\".\n* We use the `strip` function to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the pig latin equivalent.\n\nNote that we're using the `.|>` syntax to apply the `pig_latinify_string` function to each element of the input vector, which is more concise and easier to read than a for-loop. We also use the `strip` function to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the pig latin equivalent.","status":200,"tokens":[0,594],"elapsed":8.321200334,"_type":"aimessage"}]
