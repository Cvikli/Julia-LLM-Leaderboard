[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution:\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(v::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    return map(x -> replace(x, r\"^([a-zA-Z])(.*)$\", s\"\\1$2ay\"), v)\nend\n```\nThis solution uses the `map` function to iterate over each string in the input vector and apply the pig latin transformation to it. The transformation is done using a regular expression that captures the first letter of the word and replaces it with itself followed by \"ay\".\n\nIt's important to note that this solution assumes that all words are only made up of letters, if there are any non-letter characters in the input strings they will be removed. Also, it's using the `replace` function to perform the transformation, this function is designed for simple substitutions and is not suitable for more complex transformations.","status":200,"tokens":[0,196],"elapsed":2.717665965,"_type":"aimessage"}]
