It uses a map function to iterate over each string and apply the pig latin transformation to it. The transformation is done by iterating over each character in the string and checking if it is a vowel or not. If it is, we add \"way\" to the end of the string. If it's not, we add \"ay\" to the end of the string. Finally, we return the transformed string.\n\nNote that this function assumes that each string in the input vector contains only lowercase letters. If you want to handle uppercase letters as well, you can modify the `if` statement to check for both uppercase and lowercase vowels.","status":200,"tokens":[0,365],"elapsed":4.935738133,"_type":"aimessage"}]
