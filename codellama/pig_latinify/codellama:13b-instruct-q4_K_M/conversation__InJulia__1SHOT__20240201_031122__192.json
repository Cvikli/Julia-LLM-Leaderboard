Each task is executed on a separate thread and transforms the string to pig latin. The function then waits for all tasks to complete using `Threads.wait`, and returns the transformed strings as an array.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input vector contains only valid UTF-8 strings, and that the transformation from English to pig latin is well-defined. If the input vector contains invalid or malformed strings, or if the pig latin transformation is not defined for all possible inputs, additional error handling may be necessary.","status":200,"tokens":[78,269],"elapsed":12.205182069,"_type":"aimessage"}]
