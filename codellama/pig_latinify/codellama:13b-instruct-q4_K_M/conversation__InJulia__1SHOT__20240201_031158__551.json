We create a new vector `pig_latin_words` to store the Pig Latin words and add them to it using the `push!` function.\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function takes a single string as an argument and returns its Pig Latin equivalent. It first checks if the word is empty or consists only of whitespace characters, in which case it returns an empty string. Otherwise, it splits the word into individual letters using the `split` function and creates a new vector to store the Pig Latin letters.\n\nFor each letter in the word, we check if it's a vowel or not. If it's a vowel, we move it to the end of the word. If it's an uppercase Y, we change it to AY and move it to the end of the word. Otherwise, we add it to the vector without modification. Finally, we join the Pig Latin letters back into a string and return it using the `join` function.\n\nYou can use this function in your program by calling it with a vector of strings as an argument:\n```julia\n# Create a vector of words to transform to Pig Latin\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\"]\n\n# Transform the words to Pig Latin using the `pig_latinify` function\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\n\n# Print the transformed words\nprintln(pig_latin_words)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,881],"elapsed":12.176008336,"_type":"aimessage"}]
