It uses the `Threading` module to create separate threads for each string, and then joins the results together into a single string.\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function first creates an empty vector of threads called `threads`. It then iterates over each word in the input vector, and creates a new thread using the `Thread` constructor. The new thread is passed a lambda expression that calls the `pig_latin_word` function with the current word as an argument.\n\nThe `pig_latin_word` function takes a string as input, and returns a pig latinized version of the string. It checks if the word starts with a vowel, and if so, it returns the word with \"way\" added to the end. Otherwise, it finds the index of the first vowel in the word using the `findfirst` function, and then returns the word with the letters up to the first vowel replaced by \"ay\", followed by the original letters from the first vowel onward.\n\nFinally, the `pig_latinify` function joins all of the results together into a single string using the `join` function, and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[70,532],"elapsed":7.140793676,"_type":"aimessage"}]
