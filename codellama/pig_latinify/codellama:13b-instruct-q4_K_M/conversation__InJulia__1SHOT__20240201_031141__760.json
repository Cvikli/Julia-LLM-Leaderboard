The function uses the `@threads` macro to parallelize the string transformation using multiple threads. Each iteration of the loop runs on a separate thread, which allows the transformation to be performed faster than in a single-threaded implementation.\n\nThe `pig_latin_transformer` function is defined as a nested function inside the `pig_latinify` function. This function takes a string as input and returns the Pig Latin version of that string. The function splits the string into individual characters, finds the first vowel in the string, moves it to the end of the word, and then joins the characters back together to form a new string.\n\nThe `@threads` macro is used to parallelize the loop over the strings using multiple threads. Each thread runs its own copy of the `pig_latin_transformer` function, which allows each thread to process a separate string in parallel. The results are then collected into the output vector and returned by the `pig_latinify` function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,516],"elapsed":7.007275678,"_type":"aimessage"}]
