Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strs::Vector{String})\n    return strs |> map(x -> x |> map(y -> y |> pig_latinify))\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(str::String)\n    if endswith(str, \"qu\")\n        return str[1:end-2] * \"quay\"\n    elseif endswith(str, \"s\")\n        return str[1:end-1] * \"sway\"\n    else\n        return str * \"way\"\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function takes a vector of strings as input and returns a vector of pig latin translations. The `map` function is used to apply the transformation to each element in the input vector, and the `pig_latinify` function is applied to each string in the input vector using the `map` function.\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function takes a single string as input and returns its pig latin translation. It uses a series of conditional statements to check if the string ends with \"qu\", \"s\" or not, and applies the appropriate transformation based on these conditions.\n\nNote that this code assumes that you have already defined the `pig_latinify` function in your code. If you haven't, you can define it as follows:\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(str::String)\n    if endswith(str, \"qu\")\n        return str[1:end-2] * \"quay\"\n    elseif endswith(str, \"s\")\n        return str[1:end-1] * \"sway\"\n    else\n        return str * \"way\"\n    end\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,394],"elapsed":5.302882903,"_type":"aimessage"}]
