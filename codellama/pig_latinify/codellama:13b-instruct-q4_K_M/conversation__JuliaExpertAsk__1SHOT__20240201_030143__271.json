The `pig_latinify` function takes a single string as input and returns the pig latin version of that string. If the input string is less than 2 characters long, it is returned unchanged. Otherwise, the first letter is extracted and used to determine whether the rest of the word should be uppercase or lowercase. Finally, the rest of the word is concatenated with \"ay\" and returned.\n\nNote that this code uses the `uppercasefirst` and `lowercasefirst` functions from the `UppercaseFirst` module to ensure that the first letter of the pig latin version of a word is uppercase or lowercase, respectively.","status":200,"tokens":[0,313],"elapsed":4.225304225,"_type":"aimessage"}]
