[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of `pig_latinify`:\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(str::AbstractString)\n    # Split the string into words\n    words = split(str, r\"[\\W\\d]+\")\n\n    # Iterate over each word and convert it to Pig Latin\n    for word in words\n        if length(word) <= 3\n            word = \"$wordway\"\n        else\n            first_letter = word[1]\n            rest_of_word = word[2:end]\n            word = \"$rest_of_word$first_letteray\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return words\nend\n```\nThis function takes a string `str` as input and returns the Pig Latin version of it. It first splits the string into individual words using `split(str, r\"[\\W\\d]+\")`, where `\\W` matches any non-word character and `\\d` matches any digit.\n\nNext, we iterate over each word in the vector of words and apply the Pig Latin transformation to it. If the length of a word is less than or equal to 3, we simply add \"way\" to the end of it. Otherwise, we take the first letter of the word, remove it from the original string, and concatenate the remaining letters with \"ay\".\n\nFinally, we return the vector of transformed words.","status":200,"tokens":[0,313],"elapsed":4.258909534,"_type":"aimessage"}]
