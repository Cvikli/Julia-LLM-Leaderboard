It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can write code for this task in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    return Threads.map(words) do word\n        first = word[1]\n        rest = chopfirst(word)\n        if first == 'a' || first == 'e' || first == 'i' || first == 'o' || first == 'u'\n            return \"$rest-$first\"\n        else\n            return \"$rest-$firstay\"\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n*   The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of words as input. It then uses the `Threads.map` function to iterate over each word and perform the pig latin transformation.\n*   For each word, we first extract the first letter using `word[1]`. We also store the rest of the word in the variable `rest`.\n*   We then check if the first letter is a vowel by comparing it with 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'. If it is a vowel, we return the pig latin transformation as `\"$rest-$first\"`.\n*   Otherwise, we return the transformation as `\"$rest-$firstay\"`.\n*   The `chopfirst` function is used to remove the first letter from the word.\n*   Finally, we return the transformed words as a vector of strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,324],"elapsed":13.317732146,"_type":"aimessage"}]
