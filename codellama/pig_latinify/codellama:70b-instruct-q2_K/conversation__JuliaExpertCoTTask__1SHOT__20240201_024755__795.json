You need to write a function called `pig_latinify` that takes as input a vector of strings, such as `[\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]`. It should operate on each string in this vector by transforming it into pig latin and outputting the transformed strings. Each transformation should run on a separate thread to optimize for efficiency.\n\nIf you provide an example input of `pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])`, then I can help you with writing this function. Can you clarify if that's what you meant, or if there is something else you need me to explain?","status":200,"tokens":[0,152],"elapsed":6.189150464,"_type":"aimessage"}]
