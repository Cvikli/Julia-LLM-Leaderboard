Julia uses green threads for parallelism, which are lighter-weight than OS-level threads. This can be achieved by using the `Base.Threads` module:\n\n ```julia\nusing Base.Threads # Import Threads package to use multithreading in Julia\n\nfunction pig_latinify(input)\n    output = []\n    function f(word, i)\n        if occursin(r\"^[aeiouy]\", word)  # If first letter is a vowel\n            push!(output, \"$(word)-ay\")  # Add suffix '-ay' to the word\n        else\n            suffix = string((word[1]), \"-\")  # Extract consonant prefix\n            for ch in word[2:end]  # Iterate over remaining characters\n                if occursin(r\"[aeiouy]\", ch)  # If first vowel is found\n                    push!(output, \"$(word[occursin.(ch, word) ? i : end]), $(suffix)ay\")  # Add pig latin to output array\n                break\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    Threads.@threads for (i, word) in enumerate(input)  # Iterate over input words in parallel using threads\n        f(word, i)\n    end\nend\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   `Base.Threads` is imported to access multithreading capabilities.\n*   The function `pig_latinify` takes an array of strings (`input`) as input and returns the transformed words as a string vector. It creates an empty output vector where the pig latin results will be stored.\n*   A nested function `f` is defined to handle the pig latin conversion logic. If the first letter of the word matches a vowel, it appends \"-ay\" to the word and adds it to the output. Otherwise, it extracts the consonant prefix and iterates over the remaining letters until it finds a vowel. It then adds the suffix \"ay\" after the word.\n*   The `Threads.@threads` macro is used to parallelize the `for` loop that processes each word in the input vector. This distributes the workload among multiple threads, which can greatly speed up the process for large inputs.\n*   Once the pig latin transformation has been applied to all words, the function returns the transformed string vector as output.","status":200,"tokens":[84,539],"elapsed":22.398687242,"_type":"aimessage"}]
