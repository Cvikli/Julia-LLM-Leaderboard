[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

Write a function called `pig_latinify` that accepts a vector of strings as input.\n2. Use the `foreach` loop to iterate over each string in the vector, and apply pig latin transformations to it.\n3. In the transformation, if a word starts with a vowel, add \"ay\" to the end of the word. For example: \"apple\" becomes \"appleay\".\n4. If a word starts with a consonant, move all the consonants before the first vowel to the end of the word and then add \"ay\". For example: \"hello\" becomes \"ellohay\".\n5. You can check if a letter is a vowel by using the `in` function (e.g., `'a' in \"aeiou\"` returns True).\n6. Once all the words have been transformed, return the vector of modified strings.\n7. To run each transformation on its own thread, you can use Julia's multithreading capabilities. You can look up the `@threads` macro for more details.\n8. Lastly, test your function with the provided input data and ensure it outputs the correct result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,253],"elapsed":10.43433362,"_type":"aimessage"}]
