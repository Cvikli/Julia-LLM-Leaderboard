You can also use Julia's REPL to interact with the code directly.\n\nHere is an example usage:\n\n```\nEnter a sentence to be transformed into Pig Latin:\nHello, world!\nellohay, orldway!\n```\n\nNote that this script only operates on one thread and does not use parallelism. To improve performance, consider using Julia's multi-threading capabilities.","status":200,"tokens":[0,503],"elapsed":20.617975797,"_type":"aimessage"}]
