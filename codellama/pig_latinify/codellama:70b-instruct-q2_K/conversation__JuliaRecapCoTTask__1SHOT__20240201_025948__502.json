[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The function `pig_latinify` splits words into separate words if there is a space in between. If it's a single word, it calls the helper function `pig_latinify_single_word` to apply the pig latin transformation.\n\nThis implementation uses Julia's multithreading capabilities (`Threads.@threads`) to distribute the task across multiple threads in parallel, ensuring efficient processing of large vectors of words.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes a basic understanding of Julia and will not work for more complex cases (e.g., handling punctuation or special characters). Additionally, it may not be suitable for very large datasets due to the overhead associated with multithreading.","status":200,"tokens":[0,511],"elapsed":21.276053824,"_type":"aimessage"}]
