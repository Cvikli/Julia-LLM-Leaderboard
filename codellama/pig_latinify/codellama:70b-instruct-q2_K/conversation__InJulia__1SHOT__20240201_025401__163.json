Run the code below in Julia's REPL (or add it to a Julia script). This will define our `pig_latinify` function and import necessary modules.\n\n    ```julia\n    using Base, ThreadPools\n    function pig_latinify(word::String)\n        vowels = \"aeiou\" # list of vowel characters\n        if length(word) == 0\n            return word\n        end\n        first_char = lowercase(word[1]) # get the first character in the word, convert to lower case\n        \n        if findfirst(vowels, first_char) != nothing # check if it's a vowel\n            return \"$wordway\" \n        else\n            return \"$(word[2:end])$first_charay\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    function pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n        Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words) # iterate over all words, running on separate threads\n            words[i] = pig_latinify(words[i]) \n        end\n        return words\n    end\n    ```\n    \n2. Run the `pig_latinify` function with your input vector of strings:\n\n    ```julia\n    my_sentence = [\"hello\", \"world\"] # input sentence\n    pig_latinified = pig_latinify(my_sentence) # call our pig_latinify function on the input\n    println(pig_latinified) # print out the transformed result\n    ```\n    \n3. The `pig_latinify` function will transform your input vector of strings to Pig Latin and return the transformed sentence as a string vector. You can use it in any way you like, e.g., printing the result or writing it to a file.","status":200,"tokens":[0,427],"elapsed":17.418483777,"_type":"aimessage"}]
