[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Check the special instructions you provided: \"Use Julia's standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested\"\n2. Write code that meets these requirements:\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(input)::Vector{String}\n    output = Vector{String}(undef, length(input)) # Pre-allocate a vector of strings for the transformed elements\n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(input) do # Iterate over the input vector, running each iteration on a separate thread\n        word = input[i]\n        if islowercase(word[1]) # Check that the first letter is lowercase (no transformation needed for uppercase words)\n            prefix_suffixes = (\"ay\", \"way\") # Define the pig latin suffixes to be used depending on whether the word starts with a vowel or consonant\n            if length(word) == 1 || occursin(r\"[aeiou]\", word) == 1 # Check if the first letter is a vowel, or if there's only one letter in the word (to decide which suffix to use)\n                output[i] = \"$word$(prefix_suffixes[2])\"\n            else\n                output[i] = \"$(uppercasefirst(word[2:end]))$(word[1])$(prefix_suffixes[1])\"\n            end\n        else # If the word is all uppercase, leave it as-is (no transformation needed)\n            output[i] = word\n        end\n    end\n    return output\nend\n```\nNote that this function assumes that the input vector contains only strings. You may need to modify this code if your input vector contains other types of data. Additionally, the pig latin rules are simplified for brevity and might not cover all possible cases. You can add more complex logic as needed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,416],"elapsed":17.26952457,"_type":"aimessage"}]
