The function first checks if the word starts with a vowel or is empty. If that's the case, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word and returns it. Otherwise, it iterates through the word until it finds the first vowel, splits the string there, and then appends \"ay\" to the suffix. It then returns the transformed word.\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings (`words`) as input. It creates an empty vector of strings (`result`), whose length is equal to the number of words in the input vector. It then iterates over each index in the result vector using `@threads for`, which allows multiple threads to operate concurrently. In each iteration, it applies `english_to_pig_latin` to the current word and stores the transformed word in the corresponding position in the `result` vector. Finally, it returns the transformed words as a vector of strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,577],"elapsed":23.730727139,"_type":"aimessage"}]
