[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The function should iterate over the strings using separate threads to ensure efficient parallelization.\n\nHere's a code template for the function:\n```julia-repl\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String}) :: Vector{String}\n    # Create a thread pool with as many threads as there are words in the input vector\n    Threads.nthreads() = length(words)\n\n    # Iterate over each word, transforming it to pig latin on a separate thread\n    pig_latin_words :: Vector{String} = []\n    for word in words\n        Threads.@spawn begin\n            # Transform the current word to pig latin and add it to the output list\n            push!(pig_latin_words, transform_to_pig_latin(word)) \n        end\n    end\n\n    return pig_latin_words\nend\n```\n\nYou can assume that the `transform_to_pig_latin` function is defined elsewhere and will convert a single word to pig latin. You should only focus on creating a thread pool, iterating over each input word, and transforming it to pig latin using separate threads.\n\nPlease note that I am not providing any more details or specifications for the `transform_to_pig_latin` function.
