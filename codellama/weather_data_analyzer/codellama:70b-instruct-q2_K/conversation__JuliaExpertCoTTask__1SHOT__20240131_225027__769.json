Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is my code for the task:\n```julia\nusing Statistics\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0 # check if input list is empty\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing) # all values are set to nothing\n    end\n    average = mean(temps) # calculate the average temperature value\n    max_temp = maximum(temps) # find the highest temperature\n    min_temp = minimum(temps) # find the lowest temperature\n    if length(temps) == 1 # check if there is only one element in temps list\n        trend = :stable # set trend to :stable since we cannot determine a trend with just one value\n    elseif temps[length(temps)] > temps[length(temps)-1] # compare the last two values\n        trend = :increasing # if the last temperature is greater than the second-last, set trend to :increasing\n    elseif temps[length(temps)] < temps[length(temps)-1]\n        trend = :decreasing # if the last temperature is less than the second-last, set trend to :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable # otherwise, set trend to :stable (if the temperatures are equal)\n    end\n    return (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function should be able to handle empty data sets as well.
