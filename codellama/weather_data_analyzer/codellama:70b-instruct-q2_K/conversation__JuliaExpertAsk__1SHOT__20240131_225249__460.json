Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Hi! I'm your friendly Julia programming language assistant. 😊 I can help you create a function that performs statistical analyses on daily temperature data and returns a named tuple with the results. Here's what I came up with:\n\n```julia-repl\nusing Statistics # Importing Statistics package to calculate statistics\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{Int})\n    if isempty(temps) # Checking for empty data input\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n    average_temp = mean(temps)  # Calculating average temperature\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)  # Calculating max temperature\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)  # Calculating min temperature\n    trend = :stable  # Initializing trend to :stable by default\n    if temps[end] > temps[1]  # Checking for increasing trend (last value greater than first value)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif temps[end] < temps[1]  # Checking for decreasing trend (last value lesser than first value)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n    return (average=average_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)  # Returning the results as a named tuple\nend\n```\n\nI hope this code snippet helps you get started. You can modify it according to your specific requirements and use it in your project! 👍","status":200,"tokens":[0,353],"elapsed":14.457235426,"_type":"aimessage"}]
