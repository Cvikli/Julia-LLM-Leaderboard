[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"1. Import the package and create a function\n```julia\nusing Statistics  # for statistical analysis\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    ...\nend\n```\n\n2. Check if input is empty, then return named tuple with all values set to `nothing`\n```julia\nif length(temps) == 0\n    return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=:none)\nend\n```\n3. Calculate average temperature\n```julia\navg_temp = mean(temps)\n```\n4. Find the maximum and minimum temperatures\n```julia\nmax_temp = maximum(temps)\nmin_temp = minimum(temps)\n```\n5.

If there is no data, it returns a tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,567],"elapsed":23.432065077,"_type":"aimessage"}]
