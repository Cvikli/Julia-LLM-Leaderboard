The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`).

Write a function named `weather_data_analyzer` that calculates statistical results (average, max, min temperatures) using the `Statistics` package. The function should also determine whether the trend is increasing, decreasing, or stable based on the given data. If the list is empty, it should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\nIf my understanding is correct, I'll provide you with a detailed response on how to approach this task.
