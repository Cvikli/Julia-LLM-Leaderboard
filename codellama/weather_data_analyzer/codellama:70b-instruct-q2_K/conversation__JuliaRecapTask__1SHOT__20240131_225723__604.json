[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics: mean, median\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::AbstractArray{Number})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max = maximum(temps)\n    min = minimum(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 1\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif median(temps[2:end]) > median(temps[1:end-1])\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif median(temps[2:end]) < median(temps[1:end-1])\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average, max, min, trend)\nend\n```\n\nI have provided a solution that implements the requested function and uses the Statistics package to calculate the mean value of the array. It also returns a named tuple with the calculated values for `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and `trend`. The trend is calculated by comparing the median temperature values in two successive parts of the array using the median function from the Statistics package.\n\nThe function handles the case where the input list (`temps`) is empty by returning a named tuple with all fields set to `nothing`.\n\nI hope this meets your requirements!
