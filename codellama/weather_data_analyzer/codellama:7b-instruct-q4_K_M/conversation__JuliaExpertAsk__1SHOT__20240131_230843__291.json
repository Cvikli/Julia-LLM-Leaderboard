Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max = maximum(temps)\n    min = minimum(temps)\n    if isempty(unique(diff(temps)))\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif diff(temps)[1] > 0\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n    return (; average, max, min, trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list is empty and returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing` in that case. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum, minimum, and trend of the temperature data using the `Statistics` package functions. The `trend` is calculated by checking if there are any differences between consecutive elements in the list using `diff`. If there are no differences, the trend is set to `:stable`, otherwise it is determined based on the sign of the first difference. Finally, a named tuple with the calculated values is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,274],"elapsed":2.34454726,"_type":"aimessage"}]
