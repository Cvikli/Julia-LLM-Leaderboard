Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max = maximum(temps)\n    min = minimum(temps)\n    trend = :increasing\n\n    if any(diff -> diff < 0, temps[2:end])\n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif any(diff -> diff > 0, temps[2:end])\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=average, max=max, min=min, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `Statistics` package to calculate the mean, maximum, minimum, and trend of the temperature data. If the list is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the trend by checking if any consecutive differences are less than 0 (decreasing), greater than 0 (increasing), or equal to 0 (stable). The trend is then returned in the named tuple along with the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures.","status":200,"tokens":[0,282],"elapsed":2.354398993,"_type":"aimessage"}]
