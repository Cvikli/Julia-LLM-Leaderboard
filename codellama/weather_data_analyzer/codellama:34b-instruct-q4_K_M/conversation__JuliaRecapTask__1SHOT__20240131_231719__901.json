X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers).

If it is, we return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, we proceed with calculating the average, maximum, minimum temperatures, and determining the trend using the `Statistics` package. We use the `mean` function to calculate the average temperature, the `maximum` function to calculate the maximum temperature, and the `minimum` function to calculate the minimum temperature.\n\nTo determine the trend, we first check if there are at least two elements in the input list and if any of the differences between consecutive elements is non-zero. If either of these conditions is false, we set the trend to `:stable`. Otherwise, we fit a linear regression line to the data using the `Polynomials.fit` function from the `Polynomials` package and calculate the slope of the line. We then use this slope to determine whether the trend is increasing, decreasing, or stable.\n\nFinally, we return a named tuple with the results using the `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax for constructing a named tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,668],"elapsed":18.880891035,"_type":"aimessage"}]
