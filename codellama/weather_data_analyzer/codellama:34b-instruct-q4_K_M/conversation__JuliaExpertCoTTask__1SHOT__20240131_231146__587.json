Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how I would approach this task:\n\n1. Think through my approach step by step:\n\t* First, I would check if the input list is empty and return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing` if it is.\n\t* Then, I would calculate the average temperature using the `mean()` function from the `Statistics` package.\n\t* Next, I would find the minimum and maximum temperatures using the `min()` and `max()` functions from the same package.\n\t* Finally, I would check if the temperature trend is increasing, decreasing, or stable by comparing the first and last temperatures in the list. If the first temperature is less than the last temperature, the trend is increasing. If the first temperature is greater than the last temperature, the trend is decreasing. Otherwise, the trend is stable.\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n\t* I would define a function called `weather_data_analyzer()` that takes in a list of daily temperature data as its input.\n\t* Inside the function, I would use the `mean()`, `min()`, and `max()` functions from the `Statistics` package to calculate the average, minimum, and maximum temperatures.\n\t* I would also define a variable called `trend` that stores the temperature trend (either `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`).\n3. Solve the task:\n\t* Using the functions and variables defined in step 2, I would calculate the average, minimum, maximum, and trend of the input list of temperatures.\n4. Check that my solution is correct:\n\t* I would test my function with a few different inputs to make sure it produces the expected output for each case. For example, I might test it with an empty list, a list containing only one temperature value, and a list containing multiple temperature values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,415],"elapsed":11.651636045,"_type":"aimessage"}]
