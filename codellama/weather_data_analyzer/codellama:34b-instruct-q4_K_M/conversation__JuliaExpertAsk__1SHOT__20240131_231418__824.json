Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the code that answers your question:\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Real})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    stats = describe(temps)\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max = maximum(temps)\n    min = minimum(temps)\n    trend = ifelse(isincreasing(stats.correlation), :increasing, :decreasing)\n\n    return (; average=average, max=max, min=min, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nHere's an explanation of the code:\n\n1. The function `weather_data_analyzer` takes a vector of temperatures as input and returns a named tuple containing the average, maximum, minimum, and trend (increasing, decreasing, or stable) of the temperatures.\n2. If the input vector is empty, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n3. Otherwise, it uses the `describe` function from the `Statistics` package to calculate the statistical description of the temperatures and extracts the correlation coefficient.\n4. The function then calculates the average, maximum, minimum, and trend (using the `isincreasing` function) based on the calculated statistics.\n5. Finally, it returns a named tuple with the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,336],"elapsed":9.370178806,"_type":"aimessage"}]
