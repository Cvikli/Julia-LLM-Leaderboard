X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers).

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task: We need to calculate average, maximum, minimum, and trend of a vector of temperatures. \n2. Solve the Task: We create a function `weather_data_analyzer` that takes a vector of temperatures `temps::Vector{Number}` as input and returns a named tuple containing the average temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and trend (either `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct: We make sure that our function works for various input cases by testing it with different inputs and checking the output against the desired result. For example, we can test the function with an empty temperature list and ensure that it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,342],"elapsed":4.689189995,"_type":"aimessage"}]
