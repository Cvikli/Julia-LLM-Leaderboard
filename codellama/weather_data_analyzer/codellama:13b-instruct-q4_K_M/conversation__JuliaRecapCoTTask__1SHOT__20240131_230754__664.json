[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Using Julia's Statistics library to perform statistical analysis on temperature data, we can write the following function:\n```julia\nusing Statistics\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max = maximum(temps)\n    min = minimum(temps)\n    trend = if any(x -> x > average, temps) && all(x -> x >= average, temps)\n        :increasing\n    elseif any(x -> x < average, temps) && all(x -> x <= average, temps)\n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n    return (; average=average, max=max, min=min, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nWe first check if the input list `temps` is empty. If it is, we return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\nOtherwise, we calculate the average temperature using `mean()`, the maximum and minimum temperatures using `maximum()` and `minimum()`, respectively. We then determine the trend of the data by checking if any of the temperatures are greater than the average, and if they all are greater or equal to the average (i.e., it's increasing). If none of the conditions are met, we check if any of the temperatures are less than the average, and if they all are less or equal to the average (i.e., it's decreasing). Otherwise, it's stable.\n\nFinally, we return a named tuple containing the average temperature, maximum, minimum, and trend data.","status":200,"tokens":[0,383],"elapsed":5.267433136,"_type":"aimessage"}]
