Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's one possible solution:\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{T}) where {T<:Real}\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    stats = mean_and_std(temps)\n    avg = first(stats)\n    stddev = last(stats)\n    minval = minimum(temps)\n    maxval = maximum(temps)\n    trend = ifelse(avg > avg - stddev, :increasing, :decreasing)\n\n    (; average=avg, max=maxval, min=minval, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nLet me explain the solution:\n\n1. The function `mean_and_std` from the `Statistics` package is used to compute the mean and standard deviation of the temperature data.\n2. The `ifelse` function is used to determine the trend of the temperatures based on whether the average temperature is greater than the average temperature minus the standard deviation.\n3. The named tuple `(; average=avg, max=maxval, min=minval, trend=trend)` is constructed with the results from the analysis. If the list is empty, all values are set to `nothing`.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the input data is in the form of a vector of real numbers. If the input data is not in this format, you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,350],"elapsed":4.790076788,"_type":"aimessage"}]
