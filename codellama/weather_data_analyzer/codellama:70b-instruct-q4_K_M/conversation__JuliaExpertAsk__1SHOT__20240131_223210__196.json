Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"1. Check whether the input temperature data is empty. If it is, return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing` (the function should return `NamedTuple(average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)`).\n2. Calculate the average temperature using the `mean()` function from the Statistics package. You can also use the `Statistics.mean()` function if you prefer to avoid namespace conflicts with the base mean() function.\n3. Find the maximum and minimum temperatures by iterating through the list (using a for loop). Alternatively, you can use the `maximum()` and `minimum()` functions from Base.\n4. To determine the trend, iterate through the temperature data comparing adjacent values and keeping track of the direction. If the first element is greater than the second, set `trend = :increasing`. Similarly, if the first element is less than the second, set `trend = :decreasing`. Otherwise (if they are equal), set `trend = :stable`.\n5. After iterating through all values in the list, return a named tuple with the calculated average temperature, maximum and minimum temperatures, and the trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,260],"elapsed":13.944317023,"_type":"aimessage"}]
