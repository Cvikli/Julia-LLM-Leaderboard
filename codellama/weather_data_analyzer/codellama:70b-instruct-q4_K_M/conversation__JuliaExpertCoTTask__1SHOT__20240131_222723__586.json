Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Julia provides an excellent library for statistical analysis through the Statistics package.

If so, we return a named tuple with all values set to nothing as per your problem statement.\n* If the list is not empty, we calculate the average temperature using the mean function from the Statistics package and round it to two decimal places for better presentation.\n* We then find the maximum and minimum temperatures in `temps` using the Base functions maximum() and minimum().\n* Finally, we determine the trend by comparing the first and last elements of the list. Depending on whether they are greater than or less than each other, we set the value of `trend`. If they are equal, then we set it to `:stable`.\n* We return a named tuple with all computed values for `average`, `max`, `min` and `trend`.","status":200,"tokens":[305,578],"elapsed":74.189026925,"_type":"aimessage"}]
