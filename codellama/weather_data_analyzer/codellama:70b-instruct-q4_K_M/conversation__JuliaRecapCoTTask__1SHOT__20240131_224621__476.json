[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers).

The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`).

As a responsible AI language model, I will provide you with the necessary steps and guidance to help you solve this problem. Here's what you need to do:\n\n1. Import the `Statistics` package at the top of your code using `using Statistics`. This allows us to access statistical functions like mean(), median(), std() etc.\n2. Define a function called `weather_data_analyzer` that takes in a list of daily temperature data (numbers). Inside this function:\n\t* Check if the list is empty, and if it is, return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. You can use an `if-else` statement for this.\n\t* If the list is not empty, calculate the average using `mean(temps)`, max using `maximum(temps)`, min using `minimum(temps)`, and trend by comparing adjacent temperatures in a loop or using a comprehension like `[i < j ? :increasing : i > j ? :decreasing : :stable for (i,j) in zip(temps[1:end-1], temps[2:end])]`.\n\t* Return the results as a named tuple. You can use something like `(; average=mean_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend_result)` to construct the tuple.\n3. Make sure to handle any possible edge cases or errors that might occur in your function (e.g., empty list of temperatures).\n4. Test your function by calling it with different temperature lists and checking if the results are correct.\n\nNow, you have all the necessary steps to solve this problem.
