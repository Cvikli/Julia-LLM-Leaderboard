[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers).

Please note that it makes use of Julia's built-in Statistics package, and it assumes that the input data is in the form of a list of numbers (i.e., Int64 or Float64).\n```julia\nusing Statistics # For statistical analysis functions\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Check if temps is empty\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    # Calculate statistics and trend\n    average = mean(temps)\n    maximum = maximum(temps)\n    minimum = minimum(temps)\n\n    if length(temps) == 1\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif temps[end] > temps[end-1]\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif temps[end] < temps[end-1]\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    # Return results in a named tuple\n    return (; average=average, max=maximum, min=minimum, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis code defines the function `weather_data_analyzer` that takes as input a list of temperatures (`temps`) and returns a named tuple containing statistical information such as average temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and trend. If the length of `temps` is 0 (i.e., the list is empty), it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the mean, maximum, minimum, and trend using functions from the Statistics package. Finally, it returns a named tuple containing these statistical results.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the input data will be a list of numbers (i.e., Int64 or Float64). If you want to allow for other types of data as input, you may need to modify the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[462,449],"elapsed":25.232115785,"_type":"aimessage"}]
