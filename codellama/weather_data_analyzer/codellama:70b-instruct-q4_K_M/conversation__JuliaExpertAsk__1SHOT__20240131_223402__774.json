Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In order to solve this problem, we need to use the Statistics package and its functions. We'll also use NamedTuple in Julia. Let's break down the code into steps. Here is the function that performs statistical analyses on daily temperature data:\n```julia-repl\nusing Statistics  # Load Statistics module for statistics functions\n\n# Define a function named weather_data_analyzer which takes an argument temps of type Vector{Int}\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{Float64})\n    if length(temps) == 0  # If the input list is empty, return a named tuple with all values set to nothing.\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing);\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)  # Calculate and store the average temperature from temps using Statistics package's mean function.\n    maximum = maximum(temps)  # Calculate and store the maximum temperature from temps using Statistics package's maximum function.\n    minimum = minimum(temps)  # Calculate and store the minimum temperature from temps using Statistics package's minimum function.\n\n    if length(temps) == 1  # If there is only one value in temps, it means that the trend will be :stable since it can't change over time with only a single data point.\n        return (average=average, max=maximum, min=minimum, trend=:stable);\n    end\n\n    # Check if the first element of temps is less than or equal to the last element\n    if temps[1] <= temps[end]\n        trend = :increasing  # If so, it means that the temperature has increased over time. So set the trend to :increasing\n    elseif temps[1] > temps[end]\n        trend = :decreasing  # If not, then the temperature has decreased over time. So set the trend to :decreasing\n    end\n\n    return (average=average, max=maximum, min=minimum, trend=trend);  # Return a named tuple with calculated results\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the `temps` list is empty. If it's not, it calculates and stores the average, maximum, minimum, and trend based on the values in the `temps` list. It then returns a named tuple containing these values. If the `temps` list is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,564],"elapsed":30.42447548,"_type":"aimessage"}]
