[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`).

If there are no data points in the list, all values will be set to nothing. Here's how I would write this function:\n```julia-repl\nusing Statistics  # Importing the Statistics package for calculations\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Array{Int64})\n    if isempty(temps)  # Check if there are no temperatures provided\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    average = mean(temps)  # Calculate the average temperature\n    max = maximum(temps)   # Find the maximum temperature\n    min = minimum(temps)   # Find the minimum temperature\n    if temps[1] < temps[end]\n        trend = :increasing  # If the first temperature is lower than the last, it's an increasing trend\n    elseif temps[1] > temps[end]\n        trend = :decreasing  # If the first temperature is higher than the last, it's a decreasing trend\n    else\n        trend = :stable  # Otherwise, the temperatures are stable\n    end\n    return (average=average, max=max, min=min, trend=trend)  # Return a named tuple with the calculated values\nend\n```\n\nNote: This function assumes that `temps` is an array of integers. If it's possible for temperatures to be floating-point numbers or have other data types, you may want to adjust the type declaration in the function definition (`temps::Array{Int64}`).","status":200,"tokens":[471,389],"elapsed":21.658309894,"_type":"aimessage"}]
