It then iterates over each line and checks if it starts with either \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If it does, it extracts the question or answer from the current line and stores it in a variable. Finally, the function returns the question and answer in a tuple.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that there is only one question and answer in the markdown text, and that they are separated by a blank line between them. If there are multiple questions and answers or if they are not separated by a blank line, the function may not work correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,371],"elapsed":3.091133816,"_type":"aimessage"}]
