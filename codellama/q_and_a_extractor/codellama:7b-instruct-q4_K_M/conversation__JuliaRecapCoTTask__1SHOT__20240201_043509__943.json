[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"It sounds like you want to extract information from a markdown-formatted text file that contains sections with headers `# Question` and `# Answer`. You want to return a tuple with the question and answer, stripped of any leading spaces or newlines.\n\nTo achieve this, I would suggest using the `Markdown.parse` function from the `Markdown` package to parse the markdown text into an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree). The AST can then be traversed to extract the information you need.\n\nHere is some sample code that demonstrates how you could do this:\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Parse the markdown text into an AST\n    ast = Markdown.parse(md)\n    \n    # Extract the question and answer sections\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    for element in ast.children\n        if element.type == \"header\" && element.level == 2\n            # Check if this is a question or answer section\n            if element.text == \"# Question\"\n                question = element.next.text\n            elseif element.text == \"# Answer\"\n                answer = element.next.text\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Return the extracted information as a tuple\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function takes in a markdown text string `md` and returns a tuple with the question and answer sections of the text. The function first parses the markdown text into an AST using the `Markdown.parse` function. It then traverses the AST to extract the information you need.\n\nThe `element.type == \"header\"` check ensures that only headers with level 2 are considered (i.e., `# Question` and `# Answer`). The `element.level == 2` check ensures that only headers with level 2 are considered, which should be the case for your markdown text format.\n\nThe `if element.text == \"# Question\"` and `if element.text == \"# Answer\"` checks ensure that only the relevant sections are considered. The `.next` property of an AST element returns the next sibling element in the tree, which is what we want to access for the question or answer section text.\n\nFinally, the function returns a tuple with the extracted information.","status":200,"tokens":[0,520],"elapsed":4.48802109,"_type":"aimessage"}]
