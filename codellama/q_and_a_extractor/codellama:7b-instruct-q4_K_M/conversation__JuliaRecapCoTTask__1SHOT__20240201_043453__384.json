[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The given text is a markdown-formatted text `md`. To extract the question and answer sections, we can use regular expressions to search for lines starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively. We can then extract the content of each section by removing any leading spaces or newlines using `strip()`.\n\nHere's an example implementation:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    # Search for lines starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`\n    pattern = r\"#\\s*Question\\s*\"\n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        if occursin(pattern, line)\n            question = strip(replace(line, pattern => \"\"))\n        end\n    end\n    # Search for lines starting with `# Answer`\n    pattern = r\"#\\s*Answer\\s*\"\n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        if occursin(pattern, line)\n            answer = strip(replace(line, pattern => \"\"))\n        end\n    end\n    # Return the question and answer as a tuple\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nNote that this implementation assumes that each section starts with a line containing only `# Question` or `# Answer`, followed by the content of the section. If the format is not consistent, the function may produce incorrect results.","status":200,"tokens":[0,312],"elapsed":2.66776458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
