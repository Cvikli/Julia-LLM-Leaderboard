[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of `q_and_a_extractor` using Julia's standard libraries:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    # Extract the question and answer sections from the markdown text\n    question, answer = map(strip, split(md, \"# Answer\"))\n    \n    # Return the answer as a tuple\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis implementation uses Julia's `split` function to split the input string `md` into two parts: the part before the first occurrence of `# Answer`, and the part after it. The `strip` function is then applied to both parts to remove any leading spaces or newlines. Finally, the resulting two strings are returned as a tuple.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that there is only one `# Question` section in the input text, and that it appears before the first `# Answer` section. If there are multiple `# Question` sections or if they appear after `# Answer`, the function may not work correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,225],"elapsed":1.922297512,"_type":"aimessage"}]
