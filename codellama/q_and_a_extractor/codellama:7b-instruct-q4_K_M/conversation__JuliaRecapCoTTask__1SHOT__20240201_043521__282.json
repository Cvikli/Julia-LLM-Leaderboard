[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To extract all the text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`, we can use Julia's `Markdown.parse` function to parse the input string as a Markdown document, and then iterate over the elements of the resulting `MD` object to extract the text from each section.\n\nHere is an example implementation:\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Parse the input string as a Markdown document\n    doc = Markdown.parse(md)\n\n    # Extract the text from each section and strip any leading spaces and newlines\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    for element in doc.content\n        if isa(element, MD.Header) && startswith(string(element), \"# Question\")\n            question = strip(join(element.content))\n        elseif isa(element, MD.Header) && startswith(string(element), \"# Answer\")\n            answer = strip(join(element.content))\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `Markdown.parse` function to parse the input string as a Markdown document, and then iterates over the elements of the resulting `MD` object using a `for` loop. For each element, it checks if it is a header (`MD.Header`) and if its contents start with either \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If it is, it extracts the text from that section by joining the contents of the header and stripping any leading spaces and newlines using `strip`.\n\nThe function then returns the extracted question and answer as a tuple.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that there will only be one `# Question` and one `# Answer` section in the input string, and that these sections will be the first and second elements of the `doc.content` array, respectively. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the code to account for additional or missing sections.","status":200,"tokens":[0,460],"elapsed":3.950306305,"_type":"aimessage"}]
