[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the `q_and_a_extractor` function:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    # Extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer\n    question, answer = [], []\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question = strip(line[9:end])\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer = strip(line[8:end])\n        end\n    end\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function iterates over the lines of the input markdown text and checks whether each line starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`. If it does, it extracts the relevant text from the line and stores it in a tuple. Finally, it returns the tuple containing the question and answer.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the questions and answers are separated by a single blank line, as is the case in the example provided. If your markdown file uses different separators or has other formatting issues, you may need to modify the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[399,250],"elapsed":2.195138564,"_type":"aimessage"}]
