[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Let's break down the problem into smaller steps:\n\n1. Parse the markdown text to extract the sections Question and Answer.\n2. Extract the text inside the `# Question` and `# Answer` tags.\n3. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n4. Return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.\n\nTo parse the markdown text, we can use the `Markdown.parse` function from the `Markdown` package. This function takes a string argument and returns an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the parsed markdown document. We can then traverse the AST to extract the sections Question and Answer.\n\nHere's some sample code to get started:\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\n# Parse the markdown text\nast = Markdown.parse(md)\n\n# Extract the text inside the # Question and # Answer tags\nquestion = ast[1].content[2]\nanswer = ast[1].content[4]\n\n# Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text\nquestion = replace(strip(question), r\"^\\s+\", \"\")\nanswer = replace(strip(answer), r\"^\\s+\", \"\")\n\n# Return the answer in a tuple like (question,answer)\nreturn (question, answer)\n```\nNote that this code assumes that the markdown text is stored in a variable `md` and that the sections Question and Answer are located at the first level of the AST. If your markdown text has a different structure or contains multiple levels of nesting, you may need to modify the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,354],"elapsed":3.030535755,"_type":"aimessage"}]
