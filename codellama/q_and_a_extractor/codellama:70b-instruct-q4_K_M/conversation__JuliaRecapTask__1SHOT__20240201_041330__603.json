[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The task is to extract the text of the question and answer sections from a Markdown-formatted text using Julia. The text consists of sections with headings that start with `#`. Each section begins with `# Question` or `# Answer`, followed by the content of the section. The desired output is a tuple containing the question text as the first element and the answer text as the second element.\n\n  Here's an example function to solve this problem:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Define regular expression patterns for matching section headers\n    question_re = r\"^\\#\\s*Question:(?P<question>.*)\"ms\n    answer_re   = r\"^\\#\\s*Answer:\\s+(?P<answer>.*)\"ms\n\n    # Match the sections and extract their text\n    question_match = match(question_re, md)\n    answer_match   = match(answer_re, md)\n\n    if isnothing(question_match) || isnothing(answer_match)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"No Question or Answer section found in the markdown text.\"))\n    end\n\n    # Strip leading spaces and newlines from extracted text\n    question = strip(question_match[\"question\"])\n    answer   = strip(answer_match[\"answer\"])\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n  Here's a description of the code:\n* The function `q_and_a_extractor` takes a markdown-formatted text as input and returns a tuple containing the question and answer sections.\n* Two regular expression patterns are defined to match section headers (`question_re`, `answer_re`). Each pattern captures the remaining text of the section in a named capture group (`?P<name>...`) for easy extraction. The `m` flag enables multi-line mode, and the `s` flag allows `.*` to also match newlines.\n* The sections are matched using the `match` function, which returns a `RegexMatch` object or `nothing` if no match is found.\n* If both matches succeed (`isnothing(question_match) || isnothing(answer_match)`), the text of each section is extracted by accessing the named capture groups (`[\"name\"]`). The leading spaces and newlines are stripped using the `strip` function.\n* Finally, a tuple containing the question and answer sections is returned as the output.","status":200,"tokens":[413,540],"elapsed":70.889149636,"_type":"aimessage"}]
