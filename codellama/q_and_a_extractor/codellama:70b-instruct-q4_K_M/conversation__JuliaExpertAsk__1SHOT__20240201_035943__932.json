It splits the input text into sections and loops through them. If it finds a section that starts with \"Question\" or \"Answer,\" it extracts the text and returns it in a tuple as `(question, answer)`. The extracted text is stripped of any leading spaces and newlines using regular expressions.","status":200,"tokens":[0,409],"elapsed":21.968793491,"_type":"aimessage"}]
