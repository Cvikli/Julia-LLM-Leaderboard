X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

We can use a combination of these methods for a robust solution that meets your task requirements and special instructions. Here is one possible approach:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Parse the markdown string to extract sections\n    md_sections = parse(Markdown.MD, md).content\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    \n    for section in md_sections\n        if section isa Markdown.Header && strip(section.text) == \"Question\"\n            question = strip_leading_newlines(strip_leading_spaces(string(Markdown.plain(md_sections[section.level + 1]))))\n            \n        elseif section isa Markdown.Header && strip(section.text) == \"Answer\"\n            answer = strip_leading_newlines(strip_leading_spaces(string(Markdown.plain(md_sections[section.level + 1]))))\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n\n# Function to remove leading spaces and newlines from a string\nfunction strip_leading_spaces(str::AbstractString)\n    stripped_str = \"\"\n    \n    for char in str\n        if char != ' ' && char != '\\n'\n            stripped_str *= char\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return stripped_str\nend\n\n# Function to remove leading newlines from a string\nfunction strip_leading_newlines(str::AbstractString)\n    stripped_str = \"\"\n    \n    for char in str\n        if char != '\\n'\n            stripped_str *= char\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return stripped_str\nend\n```\n\nThis function first parses the markdown string using `Markdown.parse`. Then, it iterates through each section in the parsed content and checks if a header is found with \"Question\" or \"Answer\" as its text. If a match is found, it extracts the subsequent section content using `Markdown.plain` to convert it into plaintext.\n\nThe extracted content is then cleaned up by stripping leading spaces and newlines using helper functions `strip_leading_spaces` and `strip_leading_newlines`. These functions iterate through each character in the string and remove any leading spaces or newlines until a non-whitespace character is found.\n\nFinally, it returns a tuple containing the question and answer text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,580],"elapsed":31.692476963,"_type":"aimessage"}]
