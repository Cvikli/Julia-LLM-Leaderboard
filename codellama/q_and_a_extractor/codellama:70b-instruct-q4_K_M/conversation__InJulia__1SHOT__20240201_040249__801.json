Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

This assumes that all question and answer sections are correctly formatted in the input file with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively, as the section headings. It also assumes that each question-answer pair appears consecutively within the markdown file (i.e., there is no intervening text between them).\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the input string on newlines to get individual lines.\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n\n    question_section_started = false  # Flag to indicate whether a question section has started.\n    answer_section_started = false   # Flag to indicate whether an answer section has started.\n\n    question = \"\"      # String to store the current question text.\n    answer = \"\"        # String to store the current answer text.\n\n    for line in lines  # Iterate over each line of the input markdown string.\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question_section_started = true   # Set flag indicating that a new question section has started.\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer_section_started = true     # Set flag indicating that a new answer section has started.\n        end\n\n        if question_section_started && !answer_section_started  # If we are within the Question section...\n            line = strip(line)    # Strip leading spaces and newlines from the line.\n            if startswith(line, \"#\")  # Ignore any lines starting with '#' (i.e., section headings).\n                continue\n            end\n            \n            question *= line   # Append the current line to the question string.\n        elseif answer_section_started && !question_section_started  # If we are within the Answer section...\n            line = strip(line)    # Strip leading spaces and newlines from the line.\n            if startswith(line, \"#\")  # Ignore any lines starting with '#' (i.e., section headings).\n                continue\n            end\n            \n            answer *= line     # Append the current line to the answer string.\n        elseif !question_section_started && !answer_section_started   # If we are not within either a question or an answer section...\n            continue           # Skip this line and move on.\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)  # Return the extracted question-and-answer pair as a tuple.\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a single argument `md`, which is a string containing the markdown text to be processed. It then iterates over each line of the input, looking for lines that start with `# Question` or `# Answer`. When it finds these lines, it sets internal flags to indicate when a question section has started and when an answer section has started.\n\nWithin each section, it ignores any lines starting with '#' (i.e., section headings) and concatenates the remaining text into the appropriate string variable (`question` or `answer`). It then returns the extracted pair of strings as a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes a specific formatting of the input markdown file; if your input does not conform to these assumptions (e.g., if there are intervening text sections between question-and-answer pairs), it may not work correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,781],"elapsed":42.120671445,"_type":"aimessage"}]
