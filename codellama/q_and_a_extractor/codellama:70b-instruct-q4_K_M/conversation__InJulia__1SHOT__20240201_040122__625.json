It has built-in support for multidimensional arrays, arbitrary precision numbers, and functions that operate on these.\"\"\"\n\n(question, answer) = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\n```\n\nThis function will return a tuple `(q,a)` where `q` is the question text and `a` is the corresponding answer. The text between `# Question` and `# Answer` sections is extracted using regular expressions to match the desired format. Any leading spaces or newlines are stripped from the extracted text before returning it in a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,431],"elapsed":23.315188799,"_type":"aimessage"}]
