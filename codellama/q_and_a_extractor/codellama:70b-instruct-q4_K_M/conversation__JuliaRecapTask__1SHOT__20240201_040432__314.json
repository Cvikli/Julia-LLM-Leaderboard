[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Here's an example implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Split the markdown text into lines based on newline character\n    md_lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Initialize empty variables to store question and answer\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    # Iterate through each line in the markdown text\n    for (line_index, line) in enumerate(md_lines)\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            # Start of the question section\n            \n            # Initialize a variable to store current line index\n            current_index = line_index + 1\n            \n            # Iterate through each line starting from the next line until we reach the answer section\n            while !startswith(md_lines[current_index], \"# Answer\")\n                question *= md_lines[current_index]\n                \n                current_index += 1\n            end\n            \n            # Strip any leading and trailing spaces from the question string\n            question = strip(question)\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            # Start of the answer section\n            \n            # Initialize a variable to store current line index\n            current_index = line_index + 1\n            \n            # Iterate through each line starting from the next line until we reach the end of markdown text\n            while current_index <= length(md_lines) && !startswith(md_lines[current_index], \"# Question\")\n                answer *= md_lines[current_index]\n                \n                current_index += 1\n            end\n            \n            # Strip any leading and trailing spaces from the answer string\n            answer = strip(answer)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first splits the markdown text into lines based on newline character. It then iterates through each line and checks if it starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`. If it finds a question section, it concatenates all subsequent lines until it reaches the answer section. Similarly, for an answer section, it concatenates all subsequent lines until it reaches the end of markdown text or another question section. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer as strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,565],"elapsed":30.721671321,"_type":"aimessage"}]
