If no match is found, it returns `(nothing, nothing)`. Otherwise, it uses `replace` to remove any leading spaces from the captured question text. \n\nSimilarly, it attempts to extract the answer text with another regex pattern.

Finally, the function returns a tuple of `(question, answer)`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,320],"elapsed":17.255509607,"_type":"aimessage"}]
