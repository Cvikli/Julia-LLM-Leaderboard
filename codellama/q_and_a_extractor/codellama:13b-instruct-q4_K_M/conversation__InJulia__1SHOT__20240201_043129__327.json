Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

It loops through each element in the markdown content and checks if it is a header with the text \"Question\" or \"Answer\". If it is a header, it extracts the text after the header and adds it to the appropriate list. Finally, it returns a tuple of the questions and answers.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n```julia\nmd_text = \"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n\\n# Answer\\nParis\"\nquestions, answers = q_and_a_extractor(Markdown.parse(md_text))\nprintln(\"Question: $question\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $answer\")\n```\nThis would output:\n```julia\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: Paris\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,335],"elapsed":4.460134204,"_type":"aimessage"}]
