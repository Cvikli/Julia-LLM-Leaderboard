It then iterates over each line in the split string and checks if it starts with either \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If a line starts with \"# Question\", it extracts the question text by stripping any leading spaces and newlines from the line. If a line starts with \"# Answer\", it extracts the answer text by stripping any leading spaces and newlines from the line, and then breaks out of the loop to avoid extracting any more lines that start with \"# Answer\". Finally, it returns a tuple containing both the question and answer texts.","status":200,"tokens":[0,251],"elapsed":3.315906723,"_type":"aimessage"}]
