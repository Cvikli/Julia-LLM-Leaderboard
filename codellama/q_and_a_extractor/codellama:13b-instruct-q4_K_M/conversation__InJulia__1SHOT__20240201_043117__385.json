The `strip_leading_spaces_and_newlines` function is used to remove any leading spaces or newlines from the extracted text.\n\nTo use this function, you would call it with the markdown text as an argument, like this:\n```julia\nmd = \"# Question\\nWhat is the meaning of life?\\n# Answer\\nThe meaning of life is to find your purpose and live a fulfilling life.\"\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: $question\") # Output: \"What is the meaning of life?\"\nprintln(\"Answer: $answer\")     # Output: \"The meaning of life is to find your purpose and live a fulfilling life.\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,498],"elapsed":6.636540763,"_type":"aimessage"}]
