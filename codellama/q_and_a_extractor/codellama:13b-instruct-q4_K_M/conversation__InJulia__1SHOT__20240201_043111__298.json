Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

The function first splits the input string into lines using the `\\n` character, then it iterates over each line and checks if it starts with \"# Question:\" or \"# Answer:\". If either of these conditions is true, it extracts the text after the colon and assigns it to the corresponding variable (question or answer). Finally, it returns a tuple containing the question and answer.\n\nNote that this function assumes that each markdown section (Question and Answer) starts on its own line and ends with a newline character (`\\n`). If your input string does not follow this convention, you may need to modify the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,276],"elapsed":3.663806952,"_type":"aimessage"}]
