[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

One of them is `Markdown`. Here's a solution using this library:\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Parse the markdown file\n    doc = parse_markdown(md)\n    \n    # Extract the question and answer sections\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    for block in doc.content\n        if block.name == \"Question\" && block.type == \"header\"\n            question = strip_spaces(block.text)\n        elseif block.name == \"Answer\" && block.type == \"header\"\n            answer = strip_spaces(block.text)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Return the extracted text as a tuple\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n\n# Strip leading spaces and newlines from a string\nfunction strip_spaces(str::String)\n    return replace(str, r\"^[\\n\\s]+\", \"\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `Markdown` library to parse the markdown file and extract the question and answer sections. It then strips any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text using a regular expression. Finally, it returns the extracted text as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,296],"elapsed":4.15268651,"_type":"aimessage"}]
