[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could implement the `q_and_a_extractor` function:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Initialize empty question and answer variables\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    # Iterate through each line in the markdown text\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question: \")\n            # Extract the question from the line\n            question = strip(split(line)[2])\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer: \")\n            # Extract the answer from the line\n            answer = strip(split(line)[2])\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return a tuple of the extracted question and answer\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `startswith` function to check if a given line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If it does, it extracts the text after that header using the `strip` function. Finally, it returns a tuple of the extracted question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,246],"elapsed":3.255047087,"_type":"aimessage"}]
