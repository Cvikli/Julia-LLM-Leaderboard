[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n2. Solve the Task\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nTo solve this task, we can use a combination of regular expressions and string manipulation functions in Julia. We will start by defining a function `q_and_a_extractor` that takes a string `md` as input, which contains markdown-formatted text. The function will then extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.\n\nFirst, we need to define a regular expression that can match the start of each section. We will use a positive lookahead assertion `(?=#)` to match the start of each line that starts with \"#\" (i.e., the start of each markdown section). Then, we will use a capturing group `(^[^\\n]+\\n)(.*?)(?=\\n#|$)` to capture the text between the start of each section and the next section or end of file.\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    # define regular expression for matching markdown sections\n    re = r\"(?=#)(^[^\\n]+\\n)(.*?)(?=\\n#|$)\"\n    \n    # extract question and answer text using regular expressions\n    match = eachmatch(re, md)\n    questions = [m.captures[1] for m in match]\n    answers = [strip(m.captures[2]) for m in match]\n    \n    # return tuple of question and answer\n    return (questions, answers)\nend\n```\nNext, we can test the function on some example input:\n```julia\n# define example markdown text\nmd = \"# Question 1\\nThis is a sample question.\\n\\n# Answer 1\\nThis is a sample answer.\"\n\n# call function to extract question and answer\nq_and_a_extractor(md)\n```\nThe output should be:\n```julia\n(\"Question 1\", \"This is a sample answer.\")\n```\nWe can also use the `strip` function to remove any leading spaces or newlines from the extracted text. This will make the output more readable and easier to work with in other parts of our program.","status":200,"tokens":[0,540],"elapsed":7.641211901,"_type":"aimessage"}]
