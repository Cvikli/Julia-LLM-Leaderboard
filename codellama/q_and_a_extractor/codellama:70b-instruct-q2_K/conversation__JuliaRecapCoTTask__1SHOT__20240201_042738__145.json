[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"1. **Import Julia Markdown Library**\n    In order to work with markdown-formatted text, import the relevant libraries and functions. Use the `import` or `using` keywords in Julia:\n```julia\n# Import Markdown library\nusing Markdown\n```\n2. **Define a Function**\n    Define a function called `q_and_a_extractor` with one parameter, `md`, which will contain the markdown-formatted text to parse. Use Julia's standard function definition syntax:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n  # Function body\nend\n```\n3. **Split Markdown into Sections**\n    To extract the question and answer from the markdown, split it into sections based on the `# Question` and `# Answer` headings. Use Julia's `split` function to do so:\n```julia\nsections = split(md, \"---\\n\") # Split by ---\n```\n4. **Extract Question Text**\n    The first section contains the question text, which starts with `# Question`. Use a regex to capture this part of the text and store it in `question`:\n```julia\nquestion_section = sections[1]\nmatch = match(r\"^#\\s+Question(?:\\n|.)+$\", question_section) # Match section starting from \"# Question\"\nquestion = match.match # Extracted question text\n```\n5. **Extract Answer Text**\n    Similarly, extract the answer text from the second section:\n```julia\nanswer_section = sections[2]\nmatch = match(r\"^#\\s+Answer(?:\\n|.)+$\", answer_section) # Match section starting from \"# Answer\"\nanswer = match.match # Extracted answer text\n```\n6. **Return a Tuple**\n    Finally, return the extracted question and answer as a tuple `(question, answer)`:\n```julia\nreturn (question, answer)\n```\n7. **Strip Leading Spaces and Newlines**\n    To satisfy the Special Instructions, you should strip leading spaces and newlines from both the question and answer text. Use Julia's `strip` function to do so:\n```julia\nreturn (strip(question), strip(answer))\n```\n8. **Testing the Function**\n    You can now test your function by calling it with a sample markdown-formatted string and checking that the extracted text matches the expected result.\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"---\n# Question\nHere is a question...\n---\n# Answer\nAnd here is the answer!\"\"\"\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md)\n@test result == (\"# Question\\nHere is a question...\", \"# Answer\\nAnd here is the answer!\")\n```\n9. **Additional Special Instructions**\n    If any other special instructions are provided, adjust your function accordingly. For example, if the user requests using `rstrip` instead of `strip`, replace the relevant section in the code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,682],"elapsed":28.310309628,"_type":"aimessage"}]
