Split the markdown-formatted text by lines using `#` as delimiter. This will give you an array of strings, each representing one line in the original text.\n3. Loop over the resulting array of strings to find where the question and answer are located:\n```julia\nfor (i,line) in enumerate(lines_md)\n    if occursin(\"Question\", line)\n        # Code here\n    elseif occursin(\"Answer\", line)\n        # Code here\n    end\nend\n```\n4. If the current `line` contains `# Question`, extract all text starting from the next line to the first occurrence of a new section (i.e., another hash mark `#`). This will be your question:\n```julia\nif occursin(\"# Question\", line)\n    start = i + 1 # Start index for extracting the question text\n    end_index = findnext(x -> x[1] == '#', enumerate(lines_md), start=start) - 1 # End index for extracting the question text (end of file if not found)\n    question = join(strip.(lines_md[(start):end_index]), \"\\n\") # Join all lines into a single string, stripping any leading or trailing spaces.\n```\n5. If the current `line` contains `# Answer`, extract all text starting from the next line to the first occurrence of a new section (i.e., another hash mark `#`).

Return the question and answer in a tuple:\n```julia\nreturn (question=question, answer=answer)\n```\n7. Check that you've successfully extracted the question and answer by printing it to the console using `println`.","status":200,"tokens":[137,526],"elapsed":21.942379553,"_type":"aimessage"}]
