[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

If this assumption is not met, then you may want to adjust the regex. Additionally, it does not check if there are multiple questions or answers in the same string; it simply returns the last occurrence of each.","status":200,"tokens":[0,261],"elapsed":10.607083886,"_type":"aimessage"}]
