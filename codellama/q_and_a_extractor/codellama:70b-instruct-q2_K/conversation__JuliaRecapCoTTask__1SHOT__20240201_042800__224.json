[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

Identify sections of text with the section heading `# Question` and `# Answer`. \n2. Extract all text after the section heading, stripping any leading spaces or newlines.\n3. Return a tuple containing the question and answer strings in the order (question,answer). \n4. If no Question/Answer sections are found, return an empty string for each component of the tuple. \n5. If there is no `# Answer` section but only a `# Question`, return the extracted text for the question with an empty string for the answer. \n6. If there are multiple instances of Questions and Answers in the document, extract all pairs as tuples in an array-like structure or list. \n7. Ensure that your function is able to handle any edge cases or unexpected input, returning empty strings when necessary.\n8. Remember to follow good coding practices and ensure readability and maintainability of your code. \n9. Make use of built-in functions and language features in Julia to simplify the solution process. \n10. If you're unsure about something or need clarification, feel free to ask for guidance. \n11. You may also want to include comments in your code to make it easier to understand and follow. \n12. Finally, ensure that your function is scalable and can handle large amounts of text input efficiently. \n\nPlease note that these are only general guidelines, and you should prioritize the specific Special Instructions provided if any.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further guidance on completing this task, feel free to ask!
