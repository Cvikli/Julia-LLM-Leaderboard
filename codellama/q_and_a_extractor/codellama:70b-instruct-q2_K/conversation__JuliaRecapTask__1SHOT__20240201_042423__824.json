[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Let's focus on solving this task together! Here's my proposed solution:\n\n```julia\n# Function Definition\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the Markdown Text into Lines and Strip Leading Whitespaces\n    lines = split(strip(md), \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Initialize Question and Answer Variables for Extraction\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    # Iterate through the Markdown File Lines\n    for i in 1:length(lines)\n        if startswith(lines[i], \"# Question \") && length(question) == 0\n            # Identify and Extract Question Text from Markdown (if not empty)\n            question = strip(split(lines[i+2]) |> join);\n            \n        elseif startswith(lines[i], \"# Answer \") && length(answer) == 0\n            # Identify and Extract Answer Text from Markdown (if not empty)\n            answer = strip(split(lines[i+2]) |> join);\n        \n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Return the Question and Answer in a Tuple\n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `q_and_a_extractor` that takes as input a Markdown-formatted text (`md`), splits it into lines, iterates through these lines, and extracts the questions and answers from the specified sections. \n\nIt starts by initializing empty variables for `question` and `answer`. Then, it iterates over the lines of the input Markdown text. Whenever a line begins with `# Question`, it assigns the text that follows to the question variable. Similarly, when a line begins with `# Answer`, it assigns the text that follows to the answer variable. Finally, it returns the extracted question and answer in a tuple.\n\nThis function assumes that the sections are marked with `# Question` and `# Answer`, followed by the actual text on the next line, as indicated in the task description. It does not perform any additional processing of the extracted text, such as parsing or formatting, but only returns it as-is.","status":200,"tokens":[406,511],"elapsed":21.869102779,"_type":"aimessage"}]
