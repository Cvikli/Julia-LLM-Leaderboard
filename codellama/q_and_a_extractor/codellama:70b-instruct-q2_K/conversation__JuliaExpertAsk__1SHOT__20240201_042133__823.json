The code assumes that each question starts with `# Question` in its own line and the answer immediately follows it, starting with `# Answer` in its own line.\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)::Tuple{String, String}\n    pattern = r\"^# Question\\n(.*?)\\n+# Answer\\n(.*?)(?=\\n|\\z)\"m\n    matches = match(pattern, md)\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    if matches !== nothing && matches.captures[1] !== nothing && matches.captures[2] !== nothing\n        # Remove leading spaces and newlines from extracted text\n        question = strip(matches.captures[1])\n        answer = strip(matches.captures[2])\n    end\n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nThe `q_and_a_extractor` function takes a markdown-formatted string as input and uses the Regex library to extract question and answer pairs from the text. It returns these pairs in a tuple. If no matches are found for the pattern, it will return an empty tuple ((\"\",\"\")). The Regex pattern finds all lines that start with `# Question`, captures all characters until the next occurrence of `# Answer`, then captures all characters up to the end or the next newline character.\nThe `strip` function is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text. If you want to keep these, just assign the captured strings directly without using the `strip` function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,362],"elapsed":14.752980727,"_type":"aimessage"}]
