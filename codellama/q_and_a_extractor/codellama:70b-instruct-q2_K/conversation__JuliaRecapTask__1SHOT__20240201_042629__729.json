[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is my attempt to solve this problem step-by-step:\n\n1. Create a function that takes in the markdown-formatted text `md` as input.\n2. Iterate over each line of the text, and extract all text between `# Question` and `# Answer`. These are your question and answer sections.\n3. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from both extracted texts using a regular expression or built-in functions in Julia.\n4. Return a tuple containing `(question, answer)`.\n\nHere is an example implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Find the question and answer sections\n    match = r\"^# Question\\n+([\\s\\S]*?)\\n*^# Answer\\n+([\\s\\S]*)\"im\n    result = match(md)\n    if result === nothing\n        return nothing\n    end\n    \n    # Extract the question and answer from the matched text.\n    q, a = result[1], result[2]\n    \n    # Strip any leading spaces and newlines.\n    q = replace(q, r\"^[\\n\\s]+\"m => \"\")\n    a = replace(a, r\"^[\\n\\s]+\"m => \"\")\n    \n    return (question=q, answer=a)\nend\n```\n\nIn this solution:\n\n* The function `q_and_a_extractor` takes in the markdown-formatted text as an input and returns a tuple of `(question,answer)`.\n* A regular expression is used to extract all text between `# Question` and `# Answer`. The `im` flags are set for case-insensitivity and multi-line matching.\n* The question and answer sections are extracted using the captured groups from the match result.\n* Leading spaces and newlines are stripped using a regular expression with the `m` flag for multiline matching.\n* A tuple is returned containing both the question and answer, as required.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that there is only one pair of `# Question` and `# Answer` sections in the input text. If multiple pairs are possible, a different approach would be needed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,492],"elapsed":20.400100913,"_type":"aimessage"}]
