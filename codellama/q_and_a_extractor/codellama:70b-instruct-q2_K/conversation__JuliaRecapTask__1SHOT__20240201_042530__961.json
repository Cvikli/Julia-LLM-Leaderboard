[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"1. Identify the sections of interest: \"Question\" and \"Answer\". \n2. Extract all texts under these two sections using regular expressions (regex). \n3. Strip leading spaces and newlines from extracted text by using string functions like `strip` or `lstrip`. \n4. Return a tuple with the question and answer, respectively.\n5. Make sure to handle cases where there is no question or answer section in the input markdown. \n6. Use Julia syntax and naming conventions for variables, functions, etc. \n7. Use simple logic and abstraction while coding to keep it clear and concise. \n\nHere's an example of how you might approach this task:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Extract text between \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\" using regex:\n    m = match(r\"#\\s+Question(.*?)#\\s+Answer\", md, UInt8('m')).match\n    \n    # Strip leading spaces and newlines from extracted text:\n    q_a = strip(strip.(split(m, \"\\n\"), [' ', '\\n']))\n    \n    return (q_a[1], q_a[2])  # Return question & answer as a tuple.\nend\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `q_and_a_extractor` that takes a markdown-formatted string `md`. It uses regular expressions to extract text between the sections \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\". It strips leading spaces and newlines from extracted text using the `strip` function. Finally, it returns a tuple with the question and answer as its elements.\n\nPlease note that this is just an example approach. You may need to make modifications or adjustments based on specific requirements or constraints.","status":200,"tokens":[0,402],"elapsed":16.885593716,"_type":"aimessage"}]
