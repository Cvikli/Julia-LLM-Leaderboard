It first splits the markdown text into sections using `# ` as a delimiter. Then it iterates through each section, looking for the ones that start with `# Question` and `# Answer`. If found, the function strips any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text and returns it in a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,255],"elapsed":10.384181006,"_type":"aimessage"}]
