[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

We parse the Markdown text into an Abstract Syntax Tree using `Markdown.parse`. This allows us to navigate the structure of the document without relying on regular expressions or other string manipulation techniques.\n2. We iterate through each section of the AST, checking for header nodes with level 1 (i.e., `#`). If the text matches \"Question\" or \"Answer\", we extract and strip the corresponding content from the next node in the document tree.\n3. Finally, we return a tuple containing both the question and answer.\n\nPlease note that this solution relies on the [Markdown package](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Markdown.jl) to parse Markdown documents into ASTs. ðŸ˜Š","status":200,"tokens":[0,393],"elapsed":16.30118478,"_type":"aimessage"}]
