This function assumes that each question and answer section starts with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively, and are followed by a newline. It uses regular expressions to capture the relevant content between these tags. Here's a possible implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing RegexMatch\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = match(r\"# Question(.*?)(?=#|$)\", md, 1).match[2] |> strip\n    answer = match(r\"# Answer(.*?)(?=\\n*#|\\n*\\Z)\", md, 1).match[2] |> strip\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n# Answer\\nParis\"\nq_and_a_extractor(md)\n```\n\nThis will return `(question, answer)` as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[107,240],"elapsed":10.048637877,"_type":"aimessage"}]
