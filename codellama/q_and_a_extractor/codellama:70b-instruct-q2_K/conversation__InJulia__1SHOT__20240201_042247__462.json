Use `Regex()` to create the pattern for each section (e.g., `# Question`) and then extract the relevant sections using `match()`. Here's an example implementation that creates a function `q_and_a_extractor` to achieve this:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    q = match(r\"# Question(.*?)(?=#)\", md, RegexMatch).match  # Extract text between `# Question` and the next header\n    a = match(r\"# Answer(.*?)\", md, RegexMatch).match        # Extract text between `# Answer` and end of string\n    return (q,a)  # Return a tuple with question and answer\nend\n```\nThe `RegexMatch` option tells Julia to use lazy matching, which means that it will match the shortest possible string.\n\nThe function `q_and_a_extractor` takes in a markdown-formatted text (`md`) as input, extracts the relevant sections using regular expressions and returns them as a tuple `(question, answer)`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,256],"elapsed":10.394238802,"_type":"aimessage"}]
