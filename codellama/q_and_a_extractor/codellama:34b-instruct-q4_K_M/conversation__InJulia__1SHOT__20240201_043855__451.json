[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)::Tuple{String,String}\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        if startswith(strip(line), \"# Question\")\n            push!(questions, strip(line[10:end]))\n        elseif startswith(strip(line), \"# Answer\")\n            push!(answers, strip(line[9:end]))\n        end\n    end\n    return (join(questions, \"\\n\"), join(answers, \"\\n\"))\nend\n```\nThis function first creates two empty lists `questions` and `answers`. Then it iterates over each line in the markdown string `md`, using the `eachline` function to split the string into individual lines. For each line, it checks if it starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If it does, it adds the text after the hash symbol to the corresponding list (either `questions` or `answers`).\n\nFinally, the function joins the elements of both lists using the `\\n` character as a delimiter, and returns the resulting string as a tuple. The `join` function is used instead of `*` because it allows you to specify the delimiter character, which is important in this case since we want to join the lines with newlines rather than spaces.","status":200,"tokens":[0,297],"elapsed":8.255330967,"_type":"aimessage"}]
