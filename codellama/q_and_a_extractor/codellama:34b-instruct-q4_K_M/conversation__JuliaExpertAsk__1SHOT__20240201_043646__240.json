If it does, we strip any leading spaces and newlines from the line and push it into the corresponding list (`questions` for questions, `answers` for answers).\n* Finally, we return a tuple containing the two lists.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the markdown text is well-formed and follows the format you described in your question. If the input text contains any syntax errors or deviates from the expected format, the function may not work as intended.","status":200,"tokens":[0,349],"elapsed":9.716952822,"_type":"aimessage"}]
