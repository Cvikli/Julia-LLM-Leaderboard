We use the `re` module to search for patterns in the markdown text using the `re.findall()` function.\n2. The pattern we search for is `# Question` followed by any number of spaces and then the question text, which is captured in a group (the `(.*)` part). This is followed by any number of spaces and then the end of the line (`$`). Then we look for another occurrence of `# Answer` followed by any number of spaces and then the answer text, which is also captured in a group.\n3. We use `[match[1] for match in matches]` to extract the question and answer text from the matches. The `matches` variable contains all the matches found using the pattern, and we iterate over each match using list comprehension. For each match, we access the first capture group (which is the question text) using `match[1]`.\n4. We return a tuple of the extracted questions and answers using `[(question, answer) for question, answer in zip(*q_and_a_extractor(md))]`. The `zip()` function is used to transpose the list of questions and answers into a list of tuples.\n\nHere's an example input and output:\n```\n# Question 1\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer 1\nParis\n\n# Question 2\nWhat is the largest planet in our solar system?\n\n# Answer 2\nJupiter\n```\nOutput: `[('Question 1', 'Answer 1'), ('Question 2', 'Answer 2')]`","status":200,"tokens":[0,493],"elapsed":13.748789529,"_type":"aimessage"}]
