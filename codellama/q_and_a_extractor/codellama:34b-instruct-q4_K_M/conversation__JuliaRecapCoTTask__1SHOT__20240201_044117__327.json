Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this task, such as `String`, `Regex`, and `Markdown` libraries.\n2. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor(md)` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer using the `Markdown` library. Use regular expressions to match the section headers and capture the text between them.\n3. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text using the `strip()` function.\n4. Return the tuple `(question, answer)` with the extracted question and answer text.\n5. Double-check that the solution is correct by testing it on a sample markdown input.","status":200,"tokens":[0,561],"elapsed":15.870820408,"_type":"aimessage"}]
