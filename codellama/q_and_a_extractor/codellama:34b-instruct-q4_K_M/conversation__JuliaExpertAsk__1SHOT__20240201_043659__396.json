It then strips leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text using a separate helper function `strip_leading_spaces_and_newlines`. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the question and answer as strings.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the markdown-formatted text is well-formed and follows a specific structure. If the input text does not follow this structure, the extracted text may be incomplete or incorrect.","status":200,"tokens":[0,346],"elapsed":9.629269071,"_type":"aimessage"}]
