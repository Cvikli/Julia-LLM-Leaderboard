Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this task, such as slicing arrays, creating dictionaries, and using control structures.\n2. Define a function `q_and_a_extractor` with input parameter `md`, which is the markdown-formatted text.\n3. Use regular expressions to search for `# Question` and `# Answer` sections in the input text. You can use the `occursin` function from the Julia standard library to check if a string contains a specific substring.\n4. Extract the text between the `# Question` and `# Answer` sections, and strip any leading spaces and newlines using the `strip` function.\n5. Return the question and answer as a tuple of strings.\n6. Double-check that the solution is correct by testing it with sample input and output.\n\n## Preferred Libraries and Syntax:\n\n* Prefer the Julia standard libraries for tasks like text processing, string manipulation, and data structures.\n* Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive.\n* Emphasize performance, clarity, and abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n* Avoid creating new packages unless explicitly requested.\n* Use the `$` for string interpolation.\n\n## Distinguishing Features:\n\n* Julia is a 1-based indexing language, meaning that arrays start at index 1 instead of 0 like in Python.\n* Julia has multiple dispatch, which allows functions to have different implementations depending on the types of their arguments. This feature is distinct from single dispatch in languages like Python.\n\n## Special Instructions:\n\nNone.","status":200,"tokens":[0,377],"elapsed":10.633811874,"_type":"aimessage"}]
