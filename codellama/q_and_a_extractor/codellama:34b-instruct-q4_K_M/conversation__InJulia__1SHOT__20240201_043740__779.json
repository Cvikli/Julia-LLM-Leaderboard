It splits the markdown into sections using the regex pattern `^##`. The `# Question` and `# Answer` sections are found using the `findfirst` function, which returns the index of the first match in the array of sections.\n\nThe text in each section is extracted using the `strip` function to remove any leading spaces or newlines. The question and answer are returned as a tuple in the format `(question, answer)`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,254],"elapsed":7.046127895,"_type":"aimessage"}]
