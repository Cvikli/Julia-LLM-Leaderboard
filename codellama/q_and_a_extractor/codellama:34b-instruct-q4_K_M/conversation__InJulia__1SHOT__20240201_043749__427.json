[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could implement the `q_and_a_extractor` function in Julia:\n```\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Find the position of the first occurrence of \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\"\n    question_pos = findfirst(\"# Question\", md)\n    answer_pos = findfirst(\"# Answer\", md)\n\n    # Extract the text between the two positions\n    question = strip(md[question_pos+1:answer_pos-1])\n    answer = strip(md[answer_pos+1:end])\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function takes a single argument `md`, which is a string containing the markdown text. It first finds the position of the first occurrence of \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\" in the text using the `findfirst` function. Then it extracts the text between these two positions, strips any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text, and returns the question and answer as a tuple.\n\nYou can test this function with the following example markdown text:\n```\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n```\nCalling `q_and_a_extractor` on this text should return the tuple `(\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,311],"elapsed":8.637100317,"_type":"aimessage"}]
