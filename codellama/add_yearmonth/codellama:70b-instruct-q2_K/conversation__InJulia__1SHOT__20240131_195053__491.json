This creates a vector of integers like 202107 and 202108 in the format yyyymm.\n* We use the function on an example DataFrame with two rows, each representing a different day in July and August 2021.\n\nNote: If your dates are stored as strings instead of DateTimes, you should parse them first using `Date.(df.dt)`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,290],"elapsed":11.693704308,"_type":"aimessage"}]
