The `add_yearmonth` function first maps over the `dt` column to create a new vector (`ym`) of strings in format `\"yyyymm\"`, where the year and month are extracted from each date. Then, it returns a new DataFrame with the additional column `ym`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,148],"elapsed":5.946251446,"_type":"aimessage"}]
