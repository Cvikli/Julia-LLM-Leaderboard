We can use the `yearmonth` function from this module to extract the year and month components from the DateTime objects in the `dt` column of the DataFrame. Then, we can concatenate them together as integers using string interpolation and parse the resulting strings back into integers using the `parse` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    ym = yearmonth.(df.dt)\n    df.ym = map(ym) do ym\n        parse(Int, \"$(ym[1])$(ym[2])\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn the code above, we use a `map` call to apply the transformation function to each element of the vector produced by the `yearmonth` function. The `parse(Int, s)` function parses the string `s` as an integer value. Finally, we add the transformed column to the DataFrame using `df.ym`.\n\nYou can now call the `add_yearmonth` function on your input DataFrame:\n\n```julia\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThe resulting DataFrame will contain a new `ym` column with values in the format you specified, such as 202005 for May of 2020.","status":200,"tokens":[0,306],"elapsed":12.428530245,"_type":"aimessage"}]
