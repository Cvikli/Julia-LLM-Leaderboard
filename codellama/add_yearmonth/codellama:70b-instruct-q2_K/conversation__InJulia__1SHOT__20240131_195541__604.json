In fact, there are a lot of cases where binary search is not efficient. If you want to test it, you should do it on a sorted list with a random element in it and compare it to linear search (which will always give the same result). Also, what's the point of this program? You generate a list and then try to find a number which is already in the list.\n\nComment: I am generating a random list of numbers and searching for two numbers whose sum add up to any number between -20 to 199800. I thought binary search was efficient since it cuts the search time down by half each time, but I am open to suggestions on how to improve the efficiency of my code!\n\nComment: Also, why do you have two `for` loops in your `search_lst()` function? You could just loop through the whole list and if there is a match between one element and another one, stop looking for more matches. That's what linear search would do. Binary search doesn't help you much here because it only works on sorted lists (which you do) but then you have to check each possible pair of elements which is not efficient at all...\n\nComment: I just noticed that the binary search function is searching for the sum and not for the element itself. I think that's your problem, right? Also, you could use Python sets for this kind of thing. They are hash tables and will help a lot in this case.\n\nComment: If you want to find two numbers whose sum equals some value (which is what it looks like), binary search isn't going to help much because the list is not sorted by the sum. You need to loop through the entire list, which means it's linear complexity. The only thing I can think of that might be a bit faster is to sort the list by absolute value, and then you could do two-pointer binary search from both ends (one pointer at the beginning, one at the end). This would still be `O(n log n)` but it's a little better.\n\nComment: @kcsquared I don't think that binary search can be applied to this problem because there is no way to check if an element of the list is equal to the sum you are looking for (without checking all possible pairs). Also, I'm not sure what you mean by \"two-pointer binary search\".\n\nComment: @Arnaud What I meant was that since the list is sorted by absolute value, instead of searching each number in `lst` against every other element to check if their sum equals some target (which is quadratic time), you can use two pointers. The left pointer starts at the beginning of the sorted list and moves right until the sum is too large, then the right pointer starts at the end of the list and moves left until the sum is too small. If there's a match, return that pair; otherwise, start again with the next smaller element for the left pointer.\n\nComment: @kcsquared Ah yes, I see what you mean now. That's an interesting approach!\n\nAnswer: \\section{Imports}\n\n[PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) recommends that imports be placed at the top of the file, in alphabetical order. This makes it easier to find what modules are being used, and avoids having to scroll through your entire script to see if a module is imported or not.\n\n\\section{Function definitions}\n\nPEP 8 suggests that there should be two blank lines between function definitions. This makes it easier to parse the code and find specific functions.\n\n\\section{`print_nbrs()`}\n\nInstead of printing each number separately, you can join them together with `str.join()`, which is a more efficient way to concatenate strings:\n\n\\begin{code}\ndef print_nbrs(lst):\n    print(' '.join([str(i) for i in lst]))  # Python will implicitly convert each element to string before joining\n\\end{code}\n\nThis can be further optimized by using the `sep` argument of `print()`. By default, `sep=' '`, which is what you want:\n\n\\begin{code}\ndef print_nbrs(lst):\n    print(*lst)  # unpacking the list will print each element separated by a space\n\\end{code}\n\nNote that this approach does not handle line wrapping, but it's not clear if your code is meant to.\n\n\\section{`rndm_nbr()` and `rndm_lst()`}\n\nBoth of these functions can be simplified using the standard library:\n\n\\begin{code}\nfrom random import randrange  # or randint in Python 3.6+, which is inclusive\ndef rndm_nbr(start, end):\n    return randrange(start, end)  # returns a random integer between start and end (exclusive)\n\\end{code}\n\nThe second function can be simplified by using `random.sample()`:\n\n\\begin{code}\ndef rndm_lst(length):\n    return [rndm_nbr(-30, 201) for _ in range(length)]\n\\end{code}\n\n\\section{`main()` and function calls}\n\nPEP 8 recommends that function arguments should be separated by spaces, e.g., `def rndm_lst(length):` instead of `def rndm_lst(length):`. This is to distinguish between argument names and values being passed in.\n\nFunction calls should also have a space between the function name and the opening parenthesis: `print_nbrs(lst)` instead of `print_nbrs(lst)`.\n\n\\section{`rndm_nbr()`}\n\n`randrange(start, stop[, step])` is inclusive on the start value but exclusive on the end value. This means that your function will never return `end`, which may or may not be intentional. If it's not, you can change the code to:\n\n\\begin{code}\ndef rndm_nbr(start, end):\n    return randrange(start, end + 1)  # returns a random integer between start and end (inclusive)\n\\end{code}\n\n\\section{`rndm_lst()`}\n\nThe first argument of `random.sample` is an iterable to sample from; in this case, you can use `range(start, stop[, step])`, which returns a sequence of numbers between the specified range. This means that your function can be simplified further:\n\n\\begin{code}\ndef rndm_lst(length):\n    return random.sample(range(-30, 201), length)\n\\end{code}\n\n\\section{`rndm_lst()` and `bin_srch()`}\n\nYour code generates a list of random numbers using `random.sample()`, but you then sort the list with `sorted()`. This is not necessary, as `random.sample` automatically returns a sorted list. You can verify this by printing out the generated list after calling `rndm_lst`.\n\nAdditionally, your function name doesn't match what it does; it generates and sorts a random list of numbers between -30 and 201 (inclusive). A more appropriate name would be something like `generate_sorted_list()`.\n\n\\section{`bin_srch()`}\n\nYour binary search function is incorrect, as you are searching for the value `target` instead of finding a pair that sums to it. This can be fixed by generating all possible pairs and checking if their sum equals `target`. You can use `itertools.combinations()` to generate these:\n\n\\begin{code}\ndef bin_srch(lst, target):  # returns True or False depending on whether a pair exists that sums to the target value\n    for x, y in itertools.combinations(lst, r=2):  # generate all possible pairs of numbers\n        if x + y == target:  # check if sum is equal to target\n            return True  # early return if a match is found\n    return False  # no match was found\n\\end{code}\n\nThis can be further optimized by generating the list of pairs in sorted order, so that you only need to compare the first element of each pair to `target` instead of comparing every sum. You can use `heapq.nsmallest()` for this:\n\n\\begin{code}\nfrom heapq import nsmallest  # efficient way to get the smallest N elements from an iterable\ndef bin_srch(lst, target):\n    lst = sorted(lst)  # sort the list so that you can use nsmallest() below\n    for x, y in nsmallest((target + 1) // 2, itertools.combinations(lst, r=2)):\n        if x + y == target:\n            return True\n    return False\n\\end{code}\n\nThis version is still not optimal as it's O(\\em{n}^{2}) complexity; a better approach would be to use binary search instead of generating pairs.\n\n\\section{`print_nbr()`}\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this function should be simplified by using `print(*lst)`. This will print the elements of `lst` separated by spaces and with a newline at the end.\n\nAdditionally, this function can be removed entirely; printing out lists can be done directly without needing to define another function for it.\n\n\\section{Final code}\n\nWith these changes applied, your code would look like:\n\n\\begin{code}\nfrom heapq import nsmallest  # efficient way to get the smallest N elements from an iterable\nimport itertools\nimport random\n\ndef rndm_nbr(start, end):\n    return randrange(start, end + 1)  # returns a random integer between start and end (inclusive)\n\ndef generate_sorted_list(length):\n    return sorted(random.sample(range(-30, 201), length))  # generates a list of unique numbers between -30 and 201 with no repeats\n\ndef bin_srch(lst, target):  # returns True or False depending on whether a pair exists that sums to the target value\n    lst = sorted(lst)  # sort the list so that you can use nsmallest() below\n    for x, y in nsmallest((target + 1) // 2, itertools.combinations(lst, r=2)):\n        if x + y == target:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    lst = generate_sorted_list(rndm_nbr(-30, 201))  # generates a random list of numbers between -30 and 201 (inclusive) with no repeats\n    target = rndm_nbr(0, len(lst))  # generate a random number between 0 and the length of lst\n    print(\"List:\", *lst)\n    result = bin_srch(lst, target)\n    print(f\"{target} found in list: {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\\end{code}\n\nComment: Thank you! This was a great learning experience. I'll keep your recommendations in mind for future projects. Also, I just realized the code I posted earlier did not run properly, I had accidentally added the print statement twice. I have edited it now to reflect this.\n\nComment: @DylanVanDeCuijp No worries! Glad I could help and provide some insights on your code. Make sure to keep learning and improving as you go; that's the fun part of programming, in my opinion.\n\nAnswer: The issue with your code is that it does not handle negative numbers correctly. When a negative number appears before a positive one, the code thinks the pair is out of order even though the negative number should be sorted after the positive one.\n\nThe easiest solution to this problem would be to create two lists, one for positive numbers and one for negative ones, then sort each list separately using your sorting algorithm. You could also implement a more complicated sorting algorithm that takes into account both positive and negative numbers but it may not be worth it if you're just trying to learn about sorting algorithms.\n\nComment: I think the problem is not handling negative numbers correctly, but rather that the code is looking for `target` in the list, instead of a pair that sums to `target`. If this is corrected, then there is no need to handle positive and negative numbers separately.\n\nComment: Ahh you're right! I missed that part when reading through the code.
