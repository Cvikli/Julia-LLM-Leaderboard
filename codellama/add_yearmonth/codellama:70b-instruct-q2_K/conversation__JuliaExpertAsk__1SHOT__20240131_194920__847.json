It uses the built-in Julia functions `year()` and `month()` from the Dates package to extract the year and month respectively from the date-time values in the `dt` column. The result is combined into one integer by concatenating the two extracted numbers.","status":200,"tokens":[0,186],"elapsed":7.487218263,"_type":"aimessage"}]
