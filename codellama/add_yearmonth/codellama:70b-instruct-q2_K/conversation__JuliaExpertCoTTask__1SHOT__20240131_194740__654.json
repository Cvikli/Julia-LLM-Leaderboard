You will need to use the `Dates` module for that. The function could be written as follows:\n```julia\nusing Dates\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    df[:ym] = [Date(d).year * 100 + Date(d).month for d in df[:dt]]\nend\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nIn this solution, the `Dates` module is used to extract the year and month from each DateTime value. The function creates a new column named `ym` by concatenating the year and month together as an integer using list comprehension.","status":200,"tokens":[0,153],"elapsed":6.200189599,"_type":"aimessage"}]
