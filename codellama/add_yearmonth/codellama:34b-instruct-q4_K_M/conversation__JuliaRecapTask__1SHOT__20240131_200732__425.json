[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

We will then concatenate them together as an integer in format \"yyyymm\" and store it in a new column `ym`.\n\nHere is the solution:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[\"ym\"] = map(dt -> DateTime(dt).year * 100 + DateTime(dt).month, df.dt)\nend\n```\nIn this solution, we define a function `add_yearmonth` that takes a DataFrame `df` as input and returns nothing. We use the `map` function to apply a lambda function to each element in the `dt` column of the DataFrame, which extracts the year and month from the `DateTime` object using the `.year` and `.month` properties, respectively. The extracted values are then concatenated together as an integer in format \"yyyymm\" and stored in a new column `ym` in the DataFrame.\n\nNote that we use the `using Dates` statement to import the `DateTime` type from the Julia standard library, which provides a convenient way to work with date and time data.","status":200,"tokens":[0,293],"elapsed":8.166847085,"_type":"aimessage"}]
