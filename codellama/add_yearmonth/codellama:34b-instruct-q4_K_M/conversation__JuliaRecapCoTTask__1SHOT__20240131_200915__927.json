Solve the task using the following steps:\na. Extract year and month from `dt` column of `df` using `year` and `month` functions from `Dates` module.\nb. Concatenate them together as an integer in format \"yyyymm\" using string interpolation.\nc. Assign the resulting vector to a new column `ym` of `df`.\n3.
