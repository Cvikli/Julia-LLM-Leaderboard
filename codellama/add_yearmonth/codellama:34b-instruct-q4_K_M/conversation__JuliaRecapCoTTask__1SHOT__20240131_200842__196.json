X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

Solve the Task by writing a function `add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)::DataFrame` that creates a new column `ym` in the input DataFrame `df` by extracting year and month from the `dt` column using `DateTime` library, concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct by testing it on different inputs and ensuring that the output is consistent with the expected results.\n# Preferred Libraries and Approach:\n\nThe `Date` and `DateTime` libraries are preferred for date and time manipulation in Julia, respectively. The `string` functions can be used to format the output as desired. The `add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)::DataFrame` function should return a new DataFrame with the added column `ym`.\n# Special Instructions:\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.","status":200,"tokens":[11,268],"elapsed":7.511911981,"_type":"aimessage"}]
