The transformation is defined as a lambda expression that takes a `DateTime` value and returns a string representing the year and month in format \"yyyymm\". The resulting vector is then used to create a new column in the DataFrame, which is returned by the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,143],"elapsed":1.858660058,"_type":"aimessage"}]
