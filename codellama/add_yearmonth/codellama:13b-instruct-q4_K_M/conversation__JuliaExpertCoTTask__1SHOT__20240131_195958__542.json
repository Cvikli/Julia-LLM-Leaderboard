We use the `map` function to apply a function to each element of the `dt` column in the `df` dataframe. The function takes a DateTime object and returns a string containing the year and month concatenated together.\n2. We then use `hcat` to horizontally concatenate the original `df` dataframe with a new DataFrame that contains the `ym` column we created using the `map` function.\n3. The resulting output is a dataframe with two columns: `dt` and `ym`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,186],"elapsed":2.444499624,"_type":"aimessage"}]
