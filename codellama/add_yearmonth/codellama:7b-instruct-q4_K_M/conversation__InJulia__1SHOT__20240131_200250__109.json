The resulting strings are then concatenated together as an integer in format \"yyyymm\" using string manipulation.\n\nNote that the `lpad` function is used to pad the month with a leading zero if it has less than two digits, so that the resulting string always has the same length.","status":200,"tokens":[0,179],"elapsed":1.457823467,"_type":"aimessage"}]
