The resulting values are then converted to strings in the format \"yyyymm\" and added to the new column.\n\nNote that this function uses the `string.` and `YearMonth.` functions, which are part of the `Dates` package in Julia. These functions allow you to convert between different types of date representations, such as `DateTime` and `Date`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,158],"elapsed":1.285693017,"_type":"aimessage"}]
