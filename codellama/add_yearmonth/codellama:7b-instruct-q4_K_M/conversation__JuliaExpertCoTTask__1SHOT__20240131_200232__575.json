The `format` function is used to convert the DateTime object to a string.\n* `[format(date, \"yyyyMM\") for date in df.dt]` creates an array of strings by applying the `format` function to each element in the `df.dt` column.\n* `df.ym = [format(date, \"yyyyMM\") for date in df.dt]` assigns this array of strings to a new column `ym` in the DataFrame.\n* `return df` returns the updated DataFrame with the new column `ym`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,275],"elapsed":2.269979395,"_type":"aimessage"}]
