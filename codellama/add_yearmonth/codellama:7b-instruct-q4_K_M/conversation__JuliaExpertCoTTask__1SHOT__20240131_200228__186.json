First, we define the function `add_yearmonth` which takes a DataFrame `df` as input and adds a new column `ym`.\n2. Inside the function, we use the `map` function to iterate over each element in the `dt` column of the DataFrame and extract the year and month from each DateTime object using the `.year` and `.month` properties.\n3. We then pad the month with a leading zero if it is less than 10, using the `lpad` function.\n4. Finally, we concatenate the year and padded month into a single string using the `string` function, and assign the result to the new column `ym`.\n5. We return the updated DataFrame with the new `ym` column added.\n\nNote: The `lpad` function is used to pad the month with a leading zero if it is less than 10, as the resulting string would otherwise be missing the leading zero.","status":200,"tokens":[0,345],"elapsed":2.857949574,"_type":"aimessage"}]
