Please note that I am using Julia language here.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames # Required for working with dataframes in Julia\nusing Dates      # Required for working with dates and times in Julia\n\n# Function add_yearmonth\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    if !hasproperty(df, :dt) || eltype(df.dt) != DateTime\n        throw(\"Input df must have a column named 'dt' of type DateTime.\")\n    end\n\n    # Create new column ym with the concatenated year and month as an integer (yyyymm)\n    df[:ym] = Integer.(Dates.yearmonth.(df.dt))\nend\n```\nThis function `add_yearmonth` will add a new column `ym` to your dataframe `df`. It first checks if the input DataFrame has a column named \"dt\" of type DateTime, and then creates a new column `ym` that concatenates the year and month from the `dt` column as an integer in the format `yyyymm`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,245],"elapsed":13.06679367,"_type":"aimessage"}]
