In this case, the format `\"yyyymm\"` indicates that the year and month should be included in the output string without any separator between them.\n* `Dates.Date` converts the input to a `Date`, which is necessary because we want the `format` function to operate on dates rather than datetimes.\n* The result of all these operations is a new column `ym` added to the dataframe `df`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,249],"elapsed":13.289826008,"_type":"aimessage"}]
