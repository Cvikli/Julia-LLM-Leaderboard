We can use the **Date** module to manipulate dates and times in Julia. \n3. The `DateTime` function from the Date module is used to create DateTime objects representing a specific date and time. \n4. The `year`, `month`, and `day` functions are used to extract information about the year, month, and day respectively from a given DateTime object. \n5. String concatenation (`*`) and integer conversion (`Int64`) are used to combine the year and month into an integer in the format \"yyyymm\". \n6. The `insertcols!` function is used to insert columns into DataFrames.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates  # Use Julia's Date module for DateTime manipulation\n\n# Define a function add_yearmonth that adds a new column 'ym' based on the year and month from the existing 'dt' column\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    # Extract the year and month from each row of the 'dt' column\n    ym = [Int64(year(date)*100 + month(date)) for date in df.dt]\n\n    # Insert the new 'ym' column into the DataFrame after the 'dt' column\n    insertcols!(df, :ym => ym, :after => :dt)\nend\n\n# Create a test DataFrame with DateTime objects (dt)\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\n\n# Call the add_yearmonth function to process the test DataFrame and display the result\nadd_yearmonth(df)\ndisplay(df)\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `add_yearmonth` that takes a DataFrame with a column `dt` representing DateTimes as input.
