Finally, concatenate them together as an integer in the required format:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Chain, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    @chain df begin\n        transform(:dt => (x -> Date(x, dateformat\"yyyy-mm-dd\")) => :date)\n        transform([:date] .=> ByRow.(year, month) .=> [:year, :month])\n        transform([:year, :month] .=> ByRow.((y, m)-> y * 100 + m) .=> :ym)\n    end\nend\n```\nIn the above code snippet, the `df` DataFrame is first transformed by applying the `@chain` macro to it. We start by converting the DateTime column (`:dt`) into a Date using the `Date()` function and specifying the format as `\"yyyy-mm-dd\"`. Then we extract the year and month from this Date and store them in separate columns named `:year` and `:month`, respectively. Finally, we concatenate these two columns together to create the new column `:ym` by multiplying the year by 100 and adding the month to it, effectively creating an integer in the required format.","status":200,"tokens":[0,326],"elapsed":17.339537233,"_type":"aimessage"}]
