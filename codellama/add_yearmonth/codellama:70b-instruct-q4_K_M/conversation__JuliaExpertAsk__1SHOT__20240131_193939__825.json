Then, it concatenates them together as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\" by converting the extracted year and month to strings, padding the month with zeros if necessary (using `lpad`), and then parsing the combined string back into an integer. The resulting integers are assigned to the new column `ym`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,215],"elapsed":11.410167772,"_type":"aimessage"}]
