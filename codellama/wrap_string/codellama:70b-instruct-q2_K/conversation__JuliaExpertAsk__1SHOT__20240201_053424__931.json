The function iterates over words in the string, splitting them using spaces as delimiters. It adds each word to a new string with a space after it. If adding the next word would cause the line to exceed the specified width, it inserts a newline character instead of a space before adding the word.","status":200,"tokens":[0,346],"elapsed":14.326211474,"_type":"aimessage"}]
