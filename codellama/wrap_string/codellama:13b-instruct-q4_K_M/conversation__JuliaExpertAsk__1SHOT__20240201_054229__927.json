It splits the text into words using the `split()` function, and then iterates over each word to check if it exceeds the maximum width. If it does, a new line is added to the wrapped string. The word itself is appended to the wrapped string, followed by a space if it's not the last word. Finally, the wrapped string is returned.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\ntext = \"This is a very long text that should be wrapped at 10 characters.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\nThis will output:\n```\nThis is a very\nlong text that\nshould be wrapped\nat 10 characters.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,304],"elapsed":4.009155215,"_type":"aimessage"}]
