[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded.

We initialize an empty array `lines` and a variable `line` to keep track of the current line being constructed.\n3. In the loop, we check if adding the length of the current word would exceed the maximum text width. If it does, we add the current line to `lines`, reset `line` to an empty string, and continue with the next word. Otherwise, we concatenate the word to the current line using a space as a separator.\n4. At the end of the loop, we add the last line to `lines`.\n5. We return the array of lines.\n\nExample:\n```julia\njulia> wrap_string(\"This is a very long string with spaces\", 10)\n3-element Array{String,1}:\n \"This is a\"\n \"very long\"\n \"string with\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,339],"elapsed":4.605369592,"_type":"aimessage"}]
