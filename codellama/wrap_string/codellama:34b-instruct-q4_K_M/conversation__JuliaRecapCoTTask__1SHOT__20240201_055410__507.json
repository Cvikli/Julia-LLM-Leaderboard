[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

It then initializes an empty list called `wrapped` to store the lines of the wrapped string, and a variable called `current_line` to keep track of the current line being built.\n\nThe function then loops over each word in the input string, and checks whether adding the word to the current line would exceed the maximum width. If it would, the function adds the current line to the list of wrapped lines, and starts a new line with the current word. Otherwise, it adds the word to the current line separated by a space.\n\nAfter looping over all the words in the input string, the function adds the final line to the list of wrapped lines and returns the joined list as a single string with newline characters separating each line.","status":200,"tokens":[0,463],"elapsed":13.043549306,"_type":"aimessage"}]
