If not specified, it defaults to 10. The function splits the input string into words using the `split` function and iterates over them. For each word, it checks if the length of the current line plus the length of the current word exceeds the `text_width`. If it does, a new line is created by pushing an empty string to the `lines` array. The word is then pushed to the same array. Once all words have been processed, the lines are joined using the `join` function and returned as a single string.\n\nExample usage:\n```\njulia> wrap_string(\"This is a sample text that needs to be wrapped\", 10)\n\"This is a\\nsample text\\nthat needs\\nto be wrapped\"\n```\nIn this example, the input string \"This is a sample text that needs to be wrapped\" is split into words and then wrapped at a maximum width of 10 characters. The resulting lines are joined using newlines and returned as a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,332],"elapsed":2.775858017,"_type":"aimessage"}]
