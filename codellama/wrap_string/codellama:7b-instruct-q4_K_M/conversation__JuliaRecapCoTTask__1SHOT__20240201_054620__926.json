[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

We then iterate over these words and check if the length of the current line plus the length of the current word exceeds the maximum text width. If it does, we push the current line to a new array and reset the line to an empty string.\n\nWe continue this process until we have wrapped all the words into lines that are less than or equal to the maximum text width. Finally, we push the last line to the wrapped words array and return it.\n\nNote that we also provide a default value of `text_width` to be 10 if no argument is provided. This makes it easier for the user to use the function without having to specify an argument.","status":200,"tokens":[0,351],"elapsed":3.042313947,"_type":"aimessage"}]
