Here's how it works:\n\n1. The function takes a string `md` representing the markdown document with julia code blocks.\n2. We split the `md` string into an array of lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n3. We loop through each line in the array and check if it starts with `\"```julia\\n\"`. If it does, we add it to an array called `code_blocks`.\n4. After looping through all the lines, we join the code blocks together using `join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")` and return the resulting string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,249],"elapsed":3.469303192,"_type":"aimessage"}]
