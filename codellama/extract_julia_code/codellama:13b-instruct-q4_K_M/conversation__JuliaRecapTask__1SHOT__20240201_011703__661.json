[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

We define a regular expression `pattern` that matches all Julia code blocks in the markdown document. The regular expression uses the `.*?` quantifier to match any character (including newlines) between the code fences (`\\n```julia\\n` and `\\n````).\n2. We use the `collect(eachmatch(pattern, md))` function to collect all the matches of the regular expression in a vector. The `eachmatch` function returns an iterator over the matches, which we then convert to a vector using `collect`.\n3. We use the `map` function to remove the code fences from each match by replacing them with an empty string (`strip`). This gives us a vector of strings, where each string is a Julia code block without the code fence.\n4. We use the `join` function to join the code blocks together with a newline character. The resulting string contains all the Julia code in the markdown document.\n\nThat's it!","status":200,"tokens":[0,377],"elapsed":5.160147277,"_type":"aimessage"}]
