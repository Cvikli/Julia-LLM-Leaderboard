[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an implementation of `extract_julia_code` function based on the guidelines provided:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    # split markdown document into code blocks and non-code blocks\n    code_blocks = split(md, \"```\")\n    # remove code fences from each code block\n    code_blocks = [strip(c) for c in code_blocks]\n    # join the code blocks together with a newline\n    code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    return strip(code)\nend\n```\nThis implementation uses the `split` function to split the markdown document into code blocks and non-code blocks. It then removes the code fences from each code block using the `strip` function, and joins the code blocks together with a newline character using the `join` function. Finally, it returns the joined string as a String object.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the markdown document is in the standard format where code blocks are surrounded by three backticks (`````). If the markdown document uses a different syntax for code blocks, the implementation may need to be modified accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,268],"elapsed":3.632132121,"_type":"aimessage"}]
