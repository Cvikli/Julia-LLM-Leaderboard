Here's an example of how you could do that:\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::Markdown.MD)\n    # Get all the code blocks in the markdown document\n    code_blocks = Markdown.CodeBlock.(md, \"julia\")\n    \n    # Remove code fences from each code block\n    for i in 1:length(code_blocks)\n        code_blocks[i].fence = \"\"\n    end\n    \n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = join([c.content for c in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nYou can use this function to extract the Julia code from any markdown document that contains Julia language code blocks. For example:\n```julia\n# Load the markdown document\nmd = Markdown.parse_file(\"my_markdown_document.md\")\n\n# Extract the Julia code from the markdown document\ncode = extract_julia_code(md)\n\n# Print the extracted Julia code\nprintln(code)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,367],"elapsed":4.84455294,"_type":"aimessage"}]
