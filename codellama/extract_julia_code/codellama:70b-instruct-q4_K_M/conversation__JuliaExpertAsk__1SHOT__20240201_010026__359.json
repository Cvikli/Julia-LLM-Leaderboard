Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can try to create a function named `extract_julia_code` that takes in a markdown document as an argument and extracts all the Julia language code blocks from it. Here's how you could do so:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Initialize a string to store the extracted Julia code\n    extracted_code = \"\"\n    \n    # Split the markdown document by line\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Set a flag to keep track of whether we are in a code block or not\n    in_julia_block = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if occursin(\"```julia\", line)\n            # If the current line starts with \"```julia\", it means we are entering a Julia code block\n            in_julia_block = true\n            \n        elseif occursin(\"```\", line) && in_julia_block\n            # If the current line starts with \"```\" and we are already inside a Julia code block, it means we are exiting that block\n            in_julia_block = false\n        \n        elseif in_julia_block\n            # If we are inside a Julia code block, append the current line to our extracted code string\n            extracted_code *= line * \"\\n\"\n            \n        end\n    end\n    \n    return extracted_code\nend\n```\nIn this function, we iterate through each line of the markdown document and check if it starts with ```julia. If it does, we set a flag `in_julia_block` to true indicating that we are inside a Julia code block. If the current line is just ```, we set `in_julia_block` to false as we have exited the Julia code block. If we are already in a Julia code block, we append the current line to our extracted code string.\nThis function will extract all Julia code blocks from the provided markdown document and return them as one string with each line separated by a newline character.","status":200,"tokens":[0,465],"elapsed":25.17883723,"_type":"aimessage"}]
