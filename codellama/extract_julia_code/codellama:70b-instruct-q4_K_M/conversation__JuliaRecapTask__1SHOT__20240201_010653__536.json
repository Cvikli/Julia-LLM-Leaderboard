X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n\t- Julia is a strongly typed language, emphasize on type annotations to ensure performance and clarity.\n\t- Functions are the primary unit of abstraction in Julia, use them effectively to break down tasks into smaller pieces.\n2. Solve the Task\n\t- Extract all code blocks from the Markdown document: Use regular expressions to extract all code fences (` ``` `), including any content between them.\n\t- Remove code fences and join code blocks together: For each matched code block, remove the leading and trailing triple backticks (` ``` `) and append it to a string with newline separators.\n\t- Return the combined string containing all Julia code blocks: Finally, return the string with concatenated code blocks as the function output.\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct\n\t- Run unit tests on the function to ensure it meets the requirements and handles edge cases properly.\n\t- Verify that the output contains only valid Julia syntax, without any Markdown or formatting artifacts.\n4. Review the solution and provide feedback to improve future responses\n\t- Thank you for providing detailed instructions and allowing me to assist with solving problems in a systematic way! ðŸ˜Š","status":200,"tokens":[0,272],"elapsed":14.861434956,"_type":"aimessage"}]
