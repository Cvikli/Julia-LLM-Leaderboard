Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"This function takes one argument `md` which is a markdown document as a string. It will extract all the julia code blocks in this document and return them in a single string, with each block separated by a newline. Here's how it works step-by-step:\n\n1. Split the input string into lines using the `split` function. This creates an array of strings, where each element is a line from the original markdown document.\n2. Create an empty list to store all the extracted code blocks. We will add each code block to this list as we find them.\n3. Iterate through each line in the input string:\n\t1. Check if the current line starts with \"```julia\". If it does, start a new variable `inside_code_block` and set it to true. This indicates that we are now inside a code block.\n\t2. If we are inside a code block (i.e., `inside_code_block == true`), check if the current line starts with \"```\". If it does, end the code block by setting `inside_code_block` to false and skipping this iteration.\n\t3. If we are inside a code block and the current line is not the ending fence (```), append it to the last element of the list of extracted code blocks. We use `push!` for this, as each code block will be appended to the same string (separated by newlines).\n4. Once we've finished iterating through all the lines in the input markdown document, join together the extracted code blocks using the `join` function and return them as a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,358],"elapsed":19.266110869,"_type":"aimessage"}]
