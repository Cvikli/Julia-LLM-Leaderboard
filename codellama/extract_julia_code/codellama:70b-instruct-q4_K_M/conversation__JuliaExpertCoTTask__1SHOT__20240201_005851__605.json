[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"1. Define the function `extract_julia_code` that takes a single argument, a string containing markdown document `md`:\n    ```julia\n    function extract_julia_code(md)\n        code = \"\" # initialize empty code string to store extracted code blocks\n        ...\n        return code\n    end\n    ```\n2. Use the `matchall` function to find all matches for regex pattern `\"(?s)```julia\\\\n(.*?)\\\\n```\"`. This will match and capture the code within all julia language code blocks:\n    ```julia\n        ...\n        blocks = matchall(r\"(?s)```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md)\n        for block in blocks\n            ...\n        end\n        return code\n    end\n    ```\n3. Iterate through each matched block and append the captured code to the `code` string, separated by a newline:\n    ```julia\n        ...\n        blocks = matchall(r\"(?s)```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md)\n        for block in blocks\n            code *= \"\\n$(block[1])\" # append the captured code block to 'code' string\n        end\n        return code\n    end\n    ```\n4. Strip the leading newline and trailing whitespace from the extracted `code` string using `strip`:\n    ```julia\n        ...\n        blocks = matchall(r\"(?s)```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md)\n        for block in blocks\n            code *= \"\\n$(block[1])\" # append the captured code block to 'code' string\n        end\n        return strip(code) # remove leading newline and trailing whitespace from extracted code\n    end\n    ```\n5. The complete `extract_julia_code` function should look like this:\n    ```julia\n    function extract_julia_code(md)\n        code = \"\"\n        blocks = matchall(r\"(?s)```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md)\n        for block in blocks\n            code *= \"\\n$(block[1])\"\n        end\n        return strip(code)\n    end\n    ```","status":200,"tokens":[0,507],"elapsed":27.349438559,"_type":"aimessage"}]
