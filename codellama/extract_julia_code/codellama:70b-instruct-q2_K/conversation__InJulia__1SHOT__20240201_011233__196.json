Here's a breakdown of what you need to do:\n\n**Objective:** Your objective is to extract all Julia code blocks from a Markdown document and return them as a single string.\n\n**Code Fences:** Code fences are the triple backticks (\\`\\`\\`) that denote the beginning and end of a code block in Markdown. The code fence for Julia code blocks is \\`\\`\\`julia.\n\n**Joining Multiple Code Blocks:** If there are multiple Julia code blocks, you need to join them together with newlines.\n\nHere's what you should do:\n\n1.  **Extract All Code Blocks:** Use the regex `\\`\\`\\`julia((?:.*|\\n)*?)\\`\\`\\`` to extract all code blocks from the Markdown document. This will give you an array of matches, where each match is a Julia code block with the leading and trailing code fences included.\n2.  **Remove Code Fences:** Iterate through each match and remove the leading and trailing code fences (the first three backticks).\n3.  **Join Multiple Code Blocks:** Join all the extracted blocks together, separated by newlines. This will give you a single string containing all the Julia code from the Markdown document.\n4.  **Return Extracted String:** Return the combined string as your function's output.\n\nHere's some pseudocode to get you started:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Extract all code blocks with regex\n    matches = regex_extract(\\`\\`\\`julia((?:.*|\\n)*?)\\`\\`\\`, md)\n    extracted_blocks = []\n    for match in matches\n        # Remove leading and trailing code fences (3 backticks)\n        block = replace(match, \\`\\`\\`julia\\|\\\\\\`\\`\\`\\) with \"\"\n        push!(extracted_blocks, block)\n    end\n    # Join extracted blocks together with newlines\n    joined_string = join(extracted_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    return joined_string\nend\n```\n\nNow you have a basic idea of what needs to be done. It's up to you to flesh out the details and turn it into working code! ðŸ˜Š","status":200,"tokens":[0,566],"elapsed":23.47436083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
