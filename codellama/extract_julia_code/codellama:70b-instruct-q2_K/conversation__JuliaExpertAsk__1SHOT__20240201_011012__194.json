Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Julia solution\n  function extract_julia_code(md::String)\n      lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n\n      code_blocks = []\n      inside_code_block = false\n  \n      for line in lines\n          if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n              inside_code_block = true\n              continue\n          end\n  \n          if startswith(line, \"```\") && inside_code_block == true\n              inside_code_block = false\n              continue\n          end\n  \n          if inside_code_block == true\n              push!(code_blocks, line)\n          end\n      end\n  \n      return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n  end\n\nThis function iterates through the lines of the markdown document. When it encounters a code block starting with ```julia```, it starts appending each subsequent line to the `code_block` array until it reaches another ``` code fence. It then returns all the extracted Julia code as a single String, joining multiple code blocks together with newlines if there are more than one.","status":200,"tokens":[0,253],"elapsed":10.320304686,"_type":"aimessage"}]
