Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```Julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Define helper function to remove the first three and last three characters from a string\n    strip_fence = s -> s[4:end-3]\n    \n    # Split the markdown document into an array of strings, delimited by code fences \"```\"\n    chunks = split(md, \"```\")\n    \n    # Filter out any empty strings and apply the strip_fence function to each chunk\n    cleaned_chunks = filter(!isempty, map(strip_fence, chunks))\n    \n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline character \"\\n\" between them\n    return join(cleaned_chunks, '\\n')\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes in a markdown document as a string and returns a single string containing all Julia code blocks joined together with newlines. If no Julia code is found, an empty string is returned instead.\n\nNote that this solution assumes the existence of at least one code fence pair \"```, so if your input data may not contain any code blocks, you might want to add some extra handling for such cases.","status":200,"tokens":[127,263],"elapsed":11.03736513,"_type":"aimessage"}]
