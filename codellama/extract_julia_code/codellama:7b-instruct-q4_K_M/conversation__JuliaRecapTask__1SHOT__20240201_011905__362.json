[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could implement the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the extracted code\n    code = \"\"\n\n    # Iterate over each line in the markdown document\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        # Check if the line starts with a code fence (i.e., three backticks)\n        if startswith(line, \"```\")\n            # If so, remove the code fence and add the remaining line to the code\n            code *= strip(line[4:end])\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return the extracted code as a string\n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `eachline` function from the `IO` module to iterate over each line in the markdown document. It then checks if each line starts with three backticks (i.e., a code fence) using the `startswith` function. If it does, it removes the code fence and adds the remaining line to the `code` string. Finally, it returns the `code` string as a string.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that each code block in the markdown document is delimited by three backticks on each side, as described in the problem statement. If your markdown document uses a different delimiter (e.g., four backticks), you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,325],"elapsed":2.771753856,"_type":"aimessage"}]
