The regular expression `^```julia\\s*[\\S\\s]*?^```$` matches a code block that starts with ```julia``` and ends with ````, and includes any number of whitespace characters (`\\s`) or non-whitespace characters (`[\\S]`) in between. The `^` and `$` anchors ensure that the match is only for entire lines.\n\nThe function then joins all the code blocks together with a newline character (`\\n`).","status":200,"tokens":[0,212],"elapsed":1.80779329,"_type":"aimessage"}]
