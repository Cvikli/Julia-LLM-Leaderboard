For each line, it checks if it is a code fence (starts with ```julia) using the `startswith` function. If it is, it removes the code fence and any trailing whitespace using the `strip` function, and then adds the extracted code to the string. Finally, the function returns the combined code as a String.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the code blocks are enclosed in triple backticks (```julia) and that the language is specified after the opening backtick. If your markdown document has different syntax or formatting for the code blocks, you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,345],"elapsed":2.853623889,"_type":"aimessage"}]
