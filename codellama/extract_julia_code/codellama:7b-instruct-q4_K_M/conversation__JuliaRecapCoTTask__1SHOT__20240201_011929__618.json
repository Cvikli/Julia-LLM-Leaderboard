[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Create a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. The function should take in a markdown document `md` as input, and return a String containing the extracted Julia code.\n```scss\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n```\nTo achieve this, we will need to use regular expressions to match the code blocks in the markdown document. We can use the following pattern to match any line that starts with ```` and ends with ```.\n```scss\nconst CODE_BLOCK_PATTERN = /^\\`\\`\\`(?:\\s*[\\w\\W]*?\\s*)\\`\\`\\`$/g;\n```\nNext, we can use the `String.prototype.replace()` method to replace all occurrences of the code blocks with an empty string. This will effectively remove the code fences and any additional content within them.\n```scss\nconst extractedCode = md.replace(CODE_BLOCK_PATTERN, \"\");\n```\nFinally, we can use the `String.prototype.split()` method to split the remaining text into an array of lines. We can then join these lines together with a newline character using the `Array.prototype.join()` method.\n```scss\nconst code = extractedCode.split(\"\\n\").join(\"\\n\");\nreturn code;\n```\nTo test this function, we can use the following markdown document as input:\n```scss\n# Test Document\n\nThis is a test document with some **bold** and *italic* text.\n\nHere is a code block:\n```julia\nx = 10;\ny = 20;\nz = x + y;\n```\nAnd here is another code block:\n```julia\nfunction f(x)\n    return x^2;\nend\n```\nThe output should be a string containing the extracted Julia code.\n```scss\nconst md = `# Test Document\n\nThis is a test document with some **bold** and *italic* text.\n\nHere is a code block:\n\\`\\`\\`julia\nx = 10;\ny = 20;\nz = x + y;\n\\`\\`\\`\nAnd here is another code block:\n\\`\\`\\`julia\nfunction f(x)\n    return x^2;\nend\n\\`\\`\\`\n`;\nconst expectedOutput = `x = 10;\ny = 20;\nz = x + y;\n\nfunction f(x)\n    return x^2;\nend\n`;\nassert.strictEqual(extract_julia_code(md), expectedOutput);\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,632],"elapsed":5.436160719,"_type":"aimessage"}]
