[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String.

The `matchall` function returns an array of matches, where each match is a tuple containing the entire match and the capture groups (if any). In this case, we are only interested in the first capture group, which contains the code block itself.\n\nWe then join all the code blocks together with a newline character using the `join` function. The `join` function takes an array of strings as input and joins them together with a separator (in this case, a newline character).\n\nFinally, we return the joined string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,261],"elapsed":2.155038307,"_type":"aimessage"}]
