Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    code_blocks = []\n    for match in eachmatch(r\"^```julia\", md)\n        push!(code_blocks, match.captures[1])\n    end\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all code blocks that start with ```julia` and end with the next ``` character. It then extracts the code inside each block and joins it together into a single string using newlines as separators.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input markdown document is well-formed, i.e., that all code blocks are properly closed and that there are no other instances of the ```julia` sequence within the document. If the input document may contain errors or inconsistencies, you may need to add additional error checking or handling to the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,226],"elapsed":6.283292438,"_type":"aimessage"}]
