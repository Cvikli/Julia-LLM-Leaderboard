Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Answer\n\nHere's the function you can use to extract Julia code from a Markdown document:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Use a regular expression to match code blocks with fences\n    pattern = r\"^```julia\\n(.*?)^```$\"ms\n\n    # Find all matches and join them together\n    return join(map(match -> match.captures[1], eachmatch(pattern, md)), \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nNote that this function uses a regular expression to find code blocks with fences, and it assumes that the language used in the code block is Julia. If you want to support other languages or use different formatting for your code blocks, you'll need to modify the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[118,176],"elapsed":5.040371279,"_type":"aimessage"}]
