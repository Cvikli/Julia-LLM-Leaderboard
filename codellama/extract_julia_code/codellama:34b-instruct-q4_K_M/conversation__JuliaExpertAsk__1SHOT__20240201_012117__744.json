Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    blocks = split(md, \"```julia\")\n    code = \"\"\n    for block in blocks\n        if !isempty(block) && block[1] == '`'\n            code *= strip(block[2:end-1]) * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function first splits the markdown document into code blocks using the ```julia` delimiter. Then, it iterates over each block and removes the code fences (````) and any leading or trailing whitespace characters. Finally, it joins the remaining code blocks together with a newline character to form the extracted Julia code.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input markdown document is well-formed, meaning that each code block is properly delimited by backticks (```). If the input document is not well-formed, this function may produce unexpected results or even throw an error.","status":200,"tokens":[0,237],"elapsed":6.657844969,"_type":"aimessage"}]
