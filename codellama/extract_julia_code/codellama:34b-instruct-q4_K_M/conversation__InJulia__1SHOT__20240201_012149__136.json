It uses regular expressions to find all code blocks in the Markdown document that are delimited by triple backticks (```) and have \"julia\" in the first line. The `eachmatch` function is used to iterate over all matches of the regular expression, and the `map` function is used to extract the code from each match. Finally, the extracted code blocks are joined together with a newline using the `join` function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,253],"elapsed":7.009781409,"_type":"aimessage"}]
