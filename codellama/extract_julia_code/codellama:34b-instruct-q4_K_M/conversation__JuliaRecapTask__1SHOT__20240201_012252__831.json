[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could implement the `extract_julia_code` function using Julia:\n```\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::Markdown)::String\n    code_blocks = filter(c -> isa(c, Markdown.Code), md.content)\n    code = mapreduce(c -> c.text, *, code_blocks; init=\"\")\n    return replace(code, r\"^\\`\\`\\` julia\\n+\", \"\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `filter` and `mapreduce` functions from the Julia standard library to extract the code blocks from the Markdown document, remove any code fences (` ``` julia`) at the beginning of each block, and join the remaining code together with a newline character. Finally, it returns the resulting string.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that all code blocks in the Markdown document are written in Julia. If there are other languages represented, you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,221],"elapsed":6.212635742,"_type":"aimessage"}]
