[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String.

It loops through each element in the document and checks if it is a code block using the `isa` function. If it is a code block, it extracts the code and appends it to the `code` string with a newline character (`\\n`). Finally, it returns the `code` string.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the Markdown document has already been parsed into a `Markdown.MD` object using a library such as `Markdown.jl`. If the input is not a `Markdown.MD` object, you will need to parse the Markdown text first before passing it to this function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,271],"elapsed":7.539322591,"_type":"aimessage"}]
