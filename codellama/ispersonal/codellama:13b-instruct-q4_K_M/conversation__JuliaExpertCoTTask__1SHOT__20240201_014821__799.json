All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The function checks if the input vehicle is either a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`, and returns `true` if it is, or `false` otherwise. If no other subtype of `AbstractVehicle` is provided, the function defaults to returning `false`.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\njulia> Car() |> ispersonal\ntrue\n\njulia> Bus() |> ispersonal\nfalse\n\njulia> Truck() |> ispersonal\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,188],"elapsed":2.581161409,"_type":"aimessage"}]
