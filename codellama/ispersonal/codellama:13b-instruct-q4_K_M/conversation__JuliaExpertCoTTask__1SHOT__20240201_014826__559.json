I defined an `AbstractVehicle` type and its subtypes as `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`.\n2. I wrote a function `ispersonal` that takes an `AbstractVehicle` object as input and returns a boolean indicating whether it is a personal vehicle or not.\n3. In the body of the function, I used the `isa` keyword to check if the input argument is a subtype of `Car` or `Motorcycle`, which are the only types that should return `true`. If it's neither of those two types, then it must be one of the other three types (`Bus`, `Truck`, or any other type) and therefore returns `false`.\n4. I tested my function with an example input: `ispersonal(Car())` which should return `true`.\n5. Finally, I checked that my solution is correct by testing it with some other examples such as `ispersonal(Motorcycle())`, `ispersonal(Bus())`, and `ispersonal(Truck())`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,343],"elapsed":4.739382576,"_type":"aimessage"}]
