All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the `ispersonal` function:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(v::AbstractVehicle)\n    return v isa Union{Car,Motorcycle} ? true : false\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `isa` keyword to check if the input vehicle is a subtype of either `Car` or `Motorcycle`. If it is, then the function returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`. The default return value for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle` is `false`.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\nv = Car()\n@assert ispersonal(v) == true\n\nv = Motorcycle()\n@assert ispersonal(v) == true\n\nv = Bus()\n@assert ispersonal(v) == false\n\nv = Truck()\n@assert ispersonal(v) == false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,261],"elapsed":3.656741727,"_type":"aimessage"}]
