All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's one way to implement the `ispersonal` function:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    return vehicle isa Union{Car, Motorcycle} ? true : false\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `isa` function to check if the provided argument is a subtype of `Car` or `Motorcycle`. If it is, then the function returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`. The default return value for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle` is `false`.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\nusing .Example\n\nvehicles = [Car(), Motorcycle(), Bus(), Truck()]\nfor vehicle in vehicles\n    println(ispersonal(vehicle))\nend\n```\nThis will print `true`, `true`, `false`, and `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,250],"elapsed":3.511287486,"_type":"aimessage"}]
