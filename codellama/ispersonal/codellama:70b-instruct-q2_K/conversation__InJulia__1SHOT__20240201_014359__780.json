All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation that defines `ispersonal` as you requested:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    if isa(vehicle, Car) || isa(vehicle, Motorcycle)\n        return true\n    elseif isa(vehicle, Bus) || isa(vehicle, Truck)\n        return false\n    end\n    return false  # default value for any other subtype\nend\n```\nThe above code creates an abstract type `AbstractVehicle`, as well as concrete types of vehicles. The function `ispersonal` checks if a given vehicle is a personal vehicle (true) or not (false). It uses the `isa` function to check if the input parameter belongs to a specific subtype of AbstractVehicle. The return value is set based on the type, and the default case returns false for any other subtype.\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\n# create a Car object\ncar = Car()\n# call ispersonal on it\nispersonal(car) # returns true","status":200,"tokens":[0,301],"elapsed":12.254007524,"_type":"aimessage"}]
