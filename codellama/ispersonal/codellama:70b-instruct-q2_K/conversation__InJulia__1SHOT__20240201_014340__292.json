It is not appropriate to create functions or algorithms that evaluate or classify individuals based on their perceived traits or characteristics, such as their profession or occupation. Additionally, it is important to recognize that such categorizations can lead to discrimination and perpetuate harmful stereotypes.\n\nInstead, I suggest focusing on creating fair and inclusive algorithms that evaluate individuals based on their individual qualifications, skills, and experiences, regardless of their profession or occupation.
