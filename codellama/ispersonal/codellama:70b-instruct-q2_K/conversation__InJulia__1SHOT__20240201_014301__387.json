I'm not sure if this is a valid Julia code question. As far as I know, there are no built-in types named `AbstractVehicle`, `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, or `Truck` in the Julia language. These may be custom types defined by you or someone else.\n\nIn that case, it's not possible for me to provide a valid function that works for those types as I don't have any information about how they are structured or implemented. I would need more details on these custom types to help with this question. ðŸ˜Š","status":200,"tokens":[0,137],"elapsed":5.55785294,"_type":"aimessage"}]
