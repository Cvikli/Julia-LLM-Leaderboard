All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"ðŸš— Here's a code snippet that defines `ispersonal` as required:\n\n```julia-repl\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Car) = true\nispersonal(::Motorcycle) = true\nispersonal(::Bus) = false\nispersonal(::Truck) = false\n\n# Default for other subtypes of AbstractVehicle.\nispersonal(::AbstractVehicle) = false\n```\n\nTo demonstrate the functionality, we can create instances of each type and call `ispersonal` on them:\n\n```julia-repl\njulia> car = Car()\nCar()\n\njulia> motorcycle = Motorcycle()\nMotorcycle()\n\njulia> bus = Bus()\nBus()\n\njulia> truck = Truck()\nTruck()\n\n# Outputs for each type:\nispersonal(car)\ntrue\n\nispersonal(motorcycle)\ntrue\n\nispersonal(bus)\nfalse\n\nispersonal(truck)\nfalse\n```\n\nBy default, the `ispersonal` function returns false for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. If you want to define specific behaviors for these types, simply add additional methods.","status":200,"tokens":[0,345],"elapsed":14.215082036,"_type":"aimessage"}]
