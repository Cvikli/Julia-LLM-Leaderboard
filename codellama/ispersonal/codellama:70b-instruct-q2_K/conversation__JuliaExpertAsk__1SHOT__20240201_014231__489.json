All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The first two (Car and Motorcycle) will return true, the latter two (Bus and Truck) will return false. If an instance of a subclass of AbstractVehicle is passed that doesn't have a specific method defined for it, then the fallback function will be called and return false.","status":200,"tokens":[0,372],"elapsed":15.199647669,"_type":"aimessage"}]
