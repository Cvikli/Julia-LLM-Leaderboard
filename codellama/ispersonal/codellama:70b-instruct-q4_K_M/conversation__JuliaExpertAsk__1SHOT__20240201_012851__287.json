Then, we define the function `ispersonal` with a default value of `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.\n\nNext, we specialize the `ispersonal` function for the types `Car` and `Motorcycle`, returning `true` for those. Finally, we demonstrate how to use the `ispersonal` function with some example vehicles using the `test_ispersonal()` function. üöó‚úàÔ∏è","status":200,"tokens":[0,446],"elapsed":24.004483349,"_type":"aimessage"}]
