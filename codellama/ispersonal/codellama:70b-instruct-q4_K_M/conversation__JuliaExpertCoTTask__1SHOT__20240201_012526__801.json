All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Here is the solution to the problem:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\n# Function to check if the vehicle is personal or not. It returns a boolean value (true/false).\nfunction ispersonal(veh::AbstractVehicle)\n    return false  # Default behavior for all other subtypes of AbstractVehicle.\nend\n\n# Specialized methods for Car and Motorcycle, which are considered personal vehicles.\nispersonal(veh::Car) = true\nispersonal(veh::Motorcycle) = true\n\n# Example usage:\nprintln(\"ispersonal(Car()) is \", ispersonal(Car()))  # Output: true\n```\n\nIn this code, `AbstractVehicle` is the abstract supertype of all vehicles. We define specific subtypes for each vehicle type (`Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`). The function `ispersonal` checks if a given vehicle is personal or not. By default, it returns false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. However, we specialize the method to return true when checking a Car or Motorcycle. This means that the `ispersonal` function will return true for these two types and false for all others.","status":200,"tokens":[242,348],"elapsed":59.593484507,"_type":"aimessage"}]
