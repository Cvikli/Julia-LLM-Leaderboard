All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation that does what you asked:\n\n```julia-repl\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    if vehicle isa Union{Car,Motorcycle}\n        return true\n    elseif vehicle isa Union{Bus,Truck}\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n\n# example usage:\n\njulia> mycar = Car()\njulia> ispersonal(mycar)\ntrue\n```\nThis function works as follows. It first checks if the vehicle type provided (vehicle::AbstractVehicle) is of Union{Car,Motorcycle}. If it is a subtype of either of those, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false for all other cases. The Union function can be used to test whether an object is of multiple types.","status":200,"tokens":[0,248],"elapsed":13.321508691,"_type":"aimessage"}]
