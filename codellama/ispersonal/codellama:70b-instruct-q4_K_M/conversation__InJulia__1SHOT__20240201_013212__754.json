The `ispersonal()` function has a default behavior (returning `false`) for any subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, but it's also defined specifically to return `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle`. This ensures that we can identify personal vehicles while providing a fallback behavior for unanticipated types. ðŸš—","status":200,"tokens":[0,328],"elapsed":17.548683438,"_type":"aimessage"}]
