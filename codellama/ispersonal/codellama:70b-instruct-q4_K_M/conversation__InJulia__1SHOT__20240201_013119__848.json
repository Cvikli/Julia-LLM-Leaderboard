The function checks if its argument belongs to `Union{Car, Motorcycle}` type. If it does, then it returns true.\n\nIf the argument is not a car or motorcycle, then by default `false` will be returned, because of the last method definition. For other subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`, such as buses and trucks, the function explicitly returns false, because these vehicles are not suitable for everyday driving.","status":200,"tokens":[0,299],"elapsed":15.994194442,"_type":"aimessage"}]
