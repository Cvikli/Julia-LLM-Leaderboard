Here's how:\n\nStep 1: Think through our approach step by step.\nWe need to write a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. The function should work for types Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck, and default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.\n\nStep 2: Write any functions and other code we need.\nWe don't need any additional functions or code in this case, as our function `ispersonal` is a simple one-liner.\n\nStep 3: Solve the task.\nOur function should return true if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving and false otherwise. We can use Julia's multiple dispatch mechanism to define the function for each subtype of AbstractVehicle. Here's an example implementation:\n```julia\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    return false\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::Car)\n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::Motorcycle)\n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::Bus)\n    return false\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::Truck)\n    return false\nend\n```\nStep 4: Check that our solution is correct.\nWe can test our function by calling it with different types of vehicles and checking the output. For example:\n```julia\n@assert ispersonal(Car()) == true\n@assert ispersonal(Motorcycle()) == true\n@assert ispersonal(Bus()) == false\n@assert ispersonal(Truck()) == false\n```\nThis tests our function with the given types and checks that it returns the expected output.\n\nConclusion:\nWe have followed a systematic approach to solve this problem by thinking through our steps, writing any necessary code, solving the task, and checking that our solution is correct. Our implementation of `ispersonal` uses Julia's multiple dispatch mechanism to define the function for each subtype of AbstractVehicle, which makes it easy to add more types in the future.","status":200,"tokens":[0,516],"elapsed":14.691557053,"_type":"aimessage"}]
