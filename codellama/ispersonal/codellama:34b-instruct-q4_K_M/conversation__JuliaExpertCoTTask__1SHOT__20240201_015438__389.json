All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem, we can use a combination of type assertions and conditional statements in Julia. Here's one possible implementation:\n```julia\nusing AbstractVehicles\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    # Check if the vehicle is a Car or Motorcycle\n    if vehicle isa Car || vehicle isa Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif vehicle isa Bus || vehicle isa Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        # Default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this implementation, we first check if the `vehicle` parameter is a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`, and return `true` in those cases. Otherwise, we check if it's a `Bus` or a `Truck`, and return `false` in those cases. Finally, we default to returning `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n```julia\ncar = Car()\nmotorcycle = Motorcycle()\nbus = Bus()\ntruck = Truck()\n\nprintln(ispersonal(car))  # true\nprintln(ispersonal(motorcycle))  # true\nprintln(ispersonal(bus))  # false\nprintln(ispersonal(truck))  # false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,315],"elapsed":8.921120066,"_type":"aimessage"}]
