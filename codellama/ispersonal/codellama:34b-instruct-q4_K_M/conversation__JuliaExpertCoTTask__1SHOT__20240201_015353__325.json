All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we can use a dispatcher method that checks the type of the input vehicle and returns a trait based on whether it is a personal vehicle or not. Here's an implementation in Julia:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::AbstractVehicle) = false # default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle\nispersonal(::Car) = true\nispersonal(::Motorcycle) = true\nispersonal(::Bus) = false\nispersonal(::Truck) = false\n```\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n```\nNote that we've defined a default method for `ispersonal` that returns `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. This ensures that the function works correctly even if new subtypes of `AbstractVehicle` are added in the future.","status":200,"tokens":[0,307],"elapsed":8.698568717,"_type":"aimessage"}]
