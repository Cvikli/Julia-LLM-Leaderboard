All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the `ispersonal` function:\n```\nispersonal(::Type{<:AbstractVehicle}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Bus}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{Truck}) = false\n```\nThis function takes a type as an argument and returns `true` if the type is a subtype of `AbstractVehicle` and represents a personal vehicle for everyday driving, which is the case for `Car` and `Motorcycle`. Otherwise, it returns `false`. The default value for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle` is also set to `false`.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,243],"elapsed":6.747406124,"_type":"aimessage"}]
