All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an implementation of the `ispersonal` function that follows the given Task and uses the provided Data:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    return vehicle isa Union{Car, Motorcycle}\nend\n\n@assert ispersonal(Car()) == true\n@assert ispersonal(Motorcycle()) == true\n@assert ispersonal(Bus()) == false\n@assert ispersonal(Truck()) == false\n```\nExplanation:\n\n1. The function `ispersonal` takes an argument of type `AbstractVehicle`. This allows the function to work with any subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, including `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`.\n2. The function uses a type union `Union{Car, Motorcycle}` to check if the provided vehicle is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. If the vehicle is not in this union, the function returns false by default.\n3. The function is tested with examples of `Car` and `Motorcycle`, which should return true, and `Bus` and `Truck`, which should return false.\n4. The `@assert` statements are used to check that the function returns the expected values for each example. If any of the assertions fail, an error is thrown.","status":200,"tokens":[235,347],"elapsed":30.568055751,"_type":"aimessage"}]
