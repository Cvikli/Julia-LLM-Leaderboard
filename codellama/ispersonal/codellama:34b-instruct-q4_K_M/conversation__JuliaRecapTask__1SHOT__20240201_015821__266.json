[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving.

The function first checks if the vehicle is either a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`, and returns `true` in that case. If the vehicle is not a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`, it then checks if it is a `Bus` or a `Truck`, and returns `false` in that case. Finally, for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, the function returns `false`.\n\nNote that the function uses multiple dispatch to handle different types of vehicles. The `isa` keyword is used to check if an object is a specific type, and it is more efficient than using `typeof(vehicle) == Car` or `typeof(vehicle) == Motorcycle`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,397],"elapsed":11.347947398,"_type":"aimessage"}]
