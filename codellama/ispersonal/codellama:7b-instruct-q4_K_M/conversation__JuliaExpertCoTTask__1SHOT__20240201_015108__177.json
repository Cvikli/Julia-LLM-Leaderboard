All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

We also define a function `ispersonal` that takes an object of type `AbstractVehicle` as input and returns `true` if the vehicle is a personal vehicle, and `false` otherwise.\n\nFor each concrete subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, we define an overload of the `ispersonal` function that returns `true`. For example, for `Car`, we define `function ispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true`. This means that if the input to `ispersonal` is a `Car`, then it will return `true`.\n\nFinally, we define a default implementation of `ispersonal` that returns `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. This is done using a catch-all clause in the function signature: `function ispersonal(::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle} = false`.\n\nHere is an example usage of the `ispersonal` function:\n```\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,472],"elapsed":4.135780062,"_type":"aimessage"}]
