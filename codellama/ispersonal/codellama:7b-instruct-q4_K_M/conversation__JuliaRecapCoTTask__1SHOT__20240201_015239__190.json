[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving.

Define a new type `PersonalVehicle` that is a subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. This type will represent personal vehicles for everyday driving.\n2. Write a function `ispersonal(v::AbstractVehicle)::Bool` that takes an `AbstractVehicle` as input and returns `true` if the vehicle is a personal vehicle, and `false` otherwise.\n3. The function should default to `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.\n\nHere's an example implementation:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct PersonalVehicle <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(v::AbstractVehicle)::Bool\n    return false\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(v::PersonalVehicle)::Bool\n    return true\nend\n```\nIn this example, the function `ispersonal` is defined to default to `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. However, if the input is a `PersonalVehicle`, it returns `true`.\n\nNote that we have also defined a new type `PersonalVehicle` that is a subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. This type represents personal vehicles for everyday driving. We can use this type to distinguish between personal and non-personal vehicles.","status":200,"tokens":[0,357],"elapsed":3.173720426,"_type":"aimessage"}]
