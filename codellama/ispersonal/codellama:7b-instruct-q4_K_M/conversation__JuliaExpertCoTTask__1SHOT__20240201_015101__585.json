For all other subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`, it returns `false`.\n* To provide an example, we can create a few instances of the different types of vehicles and call the function with each one:\n```\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,337],"elapsed":2.932250577,"_type":"aimessage"}]
