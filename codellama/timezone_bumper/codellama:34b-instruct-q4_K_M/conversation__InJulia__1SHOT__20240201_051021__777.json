Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example implementation of the `timezone_bumper` function in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    # Check if the input is a DateTime type\n    if !isa(dt, DateTime)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be of type DateTime\"))\n    end\n\n    # Increase the timestamp by `bump` hours\n    new_dt = dt + Hour(bump)\n\n    return new_dt\nend\n```\nThis function takes two arguments: `dt`, which is the input datetime, and `bump`, which is an optional integer that specifies the number of hours to increase the timestamp by. The default value for `bump` is 3.\n\nThe function first checks if the input `dt` is a `DateTime` type. If it's not, it throws an `ArgumentError`.\n\nNext, the function increases the timestamp by `bump` hours using the `+` operator between two `DateTime` objects. This creates a new `DateTime` object with the increased timestamp.\n\nFinally, the function returns the new `DateTime` object as the result of the function call.","status":200,"tokens":[0,268],"elapsed":7.533158124,"_type":"aimessage"}]
