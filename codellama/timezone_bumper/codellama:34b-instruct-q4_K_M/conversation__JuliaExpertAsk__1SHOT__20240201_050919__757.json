It returns a new DateTime object that is the original datetime plus the specified number of hours.\n\nNote that this function throws an error if the input argument `dt` is a Date type, since we cannot add hours to a date without specifying the time zone information.","status":200,"tokens":[103,130],"elapsed":3.841618227,"_type":"aimessage"}]
