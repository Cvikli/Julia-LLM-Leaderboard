The default value for `bump` is set to 3, which means that the function will increase the provided timestamp by 3 hours if no other value is specified. Also, the function only works with `DateTime` types and throws an error for `Date` types.","status":200,"tokens":[0,125],"elapsed":3.466033392,"_type":"aimessage"}]
