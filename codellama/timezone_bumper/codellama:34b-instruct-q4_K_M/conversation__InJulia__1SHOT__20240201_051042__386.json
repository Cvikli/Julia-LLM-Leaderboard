Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the code:\n```\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nIn this function, we take two arguments `dt` and `bump`. The first argument `dt` is the timestamp to be increased, which can be a DateTime type or a Date type. The second argument `bump` is an integer that represents the number of hours to increase the timestamp by. If no value is provided for `bump`, it defaults to 3.\n\nInside the function, we use the `+` operator to add the number of hours represented by `bump` to the timestamp. We then return the resulting DateTime object.\n\nHere's an example usage of this function:\n```\njulia> dt = Dates.DateTime(2023, 1, 1)\n2023-01-01T00:00:00\n\njulia> timezone_bumper(dt, 5)\n2023-01-01T05:00:00\n```\nIn this example, we create a DateTime object `dt` representing January 1st, 2023 at midnight. We then pass it and the number of hours to increase the timestamp by (5) to the `timezone_bumper` function. The function returns a new DateTime object with the updated timestamp.","status":200,"tokens":[0,325],"elapsed":9.140641787,"_type":"aimessage"}]
