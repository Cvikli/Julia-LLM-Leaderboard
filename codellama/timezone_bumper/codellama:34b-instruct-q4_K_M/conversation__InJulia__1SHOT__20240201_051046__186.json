If it is not, an error is thrown using the `throw()` method.\n\nIf the input is a valid DateTime object, the function uses the `Dates.Hour()` method to add `bump` hours to the timestamp and returns the resulting DateTime object.","status":200,"tokens":[0,162],"elapsed":4.538029816,"_type":"aimessage"}]
