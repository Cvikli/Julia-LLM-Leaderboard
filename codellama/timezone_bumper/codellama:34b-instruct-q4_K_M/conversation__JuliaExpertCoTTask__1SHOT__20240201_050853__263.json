[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n\nHere is a Julia function that implements the `timezone_bumper` task:\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    # Check if dt is a DateTime type\n    if !isa(dt, DateTime)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"dt must be a DateTime\"))\n    end\n    # Add bump hours to dt\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n# Explanation\n\nThe `timezone_bumper` function takes two arguments: `dt`, which is the timestamp to be increased, and `bump`, which is the number of hours to increase the timestamp by (defaults to 3). The function first checks if `dt` is a DateTime type using the `isa` function. If it's not, an ArgumentError is thrown.\n\nIf `dt` is a DateTime type, the function adds the specified number of hours to `dt` using the `Hour` constructor and returns the resulting timestamp.","status":200,"tokens":[0,227],"elapsed":6.379145054,"_type":"aimessage"}]
