We can use the `+` operator to add an hour to the date, like this: `dt + Dates.Hour(1)`\n* To make the function more flexible, we've added a default value for the `bump` parameter of 3 hours. This means that if you call the function without specifying a value for `bump`, it will default to adding 3 hours to the date.\n* We've also added an error check to make sure that the function only works with `DateTime` types and throws an error if you try to use it with a `Date` type. This is because the `+` operator is not defined for `Date` types, so we need to handle this case explicitly.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n```julia\njulia> dt = DateTime(2023, 1, 1)\n2023-01-01T00:00:00\n\njulia> timezone_bumper(dt)\n2023-01-01T03:00:00\n\njulia> dt = Date(2023, 1, 1)\nError: MethodError: no method matching +(::Date, ::Int64)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,371],"elapsed":10.31914324,"_type":"aimessage"}]
