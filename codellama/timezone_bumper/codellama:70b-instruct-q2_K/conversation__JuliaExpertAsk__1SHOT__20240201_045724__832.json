If an argument of type Date is passed, it throws an error as dates don't have timezones. The `TimeZone` module needs to be imported for this function to work.\n\nPlease note that you can extend the function to handle multiple types by adding a series of `elseif` statements. You could also add a catch-all statement to capture and handle unexpected input types.","status":200,"tokens":[0,175],"elapsed":7.140526581,"_type":"aimessage"}]
