[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

It adds the specified number of hours to the given date and time, then returns the result.\n\n2. **Type Check**: Before performing any calculations or operations on `dt`, we'll perform a type check to ensure that it is a DateTime object. If not, an error will be thrown.\n```julia\nif !isa(dt, DateTime)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"timezone_bumper() only works with DateTime objects.\"))\nend\n```\n3. **Bump**: In the event that `bump` is set to a non-integer value, an error will be thrown.\n```julia\nif !isa(bump, Int)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"Timezone bump must be an integer.\"))\nend\n```\n4. **Output**: The final result of the function is returned as a DateTime object, with the specified number of hours added to it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,283],"elapsed":11.711289318,"_type":"aimessage"}]
