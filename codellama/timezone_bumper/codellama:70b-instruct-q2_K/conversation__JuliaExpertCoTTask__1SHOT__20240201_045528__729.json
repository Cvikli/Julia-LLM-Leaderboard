The default bump value is 3 hours, but you can change it as needed.\n\nHere's how it works in practice:\n\n```julia-repl\n# Default example\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0))\n```\nOutput:\n```julia-repl\n2023-04-10T15:00:00\n```\n```julia-repl\n# Custom example with a different bump value\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),5)\n```\nOutput:\n```julia-repl\n2023-04-10T17:00:00\n```\nThe function handles Date objects by throwing an error. This is intentional and can be useful if you don't want to accidentally change the date.","status":200,"tokens":[0,396],"elapsed":16.289796238,"_type":"aimessage"}]
