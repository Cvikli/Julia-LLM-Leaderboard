Here's the code: 👇\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt, bump=3)\n    if typeof(dt) != DateTime\n        throw(\"Please provide a valid DateTime object.\")\n    end\n    \n    new_dt = dt + Hour(bump)\n\n    return new_dt\nend\n```\n\nAnd here's how it works: 💻\n\n1. The function takes two arguments, `dt` and `bump`. It defaults to adding 3 hours if no bump is provided. 🕑\n2. The first step checks the type of the input variable `dt`. If it's not a DateTime object, an error message gets thrown. 📝\n3. Then, it creates a new timestamp called `new_dt` by adding the bump value to the original timestamp (`dt`). ➕\n4. Finally, it returns the new time, which will be displayed in your console. 💡\n\nNow you're ready for action! Get bumptiming with this new function. 🎉","status":200,"tokens":[0,272],"elapsed":11.088630394,"_type":"aimessage"}]
