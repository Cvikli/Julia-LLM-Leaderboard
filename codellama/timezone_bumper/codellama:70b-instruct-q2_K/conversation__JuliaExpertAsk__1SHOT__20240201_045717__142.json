It returns a new `DateTime` instance with the added time. If an instance of `Date` is passed in, it throws an error since you only want this function to work on `DateTime`.\n\nPlease note that the `bump` parameter can be any positive or negative integer value and not just 3 hours as specified in your initial request. You could also make it a keyword argument if you wanted to allow for more flexibility.","status":200,"tokens":[0,201],"elapsed":8.17104794,"_type":"aimessage"}]
