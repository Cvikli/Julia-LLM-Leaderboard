If it's a `Date`, an error is thrown. If it's a `DateTime`, then `bump` hours are added to it, which creates a new DateTime object called `newTime`. The function returns the value of `newTime`.\n\nNote: I included the `using Dates` line at the top of the code to load the Julia Dates module. If you've already loaded the module in your current session, you can remove that line from the function definition.","status":200,"tokens":[0,223],"elapsed":11.932656624,"_type":"aimessage"}]
