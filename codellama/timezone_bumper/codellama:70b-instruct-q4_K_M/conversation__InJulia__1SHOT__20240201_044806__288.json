Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"1. First, we need to import the `Dates` package to work with dates and times in Julia:\n```Julia\nusing Dates\n```\n2. The next step is to define our function:\n```Julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump=3)\n```\nThis allows us to pass two arguments into the `timezone_bumper` function - one for a date and time (as a `DateTime`) and one for a number of hours to bump by (with a default value of 3).\n\n3. We then use an if-else statement to check whether the passed argument is a `Date`, which would not be compatible with our function, or a `DateTime`:\n```Julia\nif typeof(dt) == Date\n    error(\"Argument must be a DateTime object.\")\nelseif typeof(dt) == DateTime\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n4. If the argument is a `Date`, we throw an error to let the user know that it's not compatible with our function. However, if it's a `DateTime`, we bump its hour by the value of `bump` using `dt + Hour(bump)` and return the new, bumped time.\n```Julia\nend\n```\n5. Finally, we can test our function with various date and time inputs:\n```Julia\ndt1 = DateTime(\"2022-03-16T12:00:00\") # A DateTime object\ndt2 = Date(2022, 3, 16)              # A Date object (not compatible with our function)\n\ntimezone_bumper(dt1)                 # Adds three hours to dt1 by default\ntimezone_bumper(dt1, 4)              # Adds four hours instead of the default\ntimezone_bumper(dt2)                 # Throws an error since dt2 is a Date, not a DateTime.","status":200,"tokens":[0,439],"elapsed":23.74499314,"_type":"aimessage"}]
