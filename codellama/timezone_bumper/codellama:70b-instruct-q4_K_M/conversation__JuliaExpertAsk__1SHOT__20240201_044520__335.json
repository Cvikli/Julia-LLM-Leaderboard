If not, throw an error.\n    if !isa(dt, DateTime)\n        throw(\"Timezone_bumper only works for DateTime types\")\n    end\n    # Add the number of hours in bump to dt and return it as a result.\n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nThis function takes two arguments: `dt` is the timestamp you want to increase, which must be a DateTime type; `bump` is an optional argument that specifies the number of hours by which you want to increase `dt`. If you don't specify `bump`, it defaults to 3.\n\nIf `dt` is not a DateTime object, this function throws an error. Otherwise, it increases the timestamp by `bump` hours and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,245],"elapsed":13.129433427,"_type":"aimessage"}]
