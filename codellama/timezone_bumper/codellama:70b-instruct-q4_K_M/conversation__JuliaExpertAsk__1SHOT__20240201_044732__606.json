Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"This is the code I came up with:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt, bump = 3)\n    # Check that the input is of type DateTime\n    if typeof(dt) != DateTime\n        throw(DomainError(\"Input must be of type DateTime\"))\n    end\n\n    # Increase the timestamp by bump hours (defaults to +3 hours)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of what this function does:\n\n1.  **Type check**: It first checks that `dt` is of type `DateTime`. If not, it throws a `DomainError`, which is an appropriate error for this situation since we only want to accept `DateTime` inputs.\n2.  **Hour bump**: If the input is of type `DateTime`, it adds `bump` hours (defaults to +3) to the timestamp using Julia's built-in date/time arithmetic capabilities. The `Hour(bump)` function converts `bump` into a `Period` object, which can be added directly to a `DateTime`.\n\nTo use this function, you would simply pass in the desired DateTime and optionally provide a bump value:\n\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(\"2019-10-31T14:56\")  # Your input DateTime\nbumped_time = timezone_bumper(dt)   # Defaults to +3 hours\n# Output: 2019-10-31T17:56:00.000\n```\n\nIf you want to use a different bump value, just provide it as the second argument:\n\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(\"2019-10-31T14:56\")  # Your input DateTime\nbumped_time = timezone_bumper(dt, 7)   # Increases by +7 hours\n# Output: 2019-10-31T21:56:00.000\n```\n\nI hope this meets your requirements! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.","status":200,"tokens":[0,494],"elapsed":26.556095293,"_type":"aimessage"}]
