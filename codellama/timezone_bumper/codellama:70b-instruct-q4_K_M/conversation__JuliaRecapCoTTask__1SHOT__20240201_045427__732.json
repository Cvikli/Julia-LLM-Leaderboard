[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

Please provide a DateTime object.\")\n    end\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nIn this program:\n\n1.  `function timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump=3)` declares the function `timezone_bumper` and specifies that it takes two arguments, `dt` (of type `DateTime`) and `bump` (which has a default value of 3). The function also specifies its return type as `DateTime`.\n2.  `if typeof(dt) == Date` checks if the provided timestamp is of type `Date`, in which case an error is thrown using the `throw()` function. This ensures that only timestamps with a date and time are accepted by the function.\n3.  Finally, `return dt + Hour(bump)` adds the specified number of hours to the provided timestamp and returns it as the result of the function.\n\nNote: I have added an instruction to ensure that the function only works for DateTime types.
