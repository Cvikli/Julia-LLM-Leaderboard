Check if the input type is Date or DateTime using `isa`. If it's not DateTime, throw an error:\n4. Use the `+` operator to calculate the new time by adding `bump` hours:\n5. Return the updated timestamp as a DateTime object.\nHere's the complete code:\n```julia\nusing Dates # Import the necessary package\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt, bump::Int=3)\n    if !isa(dt, DateTime)  # Check if dt is not DateTime and throw an error\n        error(\"This function only works with DateTime types\")\n    end\n    \n    new_time = dt + Hour(bump)  # Add the number of hours to the input timestamp\n\n    return new_time  # Return the updated time as a DateTime object\nend\n```\nNote: This code assumes that you have already imported the Dates package. If not, add `using Dates` at the beginning of your script before defining the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,291],"elapsed":15.637076684,"_type":"aimessage"}]
