Checking input type (DateTime or Date): If the input is of type `Date`, we'll throw an error to ensure that only `DateTime` objects are accepted.\n 2.

Addition of hours to datetime: We add the number of hours in `bump` to the provided `DateTime` object, effectively increasing it.\nHere's an example implementation:\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    if typeof(dt) == Date\n        error(\"Only DateTime objects are accepted.\")\n    elseif typeof(dt) == DateTime\n        return dt + Hour(bump)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function will increase any provided `DateTime` object by the specified number of hours. If a `Date` object is provided, it will throw an error.","status":200,"tokens":[0,219],"elapsed":11.728469854,"_type":"aimessage"}]
