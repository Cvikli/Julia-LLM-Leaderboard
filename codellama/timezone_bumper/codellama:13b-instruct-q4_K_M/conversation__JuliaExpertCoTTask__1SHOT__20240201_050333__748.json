[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)::DateTime\n    if dt isa DateTime\n        return dt + Hour(bump)\n    elseif dt isa Date\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Cannot increase a Date by $(bump) hours.\"))\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function takes in two arguments: `dt` and `bump`. The first argument `dt` must be of type `DateTime`, while the second argument `bump` is optional and defaults to 3.\n\nThe function checks if `dt` is a `DateTime` or a `Date`. If it's a `DateTime`, it adds `bump` hours to it using the `Hour` constructor, which creates a new `Duration` object representing a number of hours. The resulting `DateTime` object is then returned.\n\nIf `dt` is a `Date`, an `ArgumentError` is thrown, indicating that increasing a `Date` by `bump` hours is not supported.\n\nFor example, calling the function with `timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)` would result in `DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 15, 0)`, while calling it with `timezone_bumper(Date(2023, 4, 10))` would throw an error.","status":200,"tokens":[0,321],"elapsed":4.319635336,"_type":"aimessage"}]
