We set the default value of `bump` to 3 hours, which means that if no argument is provided for `bump`, it will increase the timestamp by 3 hours.\n\nWe then check if `dt` is a `DateTime` type using the `isa` keyword. If it's not a `DateTime` type, we throw an error using the `throw` function with the message \"dt must be a DateTime type\". Otherwise, we return the result of adding `bump` hours to `dt`.\n\nNote that this function is designed for use with `DateTime` types and will not work with `Date` types. If you need to work with `Date` types as well, you can modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,236],"elapsed":3.133980263,"_type":"aimessage"}]
