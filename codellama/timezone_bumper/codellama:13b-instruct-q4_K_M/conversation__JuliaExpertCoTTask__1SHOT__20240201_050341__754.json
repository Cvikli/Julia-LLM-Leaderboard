If no `bump` argument is provided, it defaults to 3. The function checks whether `dt` is a DateTime object or not using the `typeof` function. If it is not a DateTime object, it throws a MethodError. Otherwise, it returns the result of adding `bump` hours to `dt`.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\njulia> timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)\n2023-04-10T15:00:00\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,251],"elapsed":3.375262155,"_type":"aimessage"}]
