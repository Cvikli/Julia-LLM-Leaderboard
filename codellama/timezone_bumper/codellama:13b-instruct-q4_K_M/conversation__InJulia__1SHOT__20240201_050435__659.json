Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the code:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt, bump = 3)\n    if !(dt isa DateTime)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Only DateTime objects can be used with this function\"))\n    end\n    \n    dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nIn the code above, I've defined a function called `timezone_bumper` that takes two arguments: `dt`, which is a DateTime object, and an optional argument `bump`, which defaults to 3. The function first checks if `dt` is not of type DateTime, it throws an error. Then, it adds the value of `bump` (which is in hours) to the timestamp using the `Hour` constructor. Finally, it returns the new timestamp with the increased hour.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n```julia\njulia> dt = DateTime(2022, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0)\n2022-01-01T00:00:00\n\njulia> timezone_bumper(dt)\n2022-01-01T03:00:00\n```\nIn the example above, I've created a DateTime object for January 1st, 2022 at midnight. Then, I called the `timezone_bumper` function with that DateTime object as an argument and it increased the timestamp by 3 hours (which is the default value of `bump`).\n\nYou can also use the optional argument to increase or decrease the hour by a different amount:\n```julia\njulia> dt = DateTime(2022, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0)\n2022-01-01T00:00:00\n\njulia> timezone_bumper(dt, -3)\n2021-12-31T21:00:00\n```\nIn the example above, I've called the `timezone_bumper` function with the DateTime object and passed a negative value for `bump`, which decreases the hour by 3.","status":200,"tokens":[0,507],"elapsed":6.749461276,"_type":"aimessage"}]
