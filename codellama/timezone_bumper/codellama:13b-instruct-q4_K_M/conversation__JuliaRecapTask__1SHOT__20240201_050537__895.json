[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt, bump = 3)\n    if typeof(dt) <: DateTime\n        return dt + Hour(bump)\n    elseif typeof(dt) <: Date\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"timezone_bumper is only defined for DateTime types\"))\n    end\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\nThe function `timezone_bumper` takes two arguments, `dt` and `bump`. The first argument is any timestamp, while the second argument is an integer that represents the number of hours to add. By default, the bump value is set to 3 hours.\n\nThe function checks the type of the input argument using the `typeof()` method. If the type is `DateTime`, it returns the result of adding the `bump` hours to the input timestamp using the `+` operator. If the type is `Date`, an error is thrown using the `throw()` function.\n\nThe `Hour` keyword is used to specify that we are working with a time unit, not just an integer value. This ensures that the operation is properly interpreted as a date-time addition.","status":200,"tokens":[0,253],"elapsed":3.445241171,"_type":"aimessage"}]
