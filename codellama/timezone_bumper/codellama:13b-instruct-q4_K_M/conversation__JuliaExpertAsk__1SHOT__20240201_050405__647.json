If `dt` is a `Date` type, an error is thrown. Otherwise, a new `DateTime` object is created with the increased timestamp.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\njulia> dt = DateTime(2019, 1, 1)\nDateTime(\"2019-01-01T00:00:00\")\n\njulia> timezone_bumper(dt)\nDateTime(\"2019-01-01T03:00:00\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,231],"elapsed":3.073827518,"_type":"aimessage"}]
