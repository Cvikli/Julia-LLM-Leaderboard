[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a solution using the Julia language:\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    if dt isa DateTime\n        return dt + Hour(bump)\n    elseif dt isa Date\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"timezone_bumper does not support Date types\"))\n    end\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* The function `timezone_bumper` takes two arguments: `dt`, which must be of type `DateTime`, and an optional argument `bump`, which defaults to 3.\n* We use the `isa` keyword to check if `dt` is a `DateTime`. If it's not, we throw an `ArgumentError` indicating that the function does not support `Date` types.\n* If `dt` is a `DateTime`, we return its value increased by `bump` hours using the `Hour` constructor from the `Dates` module.\n\nNote: I've used the `isa` keyword to check if an object is of a specific type, rather than using `typeof(dt) == DateTime`. This is because the `isa` keyword is more concise and also works for subtypes of `DateTime`, such as `ZonedDateTime` or `TimeZone`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,283],"elapsed":3.868085028,"_type":"aimessage"}]
