The function first checks if `dt` is a Date type by using the `typeof()` function. If it is, it throws an error. Otherwise, it adds `bump` hours to the DateTime object using the `Dates.Hour()` constructor and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,164],"elapsed":2.178307913,"_type":"aimessage"}]
