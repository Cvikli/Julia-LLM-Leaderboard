The function first checks that the input is a DateTime type using the `typeof()` function. If it is not, an error is thrown using the `ArgumentError()` function.\n\nIf the input is a DateTime type, then the function simply adds the number of hours specified in `bump` to the timestamp using the `Dates.Hour()` function. The resulting value is then returned as a new DateTime object.","status":200,"tokens":[0,196],"elapsed":2.601123811,"_type":"aimessage"}]
