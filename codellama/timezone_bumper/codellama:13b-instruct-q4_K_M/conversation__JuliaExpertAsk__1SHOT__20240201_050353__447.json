Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    if dt isa Date\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Can't bump a Date type\"))\n    end\n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nThis function takes two arguments: `dt`, which is the DateTime object to be bumped, and `bump`, which is an optional argument that defaults to 3 hours if not provided. The function first checks that `dt` is a DateTime type by using the `isa` method, and throws an error if it's not. Then, it creates a new DateTime object with the same date and time as `dt` but with the hour value increased by `bump` hours. Finally, it returns this new DateTime object.\n\nThis function is useful when you need to increment or decrement a timestamp by a fixed amount of hours, without having to worry about the details of how to do so in Julia. It's also a good example of how to write a function that can handle different types of input, such as DateTime and Date, using the `isa` method.","status":200,"tokens":[103,250],"elapsed":3.395873048,"_type":"aimessage"}]
