[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt, bump = 3)\n    if typeof(dt) == DateTime && !isnan(dt)\n        return dt + Hour(bump)\n    elseif typeof(dt) == Date\n        throw(DomainError(\"timezone_bumper does not support Date types\"))\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `typeof` function to check whether the input `dt` is a `DateTime`. If it is, it returns the result of adding `bump` hours to it using the `+` operator and the `Hour` type from the `Dates` standard library. The `isnan` function is used to ensure that the input is not `NaN`, which would cause an error when trying to add hours to it.\n\nIf the input is a `Date`, the function throws a `DomainError`. This is because adding hours to a `Date` type is not valid, and attempting to do so would result in unexpected behavior.\n\nThe function also has a default argument for the `bump` parameter, which defaults to 3 if no value is provided. This allows users to call the function without providing any arguments, which will increase the time by 3 hours.","status":200,"tokens":[0,268],"elapsed":3.682805094,"_type":"aimessage"}]
