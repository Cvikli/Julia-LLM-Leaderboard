[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the function that meets all the requirements:\n```scss\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* The function takes two arguments: `dt` which is a DateTime object and `bump` which is an integer that represents the number of hours to add to the original timestamp. If no value is provided for `bump`, it defaults to 3 hours.\n* The function uses type annotation to ensure that only DateTime objects are accepted as input, and any other type will result in a type error.\n* The function uses the `+` operator to add the number of hours specified by `bump` to the original timestamp. The `Hour` function is used to convert the integer into a Duration object, which can be added to a DateTime object.\n* The function returns the new timestamp with the desired bump.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```scss\njulia> d = DateTime(2023, 5, 15, 14, 0, 0)\n2023-05-15T14:00:00\n\njulia> timezone_bumper(d, 2)\n2023-05-15T16:00:00\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,308],"elapsed":2.759387209,"_type":"aimessage"}]
