The `+` operator is overloaded for the `DateTime` type, so it can be used to add hours, minutes, or seconds to a `DateTime` object. In this case, we're adding 3 hours to the `dt` argument using the `Dates.Hour` constructor.\n\nTo check that the function works as expected, you can use the following code:\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)\nbump = 3\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, bump)\n@assert new_dt == dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,219],"elapsed":1.838054028,"_type":"aimessage"}]
