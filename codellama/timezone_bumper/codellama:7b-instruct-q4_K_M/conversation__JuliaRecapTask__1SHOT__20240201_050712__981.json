[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

If it's not a `DateTime`, the function throws an error.\n* Then, the function uses the `+` operator to add the number of hours specified in `bump` to the timestamp. The `Dates.Hour()` method is used to specify the units of the addition (in this case, hours).\n* Finally, the function returns the modified timestamp.\n\nNote that the `timezone_bumper` function assumes that the input timestamp is in UTC time zone, and it adds the specified number of hours to the timestamp without considering any other time zones. If you need to consider a different time zone, you'll need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,277],"elapsed":2.543456272,"_type":"aimessage"}]
