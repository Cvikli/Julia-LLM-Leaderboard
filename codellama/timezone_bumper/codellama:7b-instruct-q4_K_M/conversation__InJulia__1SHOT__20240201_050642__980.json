The `timezone_bumper` function takes two arguments:\n\n* `dt`: A DateTime object representing the timestamp to be bumped.\n* `bump`: An optional Int argument specifying the number of hours by which to bump the timestamp (defaults to 3).\n\nThe function returns a new DateTime object with the specified number of hours added to it, using the `+` operator for DateTimes. The `Hour` type is used to represent the amount of time to be bumped as an Int.\n\nNote that this function only works for DateTime types and will throw an error if the input argument is a Date type.","status":200,"tokens":[0,223],"elapsed":1.850496949,"_type":"aimessage"}]
