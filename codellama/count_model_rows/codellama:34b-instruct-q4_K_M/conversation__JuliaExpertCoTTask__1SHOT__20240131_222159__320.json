The function `count_model_rows` takes a DataFrame as input and returns a vector of integers, where each integer represents the number of rows in the corresponding group.\n2. We first group the data by model using the `groupby` function. This creates a new DataFrame with one row for each unique value of `model`.\n3. Next, we use the `map` function to apply a function to each row of the grouped DataFrame. The function calculates the number of rows in each group and returns an integer.\n4. Finally, we return the vector of counts.\n\nHere is an example usage of the function:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(counts)  # [3, 1, 2]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,306],"elapsed":8.547144396,"_type":"aimessage"}]
