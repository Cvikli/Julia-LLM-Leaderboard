For example:\n```\ndf_cars = DataFrame(:model => [\"Toyota\", \"Honda\", \"Ford\", \"Toyota\", \"Honda\", \"Ford\"], :year => [2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020])\n\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars, :model)\n```\nThis will return a dictionary with the number of rows for each `model` value in the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,275],"elapsed":7.672420773,"_type":"aimessage"}]
