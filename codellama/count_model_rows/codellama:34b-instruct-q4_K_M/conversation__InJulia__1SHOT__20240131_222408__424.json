The function uses the `groupby` method to group the rows of the DataFrame by the values in the specified column, and then calculates the number of rows for each group using the `size()` method.\n\nHere's an example of how you could use this function:\n```\ndf = DataFrame(model=[\"Toyota\", \"Honda\", \"Ford\", \"Toyota\"], year=[2018, 2017, 2019, 2016])\ncount_model_rows(df, :model)\n```\nThis would output the following DataFrame:\n```\n3×2 DataFrame\n Row │ model      count\n     │ String     Int64\n─────┼───────────────────\n   1 │ Toyota        2\n   2 │ Honda         1\n   3 │ Ford          1\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,294],"elapsed":8.204269957,"_type":"aimessage"}]
