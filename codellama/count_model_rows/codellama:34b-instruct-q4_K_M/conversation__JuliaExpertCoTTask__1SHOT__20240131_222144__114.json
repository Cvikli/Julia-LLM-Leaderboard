The function uses the `countmap` function from the `DataFrames` package to calculate the counts.\n\nThe code also includes an example usage of the function, where it is applied to a DataFrame with the same structure as the one provided in the task description.","status":200,"tokens":[0,223],"elapsed":6.231874444,"_type":"aimessage"}]
