It then uses the `combine` function to apply the `length` function to each group, which returns the number of rows in each group. The resulting dictionary maps model names to their corresponding row counts.\n\nYou can call this function on your DataFrame `df_cars` like this:\n```\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,152],"elapsed":4.232436283,"_type":"aimessage"}]
