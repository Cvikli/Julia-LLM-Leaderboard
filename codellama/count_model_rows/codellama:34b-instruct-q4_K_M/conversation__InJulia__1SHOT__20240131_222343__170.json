Here is an example of how you could do this:\n```\nusing DataFrames\n\n# Create a sample DataFrame with columns 'model' and 'price'\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model = [\"Toyota\", \"Ford\", \"Chevrolet\", \"Honda\"], price = [22000, 25000, 27000, 32000])\n\n# Define a function that groups data by 'model' and calculates the number of rows for each group\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    # Use the `groupby` function to group data by 'model'\n    g = groupby(df, :model)\n    \n    # Calculate the number of rows for each group using the `nrow` function\n    return DataFrame(model = names(g), nrows = map(x -> length(x), g))\nend\n\n# Call the function with the sample DataFrame as an argument\ndf_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will return a new DataFrame with two columns: `model` and `nrows`. The `model` column contains the names of the models, and the `nrows` column contains the number of rows for each model.\n\nYou can also use the `count` function from the DataFrames package to achieve the same result:\n```\nusing DataFrames\n\n# Create a sample DataFrame with columns 'model' and 'price'\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model = [\"Toyota\", \"Ford\", \"Chevrolet\", \"Honda\"], price = [22000, 25000, 27000, 32000])\n\n# Use the `count` function to group data by 'model' and calculate the number of rows for each group\ndf_counts = count(df_cars, :model)\n```\nThis will return a DataFrame with two columns: `model` and `nrows`.
