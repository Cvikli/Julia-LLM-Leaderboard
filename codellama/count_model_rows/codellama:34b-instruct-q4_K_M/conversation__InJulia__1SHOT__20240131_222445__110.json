The function uses the `length` function to get the number of rows in each group.\n\nTo use this function with your DataFrame `df_cars`, you can call it like this:\n```\ncount_model_rows(df_cars, :model)\n```\nThis will return a dictionary where the keys are the unique values in the `model` column and the values are the number of rows for each value.","status":200,"tokens":[0,178],"elapsed":4.958804031,"_type":"aimessage"}]
