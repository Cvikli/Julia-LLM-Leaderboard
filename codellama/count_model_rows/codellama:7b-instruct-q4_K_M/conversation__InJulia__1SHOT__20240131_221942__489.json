Here's an example code:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\n# Create a sample DataFrame with some cars data\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"Audi\", \"BMW\", \"Toyota\", \"Audi\", \"BMW\"],\n                     color=[\"red\", \"blue\", \"green\", \"yellow\", \"orange\"])\n\n# Group the data by model and count the number of rows for each group\ncount_model_rows(df) = map(group -> nrow(group), groupby(df, :model))\n\n# Print the result\nprintln(count_model_rows(df_cars)) # prints [2, 2, 1]\n```\nIn this example, we first create a sample DataFrame with some cars data. Then, we use the `groupby` method to group the data by model. The resulting groups are then passed to the `map` function, which applies the `nrow` function to each group and returns an array of the number of rows for each group. Finally, we print the result using `println`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,291],"elapsed":2.3826177,"_type":"aimessage"}]
