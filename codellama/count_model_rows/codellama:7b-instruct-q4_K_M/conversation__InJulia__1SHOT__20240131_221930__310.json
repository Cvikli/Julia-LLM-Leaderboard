The function first groups the data using the `groupby` function, then uses the `map` function to calculate the length of each group (i.e., the number of rows). Finally, it returns the vector of counts as a result.\n\nHere is an example usage of the function:\n```\njulia> df_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"A\"], price=[100, 200, 300, 400])\n4×2 DataFrame\n Row │ model   price\n     │ String  Int64\n─────┼──────────────\n   1 │ A       100\n   2 │ B       200\n   3 │ C       300\n   4 │ A       400\n\njulia> count_model_rows(df_cars)\n3-element Vector{Int64}:\n 2\n 1\n 1\n```\nIn this example, the function `count_model_rows` is applied to a `DataFrame` object named `df_cars`. The resulting vector contains the number of rows in each group created by grouping the data by the \"model\" column.","status":200,"tokens":[60,400],"elapsed":3.337541678,"_type":"aimessage"}]
