It groups the data by model using the `groupby` function and then calculates the number of rows for each group using the `|> nrow` operator. The resulting value is a dictionary where the keys are the unique models and the values are the number of rows for that model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,118],"elapsed":0.966374686,"_type":"aimessage"}]
