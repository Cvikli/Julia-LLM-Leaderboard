Define the `count_model_rows` function with a single argument `df_cars`, which is the DataFrame to analyze.\n 2. Inside the function, use the `groupby` method on the `model` column of the DataFrame to create groups based on the model type.\n 3. Count the number of rows in each group using the `count` method and assign it to a new variable called `row_count`.\n 4. Return the row count from inside the function.\n\nHere's how you can write this function:\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    model_groups = df_cars[:, :model] |> groupby\n    row_count = count.(model_groups)\n    return row_count\nend\n```\nIn this code, the `count` function is applied to each group in the `model_groups`, which effectively counts the number of rows in each group. The result of this operation is stored in the variable `row_count`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,230],"elapsed":9.396888699,"_type":"aimessage"}]
