This will allow us to group the data according to a specified column or columns. Then, we can count the number of rows in each group using the `.count` method. Here is an example solution:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames # Import DataFrames package for Julia \n# Function that groups data by model and counts how many rows there are for each model\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars) \n    groupby(df_cars, :model).count() # Use the .groupby method to group data by \"model\" column\nend\n```\nThe `count()` function will return a vector with the number of rows for each model.\n\nPlease note that this answer assumes that you have already imported the DataFrames package and created the initial DataFrame df_cars. If you haven't done this, please include them in your code before running the solution.","status":200,"tokens":[0,217],"elapsed":8.812117555,"_type":"aimessage"}]
