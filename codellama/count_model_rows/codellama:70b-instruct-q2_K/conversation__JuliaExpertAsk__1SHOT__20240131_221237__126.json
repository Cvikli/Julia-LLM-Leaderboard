It groups the DataFrame by the `model` column using the `by` function from the DataFrames package. For each group of data (that is, for each unique model), it calculates the number of rows in that group and returns these counts.\n\nLet me know if this is what you were looking for! ðŸ˜Š","status":200,"tokens":[0,330],"elapsed":13.41067006,"_type":"aimessage"}]
