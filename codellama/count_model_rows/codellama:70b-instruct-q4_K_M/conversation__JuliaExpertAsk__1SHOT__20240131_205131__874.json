I've also added some comments to explain what each line is doing.\n```julia-repl\n# Function definition with required argument \"df_cars\" (DataFrame)\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::AbstractDataFrame)\n    # Group the dataframe by model and calculate number of rows for each group using nrow() function \n    df_counts = combine(groupby(df_cars, :model), :nrow => sum)\n    \n    return df_counts\nend\n```\nThe `combine` function allows you to apply a function to each grouping of the data. The `groupby` function groups the dataframe by model. Then we use the `:nrow` argument to count the number of rows for each model. The `sum` argument indicates that it should be summed up.","status":200,"tokens":[0,214],"elapsed":11.3544078,"_type":"aimessage"}]
