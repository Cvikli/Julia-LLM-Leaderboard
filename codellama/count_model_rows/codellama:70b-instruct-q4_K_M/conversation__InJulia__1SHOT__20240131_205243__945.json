Load the necessary libraries `DataFrames` and `CSV`.\n2.  Read a CSV file named \"data.csv\" into a DataFrame called `df` using the `CSV` package's `File()` function.\n3.  Define a function `count_model_rows` that takes in a DataFrame as input (`df`).\n4.  Group the data by model and calculate number of rows for each group with the `by()` function. The result is stored in a new DataFrame called `result`.\n5.  Return the resulting DataFrame `result`, which contains two columns: `model` (the grouped value) and `x1` (the number of rows for each group).","status":200,"tokens":[0,244],"elapsed":12.933517339,"_type":"aimessage"}]
