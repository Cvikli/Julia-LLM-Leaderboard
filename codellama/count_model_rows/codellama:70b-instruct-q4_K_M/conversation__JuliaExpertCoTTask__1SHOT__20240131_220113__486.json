We then use the pipe operator `|>` to apply the groupby() function on the DataFrame using the model_column variable and combine(nrow) to calculate the number of rows for each model in the dataset.\nThe return statement returns the result, which is a table with the model and number of rows.","status":200,"tokens":[0,154],"elapsed":8.290145546,"_type":"aimessage"}]
