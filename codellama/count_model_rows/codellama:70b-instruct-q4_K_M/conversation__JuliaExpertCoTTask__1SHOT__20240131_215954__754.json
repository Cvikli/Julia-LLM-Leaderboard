The default grouping is `:model`. It then groups the data by `model`, counts the number of rows in each group using `combine` and `nrow`, and returns the result as a new DataFrame with two columns: `model` and `count`.\n\n\nHere's an example of how you would use this function to solve your task:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n# Create sample data.\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\n# Call the function to count the rows for each model.\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(counts)\n```\nExpected output:\n```julia\n3×2 DataFrame\n Row │ model   count\n     │ String  Int64\n─────┼───────────────\n   1 │ a4           3\n   2 │ q7           1\n   3 │ a6           1\n```\nNote that the output is in a different order because `groupby` sorts its output by default. You can use `sort!` to sort it by the count column if needed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,336],"elapsed":18.11838206,"_type":"aimessage"}]
