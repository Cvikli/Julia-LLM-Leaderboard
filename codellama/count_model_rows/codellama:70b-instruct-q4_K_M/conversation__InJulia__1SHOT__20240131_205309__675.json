Here's a simple function to group and count the number of rows per model in your DataFrame. You can use `groupby` and `combine`, which are from `DataFrames`:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    # Group by the \"model\" column\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    # Combine to calculate the number of rows per model\n    combined = combine(grouped, nrow => :count)\n    return combined\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df` as input, groups it by the \"model\" column using `groupby`, and then uses `combine` with `nrow` to calculate the number of rows per group. The result is stored in the `:count` column of the output. ğŸš—ğŸ’¨","status":200,"tokens":[0,225],"elapsed":11.921160778,"_type":"aimessage"}]
