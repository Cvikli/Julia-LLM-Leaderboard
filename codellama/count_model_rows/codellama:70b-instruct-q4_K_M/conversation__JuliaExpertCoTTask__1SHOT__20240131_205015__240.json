Define a function `count_model_rows` with an argument for the input DataFrame `df`.\n2. Use `groupby` on the model column and aggregate using `count()`. This will return the count of rows for each unique value in the model column.\n3. Assign the result to a variable called `result`, which represents the number of rows for each model in the dataset.\n4. Finally, return the `result`.\nHere is the Julia code that implements these steps:\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    # Group by the 'model' column and aggregate using 'count()' to get row counts for each model value\n    result = combine(groupby(df, :model), nrow => :count)\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\nThis function can be called as follows:\n```julia\nresult_df = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will group the data by model and calculate how many rows there are for each. The `result` DataFrame will contain a column with the unique model values and another column with the corresponding row counts for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,255],"elapsed":13.577688256,"_type":"aimessage"}]
