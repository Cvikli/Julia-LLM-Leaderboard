Make sure to replace this filename with your own or pass in a different filename as an argument to the function.\n* The `count_model_rows` function takes a DataFrame object (`df`) and returns the result of combining grouped rows, using `combine(groupby(...))`\n* `groupby(df, :model)` groups data by model values.\n* `nrow => :counts` counts how many rows there are for each model group (using the nrow function) and assigns those counts to a column named `:counts`.\n\nNow you can call this function on your cars DataFrame:\n```julia\ndf_cars = CSV.read(\"cars_data.csv\")\n# Calculate row counts for each model\nmodel_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\ndisplay(model_counts)\n```\n\nThe `display` function prints the result to standard output, showing you a table with two columns: model and counts.","status":200,"tokens":[0,404],"elapsed":21.492735522,"_type":"aimessage"}]
