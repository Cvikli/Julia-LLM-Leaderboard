Then, it defines a function `count_model_rows`, which groups data by model and calculates how many rows for each using NumPy's size method. The resultant count is stored in the variable `counts`. Finally, it prints out the resulting counts for each model and returns the data from the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,457],"elapsed":24.296078891,"_type":"aimessage"}]
