For example:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\nHere is some text with a `code block`.\n\n``` julia\nprintln(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\nAnd here's another line of text with no code block.\n\"\"\"\nresult = extract_julia_code(md)\nprintln(result)\n```\nThis would output:\n```julia\nprintln(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\nAs expected, the function correctly extracts and joins the Julia code block from the provided markdown document.\n\nTo test the function with different scenarios, you can create additional examples or use various markdown documents containing Julia code blocks.\n```\n\nIn this example, we define a function `extract_julia_code` that takes a markdown string as input and returns a single string representing all the extracted Julia code blocks. The function iterates through each line of the markdown document, checks if it is a Julia code block using the `startswith` and `endswith` functions, and joins the lines together with a newline character.\n\nTo use this function, you can pass a markdown string to it and print the result using `println(result)`. In the provided example, the function correctly extracts and joins the Julia code block from the given markdown document.\n\nAdditionally, you can create more examples or use various markdown documents containing Julia code blocks to test the function's functionality in different scenarios.\n\nThe provided solution demonstrates a simple and effective approach to extracting Julia code blocks from a markdown document using Julia programming language. The `extract_julia_code` function serves as a helpful tool for anyone who needs to process or analyze Julia code embedded in markdown documents.","status":200,"tokens":[110,636],"elapsed":21.063303708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
