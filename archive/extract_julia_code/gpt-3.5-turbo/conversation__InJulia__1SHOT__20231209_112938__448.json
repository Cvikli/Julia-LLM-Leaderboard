Here's the implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = split(md, \"```julia\")\n    code_blocks = code_blocks[2:end]\n    code_blocks = replace.(code_blocks, \"```\")\n    code_blocks = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    return code_blocks\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we use the `split` function to split the markdown document `md` into an array of code blocks, splitting at the \"```julia\" delimiter. We then remove the first empty element using `code_blocks[2:end]`.\n\nNext, we use the `replace.` function to remove the remaining \"```\" fences from each code block. Finally, we use the `join` function to join all the code blocks together with a newline separator.\n\nThe resulting string, which contains the extracted Julia code, is then returned by the function.","status":200,"tokens":[81,198],"elapsed":4.565641916,"_type":"aimessage"}]
