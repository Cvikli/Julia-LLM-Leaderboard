Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here's a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Tokenize the Markdown document\n    tokens = tokenize(md, RegEx=(r\"\\\\\\n?|\\\\r?|\\\\t\"), escape=false)\n\n    # Extract all code blocks\n    code_blocks = filter(tokens => iscodeblock(tokens))\n\n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `tokenize` function from the `Markdown` package to tokenize the Markdown document, and then filters out any tokens that are not code blocks using the `iscodeblock` function. Finally, it joins all the extracted code blocks together with a newline using the `join` function.\n\nNote: The `iscodeblock` function is defined as follows:\n```julia\nfunction iscodeblock(token::AbstractString)\n    # Check if the token is a code fence\n    return startswith(token, \"```\") && endswith(token, \"```\")\nend\n```\nThis function checks if the given token is a code fence by looking for the ````` syntax at the beginning and end of the token. If it finds a match, it returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[101,331],"elapsed":11.833030959,"_type":"aimessage"}]
