It then processes each section by removing any leading spaces and newlines. The extracted text is stored in a named tuple, which is added to the list of question/answer pairs.\n\nTo use this function, simply pass the markdown document as a string to the `q_and_a_extractor` function. The function will return a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a `QA` object (with the question and answer stripped of leading spaces and newlines) and the heading that the question/answer pair was found under (for reference).\n```\n\n#### 3 Sources\n\n1.
