Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer as a NamedTuple with keys `question` and `answer`. For a section to be valid, it must start at the beginning of the line. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text. Provide example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Great, let's get started! To extract the text in the markdown sections `Question` and `Answer`, we can use regular expressions to match the start and end of each section. Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Import the necessary modules:\n```julia\nusing TextTransform\nusing Markdown\n```\n2. Define a function to extract the text from the `Question` and `Answer` sections:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::Markdown)\n    # Extract the question text\n    question_text = markdown_section_text(md, \"# Question\")\n    # Extract the answer text\n    answer_text = markdown_section_text(md, \"# Answer\")\n    # Create a NamedTuple with keys 'question' and 'answer'\n    q_and_a = NamedTuple{(: question, : answer), Text}({question_text, answer_text})\n    return q_and_a\nend\n```\nHere, we use the `markdown_section_text` function from the `Markdown` module to extract the text from each section. We then create a NamedTuple with keys 'question' and 'answer', and pass the extracted text as the elements of the tuple.\n\n3. Provide examples:\n```julia\n# Example 1\nmd = Markdown(\"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is your favorite color?\n\n# Answer\nMy favorite color is blue.\n\"\"\")\nq_and_a = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(q_and_a) # Output: (:question=\"What is your favorite color?\", :answer=\"My favorite color is blue.\")\n\n# Example 2\nmd = Markdown(\"\"\"\n# Question\nHow old are you?\n\n# Answer (with multiple lines)\nI am 30 years old. I was born on February 14, 1992, and I live in New York City.\n\"\"\")\nq_and_a = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(q_and_a) # Output: (:question=\"How old are you?\", :answer=\"I am 30 years old. I was born on February 14, 1992, and I live in New York City.\")\n```\nIn the first example, we extract \"What is your favorite color?\" from the `Question` section, and \"My favorite color is blue.\" from the `Answer` section. In the second example, we extract \"How old are you?\" from the `Question` section, and \"I am 30 years old. I was born on February 14, 1992, and I live in New York City.\" from the `Answer` section, which spans multiple lines.\n\nThat's it! With these steps, you should be able to write a function that extracts the text from the `Question` and `Answer` sections of a markdown document, and returns a NamedTuple with the extracted text.","status":200,"tokens":[223,681],"elapsed":26.887536292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
