If a valid question and answer are found, they are returned as a NamedTuple with keys `question` and `answer`. In this case, the output is a single NamedTuple containing the extracted question and answer.\n```python\nq_and_a = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprint(f\"Question: {q_and_a[0].question}\\nAnswer: {q_and_a[0].answer}\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[123,412],"elapsed":13.760619333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
