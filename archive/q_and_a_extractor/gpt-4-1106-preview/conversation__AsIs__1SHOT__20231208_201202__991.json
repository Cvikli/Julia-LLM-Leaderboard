It assumes there is exactly one question and one answer in the provided markdown document. If more than one set of questions and answers or none at all are found, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\nRemember that `re.DOTALL` is used so that the dot (.) in the regular expressions matches any character including newlines, and `re.MULTILINE` is used so that `^` matches the start of each line, not just the start of the string.\n\nHere's what the output of the example usage would look like:\n\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: The capital of France is Paris.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[113,450],"elapsed":28.416951041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
