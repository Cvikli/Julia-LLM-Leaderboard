Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer as a NamedTuple with keys `question` and `answer`. For a section to be valid, it must start at the beginning of the line. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.
