[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown document `md` with many lines. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer as a NamedTuple with keys `question` and `answer`. For a section to be valid, it must start at the beginning of the line. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text. Provide example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Of course! Here is an example implementation of the `q_and_a_extractor` function in Julia:\n```\nmodule QAndAExtractor\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Initialize variables to store extracted text\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    # Loop through lines of the markdown document\n    for line in md\n        # Check if current line is a valid question or answer line\n        if linestartswith(\"# Question\")\n            # Extract question text and strip leading spaces and newlines\n            question = strip(line[8:end])\n        elseif linestartswith(\"# Answer\")\n            # Extract answer text and strip leading spaces and newlines\n            answer = strip(line[9:end])\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return named tuple with question and answer\n    QA = NamedTuple(\"Question\", question) \"Answer\", answer\nend\n\n# Example usage\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question: What is the capital of France?\n# Answer: The capital of France is Paris.\n\n# Question: How do you say hello in Spanish?\n# Answer: You can say \"hola\" in Spanish.\n\"\"\"\nq_and_a_extractor(md) # Output: QA = (\"Question\", \"What is the capital of France?\")(\"Answer\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\nIn this implementation, we first initialize two variables `question` and `answer` to store the extracted text. Then, we loop through each line of the markdown document using a `for` loop, and check if the current line is a valid question or answer line using the `linestartswith` function. If it is, we extract the text using string manipulation functions (e.g., `strip`) and store it in the corresponding variable. Finally, we return a named tuple with keys `question` and `answer`.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that each question and answer line starts at the beginning of a line, and that there are no leading spaces or newlines on the lines other than the `#` symbols. If your markdown document has different formatting, you may need to modify the implementation accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[127,480],"elapsed":17.106748333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
