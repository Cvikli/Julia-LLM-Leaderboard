The function first initializes an empty set `conflicting_events` to store any overlapping events.\n2. It then iterates through the list of events using a for loop, and for each event checks if it overlaps with any other event in the list using the `time_duration` class from the `dates` package. This is done by comparing the start and end times of the current event to the start and end times of every other event in the list using the `<=` and `>` operators.\n3. If there is an overlap, the function adds the overlapping event to the `conflicting_events` set.\n4. If there are no overlapping events, the function returns \"No conflicts\". Otherwise, it returns \"Conflict\".\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the list of events is not empty and that all event start and end times are in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`. If your input list contains any invalid or incomplete events, the function may return an incorrect result.","status":200,"tokens":[107,451],"elapsed":15.762239625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
