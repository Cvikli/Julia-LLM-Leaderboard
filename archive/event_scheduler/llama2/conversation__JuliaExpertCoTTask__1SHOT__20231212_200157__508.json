Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Check if there are any events that overlap in time.\n2. If there are no overlapping events, return \"No conflicts\".\n3. If there is at least one overlapping event, return \"Conflict\".\n\nHere's an example implementation of the `event_scheduler` function using the `Dates` package:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    overlapping_events = findall(x -> x.end > events[1].start, events)\n    if isempty(overlapping_events)\n        return \"No conflicts\"\n    else\n        return \"Conflict\"\n    end\nend\n\n# Test the function with some examples\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\")]) # No conflicts\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 12:00\")], [\"2023-12-01 11:00\"]) # Conflict at 11:00 - 12:00\n```\nIn this implementation, we first check if the list of events is empty. If it is, we return \"No events\". Otherwise, we use the `findall` function to find all events that overlap in time with each other. If there are no overlapping events, we return \"No conflicts\". Otherwise, we return \"Conflict\".\n\nI hope this helps!
