Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    # Sort the events based on the start time\n    sorted_events = sort(events, by = e -> Dates.DateTime(e[1], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"))\n    \n    # Check for conflicts\n    for i in 1:length(sorted_events)-1\n        if Dates.DateTime(sorted_events[i][2], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\") > Dates.DateTime(sorted_events[i+1][1], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list of events is empty. If it is, it returns \"No events\". Otherwise, it sorts the events based on the start time using the `sort` function and a custom sorting key. Then, it iterates through the sorted events and checks if the end time of the current event is greater than the start time of the next event. If it is, that means there is a scheduling conflict and the function returns \"Conflict\". If there are no conflicts after the loop, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[146,248],"elapsed":7.993705292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
