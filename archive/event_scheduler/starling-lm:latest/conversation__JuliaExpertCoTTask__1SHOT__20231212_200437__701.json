Based on the given requirements, I will approach this problem as follows:\n\nStep 1: Define a function to check for scheduling conflicts\n\nI will define a function `check_for_conflicts` that takes two tuples of start and end times as inputs. This function will return \"No conflicts\" if the times do not overlap, and \"Conflict\" otherwise.\n\nStep 2: Implement the `event_scheduler` function\n\nI will define a function `event_scheduler` that calls `check_for_conflicts` with each event in the list as inputs. If there are no overlapping events, the function will return \"No conflicts\". Otherwise, it will return \"Conflict\".\n\nHere is the implemented code:\n```julia\n# Step 1: Define a function to check for scheduling conflicts\nfunction check_for_conflicts(start1::DateTime, end1::DateTime, start2::DateTime, end2::DateTime)\n    if start1 <= end2 && start2 <= end1\n        return \"No conflicts\"\n    else\n        return \"Conflict\"\n    end\nend\n\n# Step 2: Implement the event_scheduler function\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{DateTime, DateTime}})\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    else\n        for (start, end) in events\n            result = check_for_conflicts(start, end)\n            if result != \"No conflicts\"\n                return result\n            end\n        end\n        return \"No conflicts\"\n    end\nend\n\n# Test the event_scheduler function\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\nIn this implementation, I use the `Dates` package to parse the start and end times as DateTime objects. The `check_for_conflicts` function checks for overlapping times by comparing the start time of each event to the end time of the previous event. If there are no overlapping times, the function returns \"No conflicts\". Otherwise, it returns \"Conflict\".\n\nThe `event_scheduler` function simply calls `check_for_conflicts` with each event in the list as inputs, and returns the result. If there are no overlapping events, the function returns \"No conflicts\". Otherwise, it returns the result of the `check_for_conflicts` function.\n\nI hope this helps!
