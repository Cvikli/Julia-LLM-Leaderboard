Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function that performs the described task using the `Dates` package for parsing:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Array{Tuple{String, String}, 1})::String\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    # Parse the events and sort them by their start times\n    parsed_events = [(DateTime(start, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"), DateTime(finish, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")) for (start, finish) in events]\n    sort!(parsed_events, by = x -> x[1])\n\n    # Check for conflicts\n    for i in 1:length(parsed_events)-1\n        if parsed_events[i][2] > parsed_events[i+1][1]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nYou can use this function by providing it with a list of event tuples.
