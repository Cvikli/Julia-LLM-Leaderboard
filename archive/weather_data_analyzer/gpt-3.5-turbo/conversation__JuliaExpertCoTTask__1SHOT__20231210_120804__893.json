Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return a `NamedTuple` (use `(; key=value...)` syntax) containing the average, maxi, min temperatures, and a trend (`:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a NamedTuple with all values as Nothing.

Check if the `temps` list is empty. If it is, return a NamedTuple with all values as Nothing.\n2. Calculate the average temperature using the `mean` function from the `Statistics` package.\n3. Find the maximum temperature using the `maximum` function.\n4. Find the minimum temperature using the `minimum` function.\n5. Check the trend of the temperatures by comparing the first and last elements of the list:\n   - If the first element is smaller than the last element, set the trend as `:increasing`.\n   - If the first element is larger than the last element, set the trend as `:decreasing`.\n   - Otherwise, set the trend as `:stable`.\n6.
