Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return a `NamedTuple` (use `(; key=value...)` syntax) containing the average, maxi, min temperatures, and a trend (`:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a NamedTuple with all values as Nothing.

Check if the list `temps` is empty. If empty, the function will return a NamedTuple with `Nothing` for all values.\n2. If the list is not empty, compute the average (mean), maximum (maxi), and minimum (min) temperature using the `Statistics` package.\n3. Determine the temperature trend. The trend is `:increasing` if each subsequent temperature is higher than the previous, `:decreasing` if each subsequent temperature is lower than the previous, and `:stable` otherwise.\n4.
