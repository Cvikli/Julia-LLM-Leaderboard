Here's my approach to solving this problem:\n\n1. I will use a loop to iterate over the words in the input string.\n2. I will check the length of each word and calculate the total length of all words so far.\n3. If the total length exceeds the maximum allowed width, I will add a new line and start the next word on a new line.\n4. I will repeat steps 1-3 until the end of the input string is reached.\n\nHere's the implementation in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    total_length = 0\n    for word in split(text, \" \")\n        length = length(word)\n        if total_length + length > text_width\n            print(\"-----------------\")\n            total_length = 0\n        end\n        total_length += length\n        print(word)\n    end\nend\n```\nLet's test the function with some examples. Please provide the input string for which you would like me to wrap the words.","status":200,"tokens":[140,248],"elapsed":9.857804625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
