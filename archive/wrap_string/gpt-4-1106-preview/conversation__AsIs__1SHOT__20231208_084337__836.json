It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceed. Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple `wrap_string` function in Python that takes a string and wraps it line by line without breaking words. If a word itself exceeds the `text_width`, it will be put on a new line regardless. This function also takes into consideration punctuation and white spaces:\n\n```python\ndef wrap_string(text, text_width=10):\n    words = text.split()\n    current_line = \"\"\n    wrapped_text = \"\"\n\n    for word in words:\n        # Include space in length calculation if current_line is not empty\n        space_length = 1 if current_line else 0\n        # Check if adding the new word exceeds the line length\n        if len(current_line) + len(word) + space_length > text_width:\n            # Add current line to wrapped_text and reset current_line\n            if current_line:  # avoid adding empty lines\n                wrapped_text += current_line + \"\\n\"\n            current_line = word  # start a new line with the current word\n        else:\n            # Add word to current line with space if line not empty\n            current_line += (\" \" if current_line else \"\") + word\n\n    # Add any remaining text in current_line to wrapped_text\n    if current_line:\n        wrapped_text += current_line\n\n    return wrapped_text\n\n# Example usage:\nexample_text = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"\nwrapped = wrap_string(example_text)\nprint(wrapped)\n```\n\nExample output:\n\n```\nThe quick\nbrown fox\njumps over\nthe lazy\ndog.\n```\n\nIn this example, the input text is `\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"` and the `text_width` is set to the default value of 10. The function splits the text into words and then reconstructs the text, line by line, ensuring that adding another word to the line does not exceed the `text_width`. When the `text_width` would be exceeded, a newline character is appended to the text and the current word becomes the beginning of a new line. Note that this function preserves the order of the words and does not insert hyphens or otherwise break words across lines.\n\nIf you want to use this function in a different programming language or have any other specific requirements, please provide more information so I can modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[55,468],"elapsed":38.287686292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
