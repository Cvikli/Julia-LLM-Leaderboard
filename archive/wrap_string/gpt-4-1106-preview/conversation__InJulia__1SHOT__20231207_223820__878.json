In Julia, we can create a function `wrap_string` that takes an input string and wraps the text so that each line is at most `text_width` characters long. Below is an implementation that does this, and ensures that words themselves are not split across lines unless a single word is longer than the `text_width` limit.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    current_line_length = 0\n    wrapped_text = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        word_length = length(word)\n        \n        # If the current word would exceed the text_width or it is exactly the remaining length\n        if current_line_length + word_length > text_width\n            # Start a new line unless we're already at the beginning of a line\n            if current_line_length > 0\n                wrapped_text *= \"\\n\"\n            end\n            # Reset current line length\n            current_line_length = 0\n        end\n        \n        # If we're not at the start of the line, append a space before word\n        if current_line_length > 0\n            wrapped_text *= \" \"\n            current_line_length += 1  # Account for the space\n        end\n        \n        # Append the word and update the line length\n        wrapped_text *= word\n        current_line_length += word_length\n        \n        # Break if word is longer than text_width, but allow it on its own line\n        if word_length > text_width\n            wrapped_text *= \"\\n\"\n            current_line_length = 0\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return wrapped_text\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ntext = \"Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nIf you run this code, it will print out the input string with newlines inserted at appropriate positions so that each line is at most `text_width` characters long, without splitting words. The exception is when a single word exceeds the `text_width`, in which case it will be placed on a new line by itself.\n\nExample output (with `text_width=10` for illustration, real output might differ as spaces and word lengths will affect the result):\n```\nJulia is a\nhigh-level,\nhigh-\nperformance\ndynamic\nprogramming\nlanguage\nfor\ntechnical\ncomputing.\n```\n\nNote that if `text_width` is set to a small number (like 10 in the example), some words might be unavoidably longer than the limit because they will not be split.","status":200,"tokens":[58,533],"elapsed":36.518005167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
