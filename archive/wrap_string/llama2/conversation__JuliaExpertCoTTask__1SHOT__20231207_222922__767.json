Based on the task provided, I understand that we need to write a function called `wrap_string` that iterates over words in a string and adds a new line each time the maximum width of the string is exceeded.\n\nHere's my approach:\n\n1. Define the `wrap_string` function that takes a string as input.\n2. Iterate over each word in the string using a loop (e.g., `forword`).\n3. Check the current word's width to see if it exceeds the maximum allowed width.\n4. If the current word exceeds the maximum width, add a new line and start a new word.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the end of the string is reached.\n\nHere's an example implementation:\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the wrapped words\n    wrapped_words = []\n\n    # Iterate over each word in the input string\n    for word in split(text)\n        # Check if the current word exceeds the maximum width\n        if length(word) > text_width\n            # Add a new line and start a new word\n            wrapped_words += [\"\"]\n            continue\n        end\n        # Append the current word to the list\n        wrapped_words += [word]\n    end\n\n    # Return the wrapped words\n    return wrapped_words\nend\n\n# Example usage\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")\n```\nIn this example, the input string is `\"This function will wrap words into lines\"`, and the maximum width is set to 10. The `wrap_string` function iterates over each word in the string, checks if it exceeds the maximum width, and adds a new line and starts a new word if necessary. The resulting wrapped words are returned as a list.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.","status":200,"tokens":[148,447],"elapsed":21.712017958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
