The resulting string is then converted to a `Symbol` for consistency.\n\nTo use this function, simply call it with your desired column name as an argument:\n\n```julia\nmy_column = \"My Column\"\nclean_column(my_column)  # This will output Symbol(\"my_column\")\n```\n\nRemember that the `Symbol` type in Julia is similar to Python's `str`, but it doesn't support indexing or slicing. It is mainly used for its compactness and efficiency in hash tables.","status":200,"tokens":[0,214],"elapsed":5.668648316,"_type":"aimessage"}]
