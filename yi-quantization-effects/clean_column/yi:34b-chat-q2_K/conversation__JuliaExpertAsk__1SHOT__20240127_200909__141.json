It first lowercases the input string using `lowerci(str)`, then strips any leading or trailing whitespace using `strip(str; [whitespace])` (which includes space, tab, and newline characters), and finally replaces any spaces (`' '`) with an underscore (`'_'`). If your Julia version is older than 1.2, you should use `replace(str, ' ' => '_')` instead of the chained `strip` and `replace` as shown above.","status":200,"tokens":[0,175],"elapsed":4.481996405,"_type":"aimessage"}]
