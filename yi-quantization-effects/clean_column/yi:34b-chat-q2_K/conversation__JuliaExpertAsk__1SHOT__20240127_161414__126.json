It lowercases the column name using `lowercase()`.\n2. It strips leading and trailing whitespaces using `strip(::AbstractString)`, which is equivalent to calling `String(strip(::SubString{String}, Whitespace()))` in Julia v1.6+.\n3. It appends an underscore (`\"_\"`) at the end.\n\nPlease note that this function does not handle non-ASCII characters or symbols other than hyphens and spaces. If you need to support more complex column names, you may need to extend the functionality of this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,200],"elapsed":5.124594598,"_type":"aimessage"}]
