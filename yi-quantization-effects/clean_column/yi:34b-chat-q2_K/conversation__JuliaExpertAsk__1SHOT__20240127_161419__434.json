It does this by:\n\n1. Lowercasing the input string using `lowercase()`.\n2. Removing any whitespace characters with `replace(col, r\"\\s+\" => \"_\")`. The regular expression `r\"\\s+\"` matches one or more whitespace characters, and `replace` replaces all occurrences of these with underscores.\n3. Finally, it joins the lowercased string with the underscore-replaced string using `string(...)` to ensure that the output is a properly formatted String.","status":200,"tokens":[0,193],"elapsed":4.950848908,"_type":"aimessage"}]
