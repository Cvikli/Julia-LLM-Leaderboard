The string is lowercased using the `lowercase()` function.\n2. Any leading or trailing whitespaces are stripped by calling `replace(col, \"\")` which replaces any occurrences of an empty string (which matches any leading or trailing whitespace) with nothing, effectively removing it.\n3. Spaces and hyphens are replaced with underscores using the regular expression `r\"\\s+\"` which matches one or more whitespace characters, and `replace(col, r\"\\s+\" => \"_\")` replaces these matches with an underscore.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\njulia> clean_column(\"My Column\")\n\"my_column\"\n```\n\nThe regular expression `r\"\\s+\"` is used to match one or more whitespace characters, including spaces and tabs. The `replace()` function with a regular expression as the first argument will replace all matches of that regular expression with the second argument provided. In this case, it's replaced with an underscore (`\"_\"`).","status":200,"tokens":[0,313],"elapsed":9.037357157,"_type":"aimessage"}]
