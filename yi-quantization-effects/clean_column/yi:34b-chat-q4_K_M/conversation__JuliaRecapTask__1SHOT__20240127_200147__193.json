[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    return lowercase(replace(col, r\"^\\s+|\\s+$|[- ]+\" => \"_\"))\nend\n\n# Example usage:\njulia> col = \"My Column\"\n\"My Column\"\n\njulia> clean_column(col)\n\"my_column\"\n```\n\nIn this function, we use `lowercase` to convert the column name to lowercase. We then use `replace` with a regular expression to match and replace any leading or trailing whitespace with an underscore (`_`), as well as replacing sequences of one or more spaces or hyphens with an underscore. The regular expression `r\"^\\s+|\\s+$|[- ]+\"` matches:\n\n- Any sequence of one or more whitespaces at the start of the string (`\\s+`).\n- Any sequence of one or more whitespaces at the end of the string (`\\s+$`).\n- Any sequences of one or more spaces or hyphens within the string (`[- ]+`).\n\nThis ensures that both leading and trailing whitespace, as well as internal spaces and hyphens, are replaced with an underscore. The function is written to be general for any `AbstractString` input.","status":200,"tokens":[0,282],"elapsed":8.104931777,"_type":"aimessage"}]
