The second argument in `replace` is a tuple where the first element is the old substring and the second element is the new substring that will replace it. In this case, we're replacing both spaces and hyphens with underscores.","status":200,"tokens":[0,135],"elapsed":3.809826564,"_type":"aimessage"}]
