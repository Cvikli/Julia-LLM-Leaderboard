It first lowercases the column name and removes any non-word characters using `replace` with a regular expression. Then it strips leading and trailing whitespace. Finally, it replaces spaces and hyphens with underscores using another `replace` call with a different regex pattern.","status":200,"tokens":[0,136],"elapsed":3.833791613,"_type":"aimessage"}]
