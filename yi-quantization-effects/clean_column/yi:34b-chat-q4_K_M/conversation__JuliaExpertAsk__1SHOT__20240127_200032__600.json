Calls `strip` to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the column name.\n2. Calls `lowercase` to convert the entire string to lowercase.\n3. Calls `replace` with a substitution expression to replace hyphens (`-`) with underscores (`_`).\n4. Returns the processed column name.\n\nPlease note that this function does not handle more complex cases like camelCase or snake_case conversion, as it is designed to specifically clean up column names for database compatibility (where lowercase and underscore are commonly used).","status":200,"tokens":[105,169],"elapsed":4.939588185,"_type":"aimessage"}]
