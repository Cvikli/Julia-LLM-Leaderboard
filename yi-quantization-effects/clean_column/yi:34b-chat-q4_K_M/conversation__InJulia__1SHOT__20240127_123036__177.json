It first calls the `lowercase()` function to convert the column name to lowercase. Then it strips any leading or trailing whitespaces using `strip()`. Finally, it appends an underscore (`\"_\"`) at the end of the string.\n\nTo use this function, you can simply call it with a column name:\n\n```julia\njulia> clean_column(\"My Column\")\n\"my_column\"\n```\n\nThe `* \"_\"` is used to concatenate the string with an underscore, which is why the underscore appears at the end of the returned string. This is a shorthand syntax for `string($result, \"_\")` where `$result` would hold the value of the expression `lowercase(strip(col))` after it has been evaluated.","status":200,"tokens":[75,257],"elapsed":7.418567775,"_type":"aimessage"}]
