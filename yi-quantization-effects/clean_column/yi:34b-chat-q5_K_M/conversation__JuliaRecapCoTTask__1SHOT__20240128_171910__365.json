[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Recall Julia Snippets\n\nHere are some relevant Julia snippets that might be useful for the task:\n\n```julia\n# Lowercase a string\nstring_lower = lowercase(\"Hello World\") # Output: \"hello world\"\n\n# Strip leading and trailing whitespaces\nstripped_string = strip(\" Hello World \") # Output: \"Hello World\"\n\n# Replace characters in a string with another character\nreplaced_string = replace(\"my column-1\", '-' => '_') # Output: \"my column_1\"\n```\n\n# Solve the Task\n\nUsing the above snippets as a reference, we can define our `clean_column` function as follows:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    return replace(strip(lowercase(col)), '-' => '_')\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes an `AbstractString` representing a column name and returns the cleaned version of the string. It first lowers the case of the input string using `lowercase()`, then strips any leading and trailing whitespaces with `strip()`, and finally replaces hyphens with underscores using `replace(col, '-' => '_')`.\n\n# Double-check that the Solution is Correct\n\nTo ensure our function works as expected, we can write a few test cases:\n\n```julia\n# Test cases\nnames = [\"My Column\", \"my-column 1\", \"   my column    \"]\nexpected_results = [\"my_column\", \"my_column_1\", \"my_column\"]\n\nfor (name, expected) in zip(names, expected_results)\n    result = clean_column(name)\n    @assert result == expected  # Assert that the result matches the expected value\nend\n```\n\nThis test code iterates over a list of names and their corresponding expected cleaned versions. For each pair, it calls `clean_column` and uses an assertion to check if the result matches the expected output. If all assertions pass, we can be confident that our function is working as intended.","status":200,"tokens":[0,465],"elapsed":15.39860102,"_type":"aimessage"}]
