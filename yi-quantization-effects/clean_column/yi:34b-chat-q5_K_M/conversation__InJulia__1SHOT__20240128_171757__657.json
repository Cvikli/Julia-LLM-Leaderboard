The function will take the original column name as input and return the cleaned version. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)\n    return lowercase(strip(col)) * \"_\" * replace(col, '-' => '_')\nend\n\n# Example usage:\noriginal_column = \"My Column\"\ncleaned_column = clean_column(original_column)\nprintln(cleaned_column)  # Output will be: \"my_column\"\n```\n\nIn this example, the `clean_column` function uses `lowercase()` to make the column name lowercase, `strip()` to strip leading and trailing whitespaces, and then it replaces any hyphens with underscores using `replace()`. Finally, it concatenates an underscore to the end of the cleaned string to ensure that the resulting column name has an underscore at the end if there was a space or hyphen in the original name.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the input column name does not already contain an underscore at the end. If your data contains column names with underscores at the end, you might need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,278],"elapsed":9.040412932,"_type":"aimessage"}]
