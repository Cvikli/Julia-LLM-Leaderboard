[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    # Lowercase the column name\n    col = lowercase(col)\n    \n    # Strip leading and trailing whitespaces\n    col = strip(col)\n    \n    # Replace spaces and hyphens with underscore\n    col = replace(col, r\"\\s|-\" => \"_\")\n    \n    return col\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a string `col` representing a column name and returns a cleaned version of the column name by following these steps:\n\n1. Lowercases the column name using Julia's built-in `lowercase()` function.\n2. Strips any leading and trailing whitespaces using `strip(str)` which removes all occurrences of whitespace from the start and end of the string `str`.\n3. Replaces spaces and hyphens with an underscore using `replace(str, pat => repl)` where `pat` is a regular expression pattern to match, and `repl` is the replacement string.\n\nPlease note that in Julia, strings are case-sensitive by default, so \"My Column\" and \"my column\" are considered different. The function above ensures that regardless of the case or presence of whitespaces and hyphens, the returned column name will be in a consistent format without any leading or trailing whitespace and with underscores instead of spaces or hyphens.","status":200,"tokens":[386,301],"elapsed":11.560438962,"_type":"aimessage"}]
