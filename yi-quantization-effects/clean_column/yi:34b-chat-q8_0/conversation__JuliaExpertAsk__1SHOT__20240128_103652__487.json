Calls `strip` to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the column name (`col`).\n2. Then, it calls `lowercase` to convert the entire string to lowercase.\n3. Finally, it uses `replace` with a substitution rule to replace both spaces and hyphens with an underscore.\n\nPlease note that this function does not handle edge cases like multiple whitespace characters or non-alphanumeric characters other than hyphens. If you need to support more complex column names, you may want to extend the regex or add additional checks.","status":200,"tokens":[0,171],"elapsed":7.664655002,"_type":"aimessage"}]
