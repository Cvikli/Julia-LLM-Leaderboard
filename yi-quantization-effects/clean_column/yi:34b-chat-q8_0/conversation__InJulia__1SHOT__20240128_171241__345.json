Calls `lowercase()` to make the column name lowercase.\n2. Calls `strip()` to remove leading and trailing whitespace from the column name.\n3. Uses the `|>` pipe operator to chain operations on the string.\n4. Applies `replace(' ' => '_')` to replace spaces with underscores.\n5. Applies `replace('-' => '_')` to replace hyphens with underscores.\n\nThe `strip()` function in Julia is a bit different from similar functions in other languages because it only strips whitespace at the beginning and end of the string; it does not touch any whitespace that occurs inside the string. This behavior is consistent with other functions in Base Julia that work on characters, like `split` or `findall`.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\njulia> clean_column(\"My Column\")\n\"my_column\"\n```\n\nThe pipe operator (`|>`) is used for pipelining (chaining operations) in Julia. It passes the output of one operation to the next function as its first argument. This makes the code more readable and allows you to write functions that work on a single argument without having to explicitly pass an argument or use `return` statements.","status":200,"tokens":[75,363],"elapsed":16.455035209,"_type":"aimessage"}]
