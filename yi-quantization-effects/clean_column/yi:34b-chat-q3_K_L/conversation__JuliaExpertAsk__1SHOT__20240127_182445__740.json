The column name is converted to lowercase using `lowercase()`.\n2. Leading and trailing whitespaces are stripped using `strip(col)`.\n3. Spaces and hyphens are replaced with underscores using `replace(\"-\", \"_\")` and `replace(\" \", \"_\")` in that order.\n\nThe function uses piped operators to chain these modifications together efficiently.","status":200,"tokens":[0,164],"elapsed":4.501459185,"_type":"aimessage"}]
