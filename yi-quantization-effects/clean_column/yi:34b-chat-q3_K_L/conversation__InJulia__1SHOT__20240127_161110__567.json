Lowercases the column name using `lowercase()`.\n2. Strips leading and trailing whitespace with `strip(col)`.\n3. Replaces any spaces and hyphens with an underscore using `replace(col, '-' => '_')`.\n4. Finally, it concatenates the original lowercased name with an underscore to ensure that all names are converted to the desired format.\n\nPlease note that in Julia, function parameters are passed by copy by default, so any changes made within the function to the parameter `col` will not reflect outside the function. To modify the original string in-place, you would need to pass it by reference using a mutable argument or create an in-place version of the `replace` function (which does not exist in Base Julia).\n\nIf you want to keep the original name as is if it's already lowercase and doesn't contain any spaces or hyphens, you can modify the function like this:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    if !occursin(' ', col) && !occursin('-', col) && islowercase(col)\n        return col\n    end\n    return lowercase(strip(col)) * \"_\" * replace(col, '-' => '_')\nend\n```\n\nThis version checks if the column name doesn't contain any spaces or hyphens and is already lowercase. If so, it returns the original name; otherwise, it applies the cleaning process as before.","status":200,"tokens":[0,445],"elapsed":12.253641536,"_type":"aimessage"}]
