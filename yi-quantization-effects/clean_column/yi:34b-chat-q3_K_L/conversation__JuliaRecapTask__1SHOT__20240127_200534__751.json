[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    return lowercase(strip(col)) * '_' * strip(replace(col, [\" \", \"-\"] => \"_\"))\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a string `col` as input and returns a new string with the following transformations applied:\n\n1. Lowercasing using `lowercase()`.\n2. Stripping leading and trailing whitespaces using `strip(col)`.\n3. Replacing spaces and hyphens with underscores using `replace(col, [\" \", \"-\"] => \"_\")`.\n4. Concatenating an underscore at the end of the string to ensure consistency in the format.\n\nThe function is named `clean_column`, which is descriptive of its purpose. It takes a single parameter `col` which is an abstract type for strings (`AbstractString`). This allows it to work with any kind of string without being too restrictive.","status":200,"tokens":[386,215],"elapsed":6.251885211,"_type":"aimessage"}]
