Lowercase the entire string using `lowercase()`.\n2. Strip leading and trailing whitespaces using `strip()`.\n3. Replace any spaces (`' '`) and hyphens (`'-'`) with underscores (`'_'`) using `replace()`.\n\nThe pipe operator `|>` is used to chain the functions together, applying them in sequence to the string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,147],"elapsed":11.400833489,"_type":"aimessage"}]
