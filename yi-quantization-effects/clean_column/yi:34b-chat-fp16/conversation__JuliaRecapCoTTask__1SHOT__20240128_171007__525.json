[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    return lowercase(strip(col)) |> replace => '-' => '_'\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `replace` function from Base Julia to replace all hyphens with underscores. The pipe operator (`|>`) is used to chain the operations together. First, `col` is stripped of leading and trailing whitespaces using `strip`, then it is lowercased using `lowercase`, and finally, any hyphens are replaced with underscores using `replace`.\n\nPlease note that the version of Julia where this answer was created was 1.7.0. The pipe operator (`|>`) might not be available in older versions. If you're using an older version, you can use the following instead:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    return lowercase(strip(col))\nend\n\nclean_column(col) = replace(lowercase(strip(col)), '-' => '_')\n```\n\nIn this older version-compatible example, the function is defined without using the pipe operator, and the `replace` call with the substitution rule is assigned to a local variable.","status":200,"tokens":[11,265],"elapsed":20.664934285,"_type":"aimessage"}]
