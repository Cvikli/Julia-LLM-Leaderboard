It first lowercases the string, then strips any leading or trailing whitespace using `strip()`, which is a built-in function in Julia that removes both leading and trailing whitespace from a string. Finally, it replaces spaces and hyphens with an underscore using `replace()`, which is also a built-in function in Julia that replaces all occurrences of a pattern with another string.\n\nTo use this function, you can simply call it with the column name you want to clean:\n\n```julia\njulia> clean_column(\"My Column\")\n\"my_column\"\n```\n\nThis will return \"my_column\" as the cleaned version of the input string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,281],"elapsed":21.766567986,"_type":"aimessage"}]
