The string is lowercased using `lowercase()`.\n2. Leading and trailing whitespaces are stripped using `strip(col)`.\n3. Spaces and hyphens within the string are replaced with underscores using `replace(' ', '_')` and `replace('-', '_')`, respectively.\n\nThe pipe operator (`|>`) is used to chain these operations together, ensuring that each operation is performed on the output of the previous one.","status":200,"tokens":[105,167],"elapsed":5.45165969,"_type":"aimessage"}]
