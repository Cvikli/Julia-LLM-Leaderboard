It uses `strip` to remove leading and trailing whitespaces, `lowercase` to make the string lowercase, and then replaces spaces and hyphens with an underscore using `String` conversion and symbol creation. The `'\\n'` and `'\\t'` are specifically mentioned to strip newline and tab characters, which can also be considered whitespace in some contexts.","status":200,"tokens":[0,159],"elapsed":5.035796026,"_type":"aimessage"}]
