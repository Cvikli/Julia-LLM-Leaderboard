Calls `lowercase` to convert the string to lowercase.\n2. Calls `strip` to remove any leading or trailing whitespace.\n3. Uses `replace` with a lambda function to replace spaces with underscores.\n4. Finally, it replaces hyphens with underscores using another call to `replace`.\n\nThe result is a clean version of the column name where all whitespaces are replaced with underscores and the name is in lowercase without any leading or trailing whitespace.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\njulia> clean_column(\"My Column\")\n\"my_column\"\n```\n\nRemember that you should always try to match the case of column names when working with data frames in Julia, as some libraries (like DataFrames.jl) preserve the original case during operations like filtering and grouping. However, this function can be useful for cleaning up string representations of column names before further processing or for situations where the original casing is not important.","status":200,"tokens":[0,311],"elapsed":9.862065034,"_type":"aimessage"}]
