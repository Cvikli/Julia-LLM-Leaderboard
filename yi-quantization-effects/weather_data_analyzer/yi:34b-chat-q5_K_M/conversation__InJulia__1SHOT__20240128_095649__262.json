Calculates the average temperature using `mean()`.\n2. Finds the maximum temperature using `maximum()`.\n3. Finds the minimum temperature using `minimum()`.\n4. Determines the trend based on a simple moving average with a window size of 5. If the mean of the first five values and the mean of the last five values are within 0.25 units of the current average, the trend is considered stable. Otherwise, if both the means are greater than the current average, the trend is increasing; otherwise, it's decreasing.\n\nThe function returns a named tuple with `average`, `max`, `min`, and `trend` fields, where each field contains the corresponding result or `nothing` if the list is empty.","status":200,"tokens":[0,439],"elapsed":14.360479325,"_type":"aimessage"}]
