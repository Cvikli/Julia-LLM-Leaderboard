It also determines the trend based on the standard deviation (`std`) of the temperatures. If the standard deviation is small (in this case, we use an arbitrary threshold of 1), the trend is considered stable; otherwise, it's classified as either increasing or decreasing based on whether the maximum temperature is greater than or less than the minimum temperature.\n\nThe function returns a named tuple with the calculated values for average, maximum, and minimum temperatures, along with the determined trend. If the list of temperatures is empty, the function returns a named tuple with all fields set to `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,470],"elapsed":15.42593796,"_type":"aimessage"}]
