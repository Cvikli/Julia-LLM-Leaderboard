Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package).

If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can create a function that performs statistical analyses on a list of daily temperature data using the `Statistics` package as follows:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Calculate the trend using the method of your choice (e.g., linear regression)\n    # For simplicity, we'll use a simple increasing/decreasing check\n    previous_value = temps[1]\n    trend = :stable\n    for value in temps\n        if value > previous_value\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif value < previous_value\n            trend = :decreasing\n            break # If it decreases once, it's not increasing overall\n        end\n        previous_value = value\n    end\n\n    return (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ntemps = [10, 20, 30, 40] # Sample temperature data\nresult = weather_data_analyzer(temps)\nprintln(\"Average temperature: \", result.average)\nprintln(\"Maximum temperature: \", result.max)\nprintln(\"Minimum temperature: \", result.min)\nprintln(\"Temperature trend: \", result.trend)\n```\n\nPlease note that the `trend` determination in this example is very basic and does not use a sophisticated statistical method like linear regression. It simply checks if all temperatures are increasing or decreasing compared to the first value. In practice, you might want to use a more robust method for trend analysis.","status":200,"tokens":[0,419],"elapsed":13.695940354,"_type":"aimessage"}]
