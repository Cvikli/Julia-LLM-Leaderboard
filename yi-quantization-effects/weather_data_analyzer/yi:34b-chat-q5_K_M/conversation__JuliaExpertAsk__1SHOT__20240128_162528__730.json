The trend is determined using the first-order difference method, which compares consecutive temperature differences to determine if they are consistently increasing or decreasing. If the list is empty, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[186,344],"elapsed":11.426448573,"_type":"aimessage"}]
