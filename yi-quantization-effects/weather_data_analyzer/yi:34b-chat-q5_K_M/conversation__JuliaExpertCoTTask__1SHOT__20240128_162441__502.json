Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    mean_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Check for temperature trend using linear regression on the log-transformed data\n    x = collect(1:length(temps))  # Convert temperatures to index as x values\n    y = log.(temps)               # Log-transform temperatures\n    coef, _, _ = fit(LinearModel, x => y)\n    slope = coef[1]              # Get the slope of the regression line\n\n    if slope > 0\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif slope < 0\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (average = mean_temp, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = trend)\nend\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])  # Example usage\n```\n\nThis function follows the given steps:\n\n1.

Finds the maximum and minimum temperatures using `maximum()` and `minimum()`, respectively.\n4. Performs linear regression on the log-transformed data to determine the trend (increasing, decreasing, or stable). The log transformation is used to account for any multiplicative effect that may be present in the data. If the slope of the regression line is positive, the trend is considered increasing; if negative, it's decreasing; otherwise, it's stable.\n5. Returns a named tuple with the computed values and the determined trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,447],"elapsed":14.721037079,"_type":"aimessage"}]
