Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Calculate the trend using the mean of each pair of consecutive values\n    # and check if it's increasing, decreasing, or stable\n    trend = if abs(avg_temp - (mean(temps[2:end]) + temps[1])) > 0.5 # Threshold can be adjusted\n        if avg_temp < mean(temps[2:end])\n            :increasing\n        elseif avg_temp > mean(temps[2:end])\n            :decreasing\n        else\n            :stable\n        end\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n\n    return (average = avg_temp, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Statistics` package to calculate the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures. It then calculates a simple trend by comparing the mean of all values with the mean of the second half of the values (excluding the first value). If the difference exceeds a certain threshold (0.5 in this case), it's considered a significant change, and the trend is determined accordingly. Otherwise, the trend is considered stable. The threshold can be adjusted based on the requirements of the specific application.","status":200,"tokens":[0,355],"elapsed":11.606228936,"_type":"aimessage"}]
