Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{Float64})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    # Calculate average, maximum, and minimum temperatures\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Determine temperature trend (increasing, decreasing, or stable)\n    n = length(temps)\n    diffs = temps[2:end] .- temps[1:(end - 1)]  # Calculate differences between consecutive temperatures\n    if sum(diffs) > 0\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif sum(diffs) < 0\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])  # Output will be shown when you run this code in a Julia session\n```\n\nPlease note that the `trend` determination is based on the sum of differences between consecutive temperatures. If the sum is positive, the trend is increasing; if it's negative, the trend is decreasing; otherwise, it's considered stable. This method assumes that there are no extreme changes in temperature outside the given data range.","status":200,"tokens":[290,345],"elapsed":17.294888242,"_type":"aimessage"}]
