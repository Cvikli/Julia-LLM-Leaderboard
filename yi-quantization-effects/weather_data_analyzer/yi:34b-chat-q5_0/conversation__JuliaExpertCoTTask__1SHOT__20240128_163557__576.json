Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{T}) where T <: Real\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max = maximum(temps)\n    min = minimum(temps)\n    diff_to_prev = diff(temps)\n    is_increasing = all(x -> x > 0, diff_to_prev[2:end])\n    is_decreasing = all(x -> x < 0, diff_to_prev[2:end])\n    trend = is_increasing ? :increasing : (is_decreasing ? :decreasing : :stable)\n\n    return (; average=average, max=max, min=min, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\n# Checking the Solution\n\nTo check that the solution works as expected, we can run it on a sample temperature list:\n\n```julia\ntemps = [25, 27, 23, 20, 22]\nweather_data_analyzer(temps)\n```\n\nThis should return a named tuple with the average, maximum, minimum temperatures, and the trend.
