[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers).

If it is, it returns a named tuple with all fields set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average temperature using `mean` from the `Statistics` package, finds the maximum and minimum temperatures using `maximum` and `minimum` respectively, and then determines the trend based on whether the average temperature is equal to the maximum or minimum, or if all temperatures are greater than or less than the average. If none of these conditions are met, the trend is set to `nothing`. Finally, it returns a named tuple with the calculated values for average, maximum, minimum, and trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,345],"elapsed":11.150324686,"_type":"aimessage"}]
