Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max = maximum(temps)\n    min = minimum(temps)\n    # Checking for a trend is not straightforward with only 5 data points.\n    # For simplicity, we'll assume that if the average of the first half and second half are equal,\n    # it's stable, otherwise increasing or decreasing based on the direction of change.\n    half1 = temps[1:2]\n    half2 = temps[3:end]\n    if average(half1) â‰ˆ average(half2)\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif (average(half1) < average(half2))\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n\n    return (; average=average, max=max, min=min, trend=trend)\nend\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])  # Output will be shown when you run this line in a Julia REPL.\n```\n\nPlease note that the `trend` determination is a simplified approach and may not accurately represent actual trends over longer periods of time or with more complex data.
