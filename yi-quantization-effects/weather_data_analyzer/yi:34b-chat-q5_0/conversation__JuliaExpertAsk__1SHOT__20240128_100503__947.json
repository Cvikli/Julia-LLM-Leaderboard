The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`).

It also checks if the temperature is increasing or decreasing by comparing the average with the first value in the list and the maximum with the last value in the list. If none of these conditions are met, it assumes the trend is stable. The function returns a named tuple with the calculated values for average, maximum, minimum, and the determined trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,293],"elapsed":9.320627516,"_type":"aimessage"}]
