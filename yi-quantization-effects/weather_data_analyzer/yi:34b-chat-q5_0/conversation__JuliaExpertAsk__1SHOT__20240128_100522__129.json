If the list is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. The trend is determined based on the standard deviation of the temperature data. If the standard deviation is 0, the trend is considered stable. If there is a significant difference between the maximum and minimum temperatures (arbitrarily set to more than 2 degrees for this example), and if the mean temperature falls above or below the midpoint of the range, then an increasing or decreasing trend is indicated, respectively. Otherwise, the trend is also considered stable.","status":200,"tokens":[0,434],"elapsed":13.872322455,"_type":"aimessage"}]
