Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    mean_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    std_dev = std(temps)\n    median_temp = median(temps)\n\n    # Check for trend using simple linear regression\n    x = 1:length(temps) # Time series index\n    y = temps           # Temperatures\n    coef, _, r, _ = fit(LinearModel, x => y)\n    slope = coef[1]     # Slope of the line\n\n    if slope > 0.0\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif slope < 0.0\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (average=mean_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Statistics` package to calculate the average (`mean`), maximum (`maximum`), and minimum (`minimum`) temperatures. It also calculates the standard deviation (`std`) and median (`median`) for additional insight into the data.\n\nFor the trend analysis, a simple linear regression is performed using the `fit` function from the `LinearAlgebra` package. The slope of the line is calculated using the first coefficient (`coef[1]`). If the slope is positive, the trend is considered increasing; if it's negative, the trend is decreasing; and if it's close to zero (or the data points are not linearly correlated), the trend is considered stable.\n\nPlease note that for a more robust trend analysis, other methods such as moving averages or more advanced statistical techniques might be used. However, this simple approach can provide a quick initial assessment of the temperature trends.","status":200,"tokens":[0,450],"elapsed":14.390917232,"_type":"aimessage"}]
