Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package).

Below is an example of how you might define the `weather_data_analyzer` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    mean_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Calculate the temperature trend using the mean of each pair of consecutive elements\n    # and check if the differences are increasing, decreasing, or stable.\n    differences = [mean_temp[i+1] - mean_temp[i] for i in 2:length(temps)-1]\n    trend = if all(differences .> 0)\n        :increasing\n    elseif all(differences .< 0)\n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n\n    return (average=mean_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ntemps = [25, 30, 28, 26, 27] # Sample temperature data\nresult = weather_data_analyzer(temps)\nprintln(\"Average temperature: $(result.average)\")\nprintln(\"Maximum temperature: $(result.max)\")\nprintln(\"Minimum temperature: $(result.min)\")\nprintln(\"Temperature trend: $(result.trend)\")\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list of temperatures is empty. If it is, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. If there is data, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using functions from the `Statistics` package.\n\nTo determine the trend, the function calculates the mean of each pair of consecutive elements in the list and stores these means in a new array called `mean_temp`. It then finds the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in this new array and checks if all of them are positive (increasing), negative (decreasing), or neither (stable). The trend is then assigned accordingly.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes the temperatures are provided in a list or vector. If you have the data in a different format, you may need to adapt the function to accommodate that structure.","status":200,"tokens":[0,557],"elapsed":16.227375327,"_type":"aimessage"}]
