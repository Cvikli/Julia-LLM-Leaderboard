It also uses a simple linear regression model to determine the temperature trend over time. The `linreg` function is defined in the `LinearAlgebra` package and returns the slope (`slope`), intercept (`intercept`), correlation coefficient (`r`), p-value (`p`), and standard error of the estimate (`se`) for a linear regression model.\n\nThe trend is determined based on the significance of the slope (using the p-value). If the p-value is less than 0.05, it indicates that there is enough evidence to suggest that the relationship between the temperature and time is not due to chance. The sign of the slope determines whether the trend is increasing or decreasing. If the slope is not significant, the trend is considered stable.\n\nIf the list `temps` is empty, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,432],"elapsed":12.284701328,"_type":"aimessage"}]
