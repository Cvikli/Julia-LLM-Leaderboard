Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    # Calculate statistics\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max = maximum(temps)\n    min = minimum(temps)\n    std_dev = std(temps)\n    \n    # Determine trend (only increasing, decreasing, or stable)\n    if std_dev == 0 # No variation, so stable\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif all(temps[1:end-1] .< temps[2:end]) # Increasing\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(temps[1:end-1] .> temps[2:end]) # Decreasing\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        # No clear trend (some variation but not consistently increasing or decreasing)\n        trend = nothing\n    end\n\n    return (average=average, max=max, min=min, trend=trend)\nend\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22]) # Example usage\n```\n\nPlease note that the `trend` is determined based on a simple heuristic: if there's no variation in the data (standard deviation equals zero), it's considered stable; otherwise, if all temperatures except the first are either strictly greater or strictly less than the previous one, it's considered increasing or decreasing, respectively.
