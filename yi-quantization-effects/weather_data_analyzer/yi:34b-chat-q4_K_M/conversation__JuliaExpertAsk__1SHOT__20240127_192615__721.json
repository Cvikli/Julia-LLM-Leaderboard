Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max = maximum(temps)\n    min = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Calculate the trend using a simple linear regression model\n    ŷ = fit(LinearModel, temps, intercept=false).params[1]\n    if ŷ > 0\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif ŷ < 0\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (average = average, max = max, min = min, trend = trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Statistics` package to calculate the mean (average), maximum, and minimum temperatures. For the trend analysis, a simple linear regression model is fitted using the `LinearModel` type from the `LinearAlgebra` standard library. The slope of this line is then used to determine if the temperature data shows an increasing, decreasing, or stable trend. If the slope is significantly different from zero, the trend is considered to be either increasing or decreasing; otherwise, it is considered stable.","status":200,"tokens":[186,288],"elapsed":8.373125183,"_type":"aimessage"}]
