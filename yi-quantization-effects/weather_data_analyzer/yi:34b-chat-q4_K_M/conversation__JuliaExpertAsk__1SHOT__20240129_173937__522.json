The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`).

It then calculates the difference between the first and last elements of the list, which is used to determine the trend (whether the temperature is increasing, decreasing, or stable). A threshold of 0.5 degrees is used to decide if the change is significant enough to consider it a trend; this is arbitrary and can be adjusted based on the specific requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,290],"elapsed":8.416221424,"_type":"aimessage"}]
