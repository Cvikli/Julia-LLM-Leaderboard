Calculates the average temperature using `mean()`.\n2. Finds the maximum temperature using `maximum()`.\n3. Finds the minimum temperature using `minimum()`.\n4. Determines the trend by calculating the average of consecutive differences in temperatures and checking if it's positive, negative, or close to zero.\n\nIf the list is empty, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing` as specified. The `trend` can be one of `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`.","status":200,"tokens":[156,371],"elapsed":10.717823269,"_type":"aimessage"}]
