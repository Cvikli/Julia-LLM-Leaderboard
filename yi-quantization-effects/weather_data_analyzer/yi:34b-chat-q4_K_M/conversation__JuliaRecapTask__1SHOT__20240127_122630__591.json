[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers).

For the trend analysis, it performs a simple linear regression using the `LinearModel` type from the `GLM` (Generalized Linear Models) package and checks the p-value of the slope. If the p-value is less than 0.05, which is a common threshold for statistical significance, the function classifies the trend as increasing, decreasing, or stable based on the sign of the slope. If there's no significant linear trend, it returns `:stable`. If the list is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\nPlease note that the `fit` function from the `GLM` package requires at least two data points for the regression to be meaningful, so if there's only one temperature value provided, the trend will be classified as `:insufficient_data`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,453],"elapsed":13.092485727,"_type":"aimessage"}]
