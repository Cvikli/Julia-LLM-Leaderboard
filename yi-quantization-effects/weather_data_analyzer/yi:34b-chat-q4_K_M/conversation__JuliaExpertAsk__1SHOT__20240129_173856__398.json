If not empty, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `Statistics` package's `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions. For the trend, it assumes a stable trend if the difference between the maximum and minimum temperatures is less than a certain threshold (10 degrees in this example). Otherwise, it classifies the trend as increasing or decreasing based on the sign of the difference. This is a simplified approach for determining the trend and may not be suitable for all scenarios. For more accurate trend analysis, you would need to perform additional statistical tests or look at the data over longer time periods.","status":200,"tokens":[0,400],"elapsed":11.633001438,"_type":"aimessage"}]
