Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{Float64})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    mean_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Calculate the trend using the first and last element of the vector\n    # If they are equal, the trend is stable\n    first_temp = temps[1]\n    last_temp = temps[end]\n    trend = if first_temp == last_temp\n        :stable\n    elseif first_temp < last_temp\n        :increasing\n    else\n        :decreasing\n    end\n\n    return (average=mean_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ntemps = [20, 25, 30] # Assume this is a list of daily temperatures\nresult = weather_data_analyzer(temps)\nprintln(\"Average temperature: $(result.average)\")\nprintln(\"Maximum temperature: $(result.max)\")\nprintln(\"Minimum temperature: $(result.min)\")\nprintln(\"Temperature trend: $(result.trend)\")\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Statistics` package to calculate the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures. For the trend analysis, it compares the first and last elements of the vector. If they are equal, the trend is considered stable; otherwise, if the first element is less than the last, the trend is increasing, and if the first element is greater than the last, the trend is decreasing. If the list is empty, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing` as specified in the task.","status":200,"tokens":[0,418],"elapsed":11.90177985,"_type":"aimessage"}]
