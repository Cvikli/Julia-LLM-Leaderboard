The trend is determined by comparing the mean temperature to the first and last value in the list. If the mean differs from the first or last value by more than 1 degree, it is considered to be in an increasing or decreasing trend, respectively. Otherwise, the trend is considered stable.","status":200,"tokens":[0,294],"elapsed":7.796753646,"_type":"aimessage"}]
