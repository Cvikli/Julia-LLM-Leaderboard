Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{T}) where T<:Real\n    n = length(temps)\n    if n == 0\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    trend = if avg == max_temp && avg != min_temp\n        :stable\n      elseif avg > min_temp\n        :increasing\n      else\n        :decreasing\n      end\n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ntemps = [25, 27, 23, 20, 22]\nweather_data_analyzer(temps)  # Output will be a named tuple with the calculated statistics\n```\n\nThe function `weather_data_analyzer` first checks if the list of temperatures is empty. If so, it returns a named tuple with all fields set to `nothing`. If the list has data, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package. The trend is determined based on whether the average temperature matches the maximum (no change) or if there is a clear increasing or decreasing pattern.","status":200,"tokens":[290,340],"elapsed":14.830501322,"_type":"aimessage"}]
