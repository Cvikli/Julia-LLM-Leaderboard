The trend is determined by calculating the change in temperature from one day to the next and counting how many times the changes are positive or negative. If there are significantly more positive changes than negative, the trend is considered increasing; if there are significantly more negative changes than positive, it's decreasing; otherwise, it's stable.\n\nNote that this function assumes you have already imported the `Statistics` package. You can use the function like this:\n\n```julia\ntemps = [20, 21, 23, 25] # Example temperatures list\nresult = weather_data_analyzer(temps)\nprintln(\"Average temperature: \", result.average)\nprintln(\"Maximum temperature: \", result.max)\nprintln(\"Minimum temperature: \", result.min)\nprintln(\"Temperature trend: \", result.trend)\n```\n\nIf you call this function with an empty list or a list containing only `NaN` values, it will return a named tuple with all fields set to `nothing`, as specified in the problem statement.","status":200,"tokens":[0,592],"elapsed":15.778200384,"_type":"aimessage"}]
