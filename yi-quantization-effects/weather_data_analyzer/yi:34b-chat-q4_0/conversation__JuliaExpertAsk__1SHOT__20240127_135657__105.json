The trend is determined by looking at the variation in temperature across the dataset. If there's no variation (all temperatures are equal), the trend is considered stable. Otherwise, it looks at the last few elements of the list to determine if the temperatures are increasing or decreasing.","status":200,"tokens":[0,297],"elapsed":7.860832825,"_type":"aimessage"}]
