If the list is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. The function uses both `mean` and `median` to determine the trend, with the assumption that if the mean is less than the median, the temperature is decreasing, and vice versa for an increasing trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,239],"elapsed":6.124659881,"_type":"aimessage"}]
