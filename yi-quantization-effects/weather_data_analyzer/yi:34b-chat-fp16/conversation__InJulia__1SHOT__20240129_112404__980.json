If it is, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. If not, it calculates the average (`mean`), maximum (`maximum`), and minimum (`minimum`) temperatures from the data. It also computes the standard deviation (`std`), which is used to determine the trend in the temperature data.\n\nThe trend is determined based on whether the standard deviation is zero (stable) or if the difference between the mean and the maximum/minimum temperatures indicates an increasing or decreasing trend. The function returns a named tuple with the calculated average, maximum, minimum temperatures, and the trend as a symbol.","status":200,"tokens":[0,489],"elapsed":38.007476129,"_type":"aimessage"}]
