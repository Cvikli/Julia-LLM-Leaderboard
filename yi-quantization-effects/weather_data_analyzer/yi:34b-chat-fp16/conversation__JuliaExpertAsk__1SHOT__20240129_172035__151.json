Calculates the average temperature using `mean()`.\n2. Finds the maximum temperature using `maximum()`.\n3. Identifies the minimum temperature using `minimum()`.\n4. Computes the standard deviation using `std()`.\n5. If there is more than one data point, it performs a simple linear regression to determine the trend (using the `linreg` function from the `LinearAlgebra` package). The trend is determined based on the slope of the regression line and the p-value. A p-value less than 0.05 indicates statistical significance, so if the slope is significantly different from zero, the trend is classified as increasing or decreasing accordingly; otherwise, it's considered stable.\n6. If there is only one data point, the trend is set to `:single_data_point` to indicate that no meaningful trend can be determined with a single observation.\n7. If the list is empty, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\nThe function returns the results in a named tuple using the `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax, which is one of the ways to construct a dictionary in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[0,551],"elapsed":42.911532151,"_type":"aimessage"}]
