Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{Float64})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    mean_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    std_temp = std(temps)\n\n    # Calculate the trend using the standard deviation.

It also determines the trend based on the standard deviation of the temperatures. If the standard deviation is zero, indicating no variation in the data, the trend is considered stable. Otherwise, it checks if the last temperature is higher than the first (or lower for a decreasing trend) and sets the trend accordingly. If there's no clear pattern, the trend is also set to stable.","status":200,"tokens":[0,410],"elapsed":31.92659614,"_type":"aimessage"}]
