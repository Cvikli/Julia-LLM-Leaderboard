Here's how you can write this function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    mean_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Calculate the trend. For simplicity, we'll assume that if the standard deviation is\n    # small compared to the average, the temperature is stable; otherwise it's either increasing or decreasing.\n    std_temp = std(temps)\n    if std_temp / mean_temp < 0.1 # This threshold can be adjusted based on your requirements\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif (mean_temp - min_temp) > (max_temp - mean_temp)\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n\n    return (average = mean_temp, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = trend)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ntemps = [20, 25, 30, 35] # Assuming this is your list of daily temperature data\nresult = weather_data_analyzer(temps)\nprintln(\"Average temperature: \", result.average)\nprintln(\"Maximum temperature: \", result.max)\nprintln(\"Minimum temperature: \", result.min)\nprintln(\"Temperature trend: \", result.trend)\n```\n\nIn this example, we use the `Statistics` package to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the temperatures. The threshold used to determine if the temperature is stable (0.1 in this case) is arbitrary and can be adjusted based on your specific requirements. If the standard deviation is less than 10% of the average temperature, we consider the trend to be stable; otherwise, we check whether the difference between the mean and minimum temperatures is greater than the difference between the maximum and mean temperatures to determine if the trend is increasing or decreasing.\n\nPlease note that this function provides a very basic trend analysis. For more sophisticated analyses, you might want to use other statistical methods or machine learning techniques.","status":200,"tokens":[0,551],"elapsed":42.861336513,"_type":"aimessage"}]
