It also calculates the standard deviation (`std`) and variance (`var`) to determine the `trend` of the temperature data. The trend is determined based on a simple method: if the standard deviation is less than the mean, it's considered stable; if it's increasing or decreasing, it's labeled accordingly. If there's no variance (i.e., all temperatures are the same), the trend is set to `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,359],"elapsed":27.880885079,"_type":"aimessage"}]
