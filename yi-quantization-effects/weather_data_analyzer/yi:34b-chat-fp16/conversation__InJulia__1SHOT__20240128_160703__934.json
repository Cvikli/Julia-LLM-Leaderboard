The trend is determined by calculating the average difference between each pair of consecutive temperature values in the list. If the average difference is positive, the trend is considered increasing; if it's negative, the trend is decreasing; otherwise, it's stable.\n\nIf the list is empty, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,442],"elapsed":34.330561453,"_type":"aimessage"}]
