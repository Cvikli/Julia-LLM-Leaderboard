Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{Float64})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    diffs = [t - avg for t in temps]\n    is_increasing = all(d > 0 for d in diffs[1:end-1]) || (diffs[end] > 0 && sum(d for d in diffs) > 0)\n    is_decreasing = all(d < 0 for d in diffs[1:end-1]) || (diffs[end] < 0 && sum(d for d in diffs) < 0)\n    trend = is_increasing ? :increasing : (is_decreasing ? :decreasing : :stable)\n\n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])  # Example usage\n```\n\nPlease note that the `trend` is determined based on a simple increasing/decreasing pattern detection.
