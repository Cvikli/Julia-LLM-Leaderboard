Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    m2c = 35.0 # conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit (assuming Kelvin is used, as in real life)\n    trend = if std(temps) / length(temps) > 1e-4\n        :increasing\n    elseif std(temps) / length(temps) < -1e-4\n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n\n    return (average = average, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Statistics` package to calculate the mean (`average`) and the standard deviation of the temperatures. It also finds the maximum (`max`) and minimum (`min`) values in the list. The `trend` is determined by comparing the standard deviation to a very small number, which is essentially a threshold for statistical significance. If the temperature variations are greater than this threshold, we consider the trend to be either increasing or decreasing; otherwise, it's considered stable.","status":200,"tokens":[0,305],"elapsed":23.667049023,"_type":"aimessage"}]
