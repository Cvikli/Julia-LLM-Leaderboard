It also calculates the difference in days between each pair of consecutive temperatures and then computes the slope of the temperature changes over time using a simple linear regression approach. The `trend` is determined based on the sign of the slope, indicating whether the temperatures are increasing, decreasing, or stable (if the slope is close to zero). If the list of temperatures is empty, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,317],"elapsed":24.618526821,"_type":"aimessage"}]
