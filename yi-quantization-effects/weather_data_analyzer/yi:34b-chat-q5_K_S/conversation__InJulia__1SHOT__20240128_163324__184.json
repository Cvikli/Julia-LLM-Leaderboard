The function will also determine if the temperature trend is increasing, decreasing, or stable based on the difference between consecutive values in the list.\n\nHere's how you can define the function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::AbstractVector{<:Real})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = :stable)\n    end\n\n    avg_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Calculate the temperature trend using the differences between consecutive temperatures\n    diffs = [t2 - t1 for (t1, t2) in zip(temps[1:end-1], temps[2:end])]\n    trend = if sum(diffs) > 0\n        :increasing\n    elseif sum(diffs) < 0\n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n\n    return (average = avg_temp, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of daily temperature data `temps` and returns a named tuple with the average, maximum, minimum temperatures, and the trend. If the list is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing` as specified.\n\nTo use this function, you would simply call it with your list of temperature data:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\ntemps = [10, 20, 30, 40] # This could be a CSV file or any other source\nweather_data_analyzer(temps)\n```\n\nThis will return something like this:\n\n```julia\n(average = 25.0, max = 40.0, min = 10.0, trend = :increasing)\n```\n\nIf you want to use a different source of temperature data, such as a CSV file, you can read the CSV into a vector of temperatures using `CSV.read` or `readdlm` and then pass that vector to the `weather_data_analyzer` function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,540],"elapsed":17.276338958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
