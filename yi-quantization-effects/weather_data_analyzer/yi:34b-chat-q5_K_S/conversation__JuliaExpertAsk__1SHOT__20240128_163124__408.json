It also calculates a simple linear trend using the second differences of the means. The threshold value of 0.5 is arbitrary and could be changed based on the specific requirements. If there are no data points or if the change in temperature over time is very small (less than 0.5), the function considers the trend to be stable. Otherwise, it classifies the trend as increasing or decreasing.","status":200,"tokens":[186,362],"elapsed":11.729251716,"_type":"aimessage"}]
