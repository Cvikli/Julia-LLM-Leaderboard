Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{Float64})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n    mean_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    # Checking for temperature trend using the first differences method (simple approach)\n    diffs = temps[2:end] .- temps[1:(end - 1)]  # Calculate differences between consecutive temperatures\n    if all(diffs .> 0) # Increasing trend\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(diffs .< 0) # Decreasing trend\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else # Stable trend (no consistent increase or decrease)\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    return (average = mean_temp, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = trend)\nend\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])  # Example usage\n```\n\nThis function follows the provided steps:\n\n1. Think through your approach step by step: The function first checks if the list is empty and returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing` in that case. For a non-empty list, it calculates the mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures using built-in functions from the `Statistics` package. To determine the trend, it uses the first differences method, which compares consecutive temperatures and checks if they are all positive (increasing), negative (decreasing), or neither (stable).\n\n2. Write any functions and other code you need: The function defines a helper variable `diffs` to store the differences between consecutive temperatures. It then uses logical array operations to determine the trend.\n\n3. Solve the task: The function calculates the necessary statistics and trends based on the provided approach.\n\n4. Check that your solution is correct: The function ensures that all cases (empty list, increasing, decreasing, and stable trends) are covered with appropriate checks and returns.","status":200,"tokens":[0,482],"elapsed":15.503510768,"_type":"aimessage"}]
