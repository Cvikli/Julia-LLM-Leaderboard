If the list is empty, it returns a named tuple where all values are `nothing`. The trend is determined using the first difference method, which compares the first and last temperature values in the list. If there's only one data point or the length of the list is 2 (as in a tie), the trend is set to `nothing` because it cannot be determined with certainty based on the provided information.","status":200,"tokens":[0,408],"elapsed":13.009210159,"_type":"aimessage"}]
