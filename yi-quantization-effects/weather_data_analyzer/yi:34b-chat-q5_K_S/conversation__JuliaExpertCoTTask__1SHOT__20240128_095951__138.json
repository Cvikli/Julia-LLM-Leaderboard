Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n    mean_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    # Assuming a linear trend for simplicity\n    trend = if mean_temp == max_temp || mean_temp == min_temp\n        :stable\n    elseif (max_temp - min_temp) / length(temps) > 0.1  # arbitrary threshold for increasing/decreasing trend\n        if isapprox(mean(abs(temps[2:end] - temps[1:(end-1)])), 0) || abs(mean(temps)) < abs(mean(temps[1:(end-1)]))\n            :increasing  # increasing if the average temperature is positive and decreasing otherwise\n        else\n            :decreasing\n        end\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n    return (average = mean_temp, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = trend)\nend\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])  # Example usage\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,305],"elapsed":9.762563862,"_type":"aimessage"}]
