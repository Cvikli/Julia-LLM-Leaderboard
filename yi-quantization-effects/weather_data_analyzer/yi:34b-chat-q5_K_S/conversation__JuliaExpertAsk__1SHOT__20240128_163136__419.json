For the temperature trend analysis, it calculates the slope of a simple linear regression model using the `LinearAlgebra` and `StatsModels` packages. The threshold used to determine if the trend is increasing or decreasing is arbitrary; you would adjust this based on your specific use case. If the list is empty, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing` as required.","status":200,"tokens":[0,389],"elapsed":12.418937201,"_type":"aimessage"}]
