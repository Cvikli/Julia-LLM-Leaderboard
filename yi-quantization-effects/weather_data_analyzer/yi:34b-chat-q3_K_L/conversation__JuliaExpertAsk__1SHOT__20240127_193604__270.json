Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{Float64})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Calculate temperature trend using linear regression\n    X = ones(length(temps))  # X-axis data for the regression line: time (e.g., days)\n    Y = temps                # Y-axis data for the regression line: temperature\n    regression_result = fit(LinearRegression, X, Y)\n    slope = regression_result.params[1]\n    intercept = regression_result.params[2]\n    r² = regression_result.rsquared\n\n    if slope > 0 && r² >= 0.95\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif slope < 0 && r² >= 0.95\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (average = avg_temp, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Statistics` package for calculating the average and maximum/minimum temperatures. For the temperature trend, it performs a linear regression using the `LinearRegression` method from the `StatsModels` package (since Julia 1.0, this is imported by `using Statistics`). The `fit` function calculates the slope of the line of best fit, and based on the slope and the R² value, the trend is determined as either increasing, decreasing, or stable.","status":200,"tokens":[0,393],"elapsed":10.889807024,"_type":"aimessage"}]
