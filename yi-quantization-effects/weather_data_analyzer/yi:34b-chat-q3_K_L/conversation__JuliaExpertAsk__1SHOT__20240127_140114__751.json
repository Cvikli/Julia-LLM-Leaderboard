It also checks for the standard deviation (`std`) to determine if there is a clear increasing or decreasing trend in the data. If the standard deviation is zero, which means all values are equal, it classifies the trend as stable. Otherwise, it compares the mean temperature to the minimum and maximum temperatures to decide on an increasing or decreasing trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,279],"elapsed":7.709625028,"_type":"aimessage"}]
