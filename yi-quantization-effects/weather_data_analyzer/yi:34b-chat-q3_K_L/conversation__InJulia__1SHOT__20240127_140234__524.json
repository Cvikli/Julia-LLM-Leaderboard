Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can use the `Statistics` package to perform basic statistical analyses on a list of daily temperature data. Here's how you can define the `weather_data_analyzer` function that calculates the average, maximum, minimum temperatures and determines the trend:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    # Calculate average, maximum, and minimum temperatures\n    mean_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Determine the trend using a simple method: Check if the last value is higher or lower than the first\n    first_temp = temps[1]\n    last_temp = temps[end]\n    if first_temp < last_temp\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif first_temp > last_temp\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (average=mean_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ntemps = [20, 15, 18, 23]  # This is an example of daily temperature data\nweather_data_analyzer(temps)  # Call the function with your list of temperatures\n```\n\nPlease note that this `weather_data_analyzer` function uses a very basic method to determine the trend. In practice, you would likely use more sophisticated statistical methods (such as linear regression or more advanced time series analysis techniques) to determine the trend accurately. However, for the purpose of this example, the simple approach shown here is sufficient.","status":200,"tokens":[0,404],"elapsed":11.163681018,"_type":"aimessage"}]
