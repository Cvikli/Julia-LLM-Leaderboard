Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{Float64})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    # You can add additional checks here to determine the trend (e.g., use a rolling window or linear regression)\n    trend = if average > min_temp && average < max_temp\n        :stable\n    elseif average == max_temp\n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :increasing\n    end\n\n    return (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Statistics` package to calculate the mean and the minimum/maximum temperatures. For the trend, a simple check is implemented based on the average temperature compared to the maximum and minimum temperatures. This method assumes that if the average temperature is outside of the range defined by the minimum and maximum temperatures, it indicates either an increasing or decreasing trend. Otherwise, it's considered stable.\n\nPlease note that this is a simplified approach for demonstration purposes. In practice, you might want to use more sophisticated methods to determine the trend, such as linear regression or other time series analysis techniques.","status":200,"tokens":[186,312],"elapsed":8.799019328,"_type":"aimessage"}]
