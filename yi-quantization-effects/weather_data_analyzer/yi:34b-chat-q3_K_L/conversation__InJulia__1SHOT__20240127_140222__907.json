Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`).

Below is an example of how you might define such a function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::AbstractVector{T}) where T <: Real\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = :stable)\n    end\n\n    mean_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Calculate the difference between each pair of consecutive elements in the vector\n    diffs = diff(temps)\n    # If all differences are non-positive, it's decreasing; if all are non-negative, it's increasing\n    if all(x -> x <= 0, diffs)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif all(x -> x >= 0, diffs)\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        # If there are both positive and negative differences, trend is stable\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (average = mean_temp, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of temperatures `temps` and returns a named tuple with the average, maximum, minimum temperatures, and a trend indicator. If the list is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\nTo use this function, you would simply call it with your list of temperature data:\n\n```julia\ntemps = [20, 21, 22, 23] # Example temperature data\nresult = weather_data_analyzer(temps)\nprintln(\"Average temperature: $(result.average)\")\nprintln(\"Maximum temperature: $(result.max)\")\nprintln(\"Minimum temperature: $(result.min)\")\nprintln(\"Trend: $(result.trend)\")\n```\n\nThis will output something like:\n\n```\nAverage temperature: 21.5\nMaximum temperature: 23\nMinimum temperature: 20\nTrend: increasing\n```\n\nRemember that the `trend` will be `stable` if there are both positive and negative differences in the temperatures, or if there is no clear pattern of increase or decrease.","status":200,"tokens":[0,539],"elapsed":14.961474945,"_type":"aimessage"}]
