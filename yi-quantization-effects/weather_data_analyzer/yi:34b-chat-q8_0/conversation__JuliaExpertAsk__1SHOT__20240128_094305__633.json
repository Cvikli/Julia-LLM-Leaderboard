If the list is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. The trend analysis is based on the difference between consecutive temperatures in the sorted list; if all differences are positive (or negative), the trend is considered increasing (or decreasing), else the trend is stable.","status":200,"tokens":[0,335],"elapsed":15.08118641,"_type":"aimessage"}]
