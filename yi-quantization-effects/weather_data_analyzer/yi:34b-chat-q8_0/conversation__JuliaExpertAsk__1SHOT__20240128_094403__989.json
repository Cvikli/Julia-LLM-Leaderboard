The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`).

It also performs a simple linear regression to determine the trend in the temperature data. If there is no variation in the data (i.e., standard deviation and variance are zero), the trend is considered stable. Otherwise, if the slope of the linear model is positive, the trend is increasing; if it's negative, the trend is decreasing; and if the slope is zero, the trend is stable with no linear trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,400],"elapsed":18.036261731,"_type":"aimessage"}]
