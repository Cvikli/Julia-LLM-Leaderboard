To determine the trend, it calculates the absolute differences of each temperature from the first temperature in the list and checks whether they increase or decrease consistently. If none of the trends are clearly visible, it classifies the data as stable. The `trend` can only be `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`.","status":200,"tokens":[186,332],"elapsed":9.019960314,"_type":"aimessage"}]
