Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    # Calculate statistics\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Check trend using simple linear regression (if there's at least two data points)\n    n = length(temps)\n    if n > 1\n        x_values = 1:n\n        y_values = temps\n        regression = fit(LinearModel, x_values, y_values)[2]\n        slope = regression.coefficients[1]\n        trend = ifelse(abs(slope) < 1e-6, :stable, slope > 0 ? :increasing : :decreasing)\n    else\n        trend = :na # Not applicable with only one data point\n    end\n\n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,259],"elapsed":6.910207718,"_type":"aimessage"}]
