Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction weatherDataAnalyzer(temps::Vector{Float64})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    stat_results = Statistics.mean(temps), Statistics.maximum(temps), Statistics.minimum(temps)\n    trend_checker = temps[2] > temps[1] ? :increasing : (temps[2] < temps[1] ? :decreasing : :stable)\n\n    return (; average=stat_results[1], max=stat_results[2], min=stat_results[3], trend=trend_checker)\nend\n```\n\nThis function calculates the average (`mean`), maximum (`maximum`), and minimum (`minimum`) temperatures from the given list of temperatures `temps`. It then checks for the trend by comparing the first two elements of the list; if the second temperature is higher than the first one, it's an increasing trend, otherwise decreasing. If both are equal, it's considered a stable trend. If the list is empty, the function returns a named tuple with `nothing` values for all keys.","status":200,"tokens":[0,272],"elapsed":7.244425185,"_type":"aimessage"}]
