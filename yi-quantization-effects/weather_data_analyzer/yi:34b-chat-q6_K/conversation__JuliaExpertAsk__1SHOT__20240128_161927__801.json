It also calculates the standard deviation (`std`) of the temperatures. To determine the temperature trend, it performs a simple linear regression using the `LinearModel` from the `StatsPlots` package (which is imported implicitly through `LinearAlgebra` due to Julia's multiple dispatch mechanism). The function checks if the slope of the regression line is close to zero within a certain threshold to determine if the trend is stable, increasing, or decreasing.","status":200,"tokens":[186,354],"elapsed":13.362693617,"_type":"aimessage"}]
