Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    mean_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    std_dev = std(temps)\n    is_increasing = all(temps[2:end] .>= temps[1:(end-1)])  # Check if each temp is greater than the previous one\n    is_decreasing = all(temps[2:end] .<= temps[1:(end-1)])  # Check if each temp is less than the previous one\n    is_stable = !is_increasing && !is_decreasing            # Check if neither increasing nor decreasing\n\n    trend = if is_increasing\n        \":increasing\"\n    elseif is_decreasing\n        \":decreasing\"\n    else\n        \":stable\"\n    end\n\n    return (; average=mean_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Statistics` package for calculating the mean and the standard deviation of the temperatures. It also checks if the temperatures are increasing, decreasing, or stable by comparing each temperature to the previous one. The `is_increasing` and `is_decreasing` functions ensure that every temperature is greater than or less than the previous one, respectively. If neither condition is met, the trend is considered \"stable\". The function returns a named tuple with the average, maximum, minimum temperatures, and the trend as a string indicating the direction of change.","status":200,"tokens":[0,388],"elapsed":14.463047928,"_type":"aimessage"}]
