Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    # Convert the DateTime to a POSIX timestamp\n    timestamp = Dates.unix2datetime(Dates.datetime2unix(dt))\n    \n    # Bump the timestamp by the specified number of hours\n    new_timestamp = timestamp + (bump * Hour(1))\n    \n    # Convert the bumped timestamp back to a DateTime object and return it\n    return Dates.unix2datetime(Dates.datetime2unix(new_timestamp))\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first converting the `DateTime` to an integer Unix timestamp using `Dates.datetime2unix()`, which is more efficient for arithmetic operations. It then adds the specified number of hours to this timestamp using vector addition and a conversion factor (since Unix timestamps are in seconds). Finally, it converts the bumped timestamp back into a `DateTime` object using `Dates.unix2datetime()` and returns it.\n\nTo ensure that the function works only with `DateTime` types and not `Date` types, you can add a check at the beginning of the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Union{DateTime, Date}, bump::Int = 3)\n    if isa(dt, Date)\n        throw(DomainError(\"timezone_bumper cannot be applied to Date type. Use DateTime instead.\"))\n    end\n    # Rest of the function code here\n```\n\nThis check throws a `DomainError` if someone tries to pass a `Date` object to the function, indicating that only `DateTime` objects are supported.","status":200,"tokens":[0,371],"elapsed":28.811212968,"_type":"aimessage"}]
