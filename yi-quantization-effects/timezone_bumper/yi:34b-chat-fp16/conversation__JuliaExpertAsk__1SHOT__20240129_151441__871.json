It then bumps the hour of the `DateTime` by the specified number of hours (`bump`) or the default value of 3 hours if no argument is provided. The other components of the `DateTime` (minute, second, millisecond) are preserved, and the time zone offset is recalculated based on the new hour.","status":200,"tokens":[0,204],"elapsed":15.797475284,"_type":"aimessage"}]
