Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    # Convert the DateTime to a TimeType to adjust just the time part\n    time = Time(dt)\n    \n    # Adjust the time by the specified number of hours\n    new_time = time + Duration(bump, Unitful.Hour)\n    \n    # Convert the adjusted time back to a DateTime and return it\n    return DateTime(new_time, date=Date(dt))\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a `DateTime` object `dt` and adjusts it by `bump` hours. If no `bump` is provided, it defaults to adding 3 hours. It works by first converting the `DateTime` to a `TimeType` using `Time(dt)`, which only contains the time part of the `DateTime` without the date information. Then, it adjusts this time by the specified number of hours using `Duration` from the `Unitful` package (which is necessary for working with units like hours). Finally, it converts the adjusted time back to a `DateTime` by providing the original date and returns the new `DateTime` object.\n\nTo ensure that the function works only with `DateTime` types and throws an error for `Date` types, you can add a type assertion:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    # Convert the DateTime to a TimeType to adjust just the time part\n    time = Time(dt)\n    \n    # Adjust the time by the specified number of hours\n    new_time = time + Duration(bump, Unitful.Hour)\n    \n    # Convert the adjusted time back to a DateTime and return it\n    return DateTime(new_time, date=Date(dt))\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int = 3)\n    throw(DomainError(\"Cannot adjust dates with timezone_bumper. Use DateTime type instead.\"))\nend\n```\n\nNow, if you try to pass a `Date` object to the function, it will throw an error explaining that only `DateTime` types are supported.","status":200,"tokens":[0,487],"elapsed":37.789072113,"_type":"aimessage"}]
