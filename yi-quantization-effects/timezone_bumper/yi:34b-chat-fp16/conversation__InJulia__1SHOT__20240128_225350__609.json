Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can define the `timezone_bumper` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    # Check if dt is a DateTime type\n    if !isa(dt, DateTime)\n        error(\"Argument 'dt' must be of type DateTime.\")\n    end\n    \n    # Adjust the time by the specified number of hours\n    new_time = LocalTime(dt) + Hour(bump)\n    \n    # Create a new DateTime object with the adjusted time and original date\n    return DateTime(date(dt), new_time)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes two arguments: `dt` which is a `DateTime` object, and `bump` which is an optional integer specifying the number of hours to add (defaults to +3 hours). It checks if the input `dt` is indeed a `DateTime` type, and throws an error if it's not. It then adjusts the time by adding `Hour(bump)` to the local time component of the `DateTime` object using `LocalTime` which is a subtype of `TimeType` in Julia. Finally, it creates a new `DateTime` object with the adjusted time and the original date of the input `dt`.\n\nTo use this function, you would call it like so:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\n# Example usage\noriginal_time = DateTime(\"2023-01-01T10:00:00Z\")  # Any valid DateTime string will work\nadjusted_time = timezone_bumper(original_time, 5)  # Adjust by 5 hours\nprintln(adjusted_time)  # Output: 2023-01-01T15:00:00Z (assuming UTC)\n```\n\nRemember that the `LocalTime` object represents the time as it would be interpreted in the current system's time zone. When you add or subtract hours from a `LocalTime`, it assumes you are working with the local time zone and adjusts accordingly. Since we are using `DateTime` which has both date and time components, the adjustment is applied to just the time part, leaving the date unchanged.","status":200,"tokens":[0,506],"elapsed":39.270485777,"_type":"aimessage"}]
