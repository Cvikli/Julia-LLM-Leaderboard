If not, it throws an `ArgumentError`. It then increments the local time of the `DateTime` by `bump` hours and creates a new `DateTime` object with the same date as `dt` and the bumped time.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\n# Example DateTime object\ndt = DateTime(2023, 1, 1, 12, 30, 45; tz=\"UTC+2\")\n\n# Increase the timestamp by 5 hours\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, 5)\nprintln(new_dt) # Output: 2023-01-01T17:30:45.000Z (UTC+2 + 5 hours)\n```\n\nNote that the `timezone_bumper` function assumes that `bump` will be positive. If you need to support negative `bump` values, you would need to adjust the logic accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,399],"elapsed":30.949047057,"_type":"aimessage"}]
