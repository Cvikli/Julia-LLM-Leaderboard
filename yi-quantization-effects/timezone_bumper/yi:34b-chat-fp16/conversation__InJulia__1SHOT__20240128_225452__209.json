Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can define the `timezone_bumper` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    if !(isa(dt, DateTime))\n        throw(ErrorException(\"Input must be a DateTime. Got $(typeof(dt)) instead.\"))\n    end\n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes two arguments: `dt` which is a `DateTime` object, and `bump` which is an integer representing the number of hours to add. If `bump` is not provided, it defaults to adding 3 hours. The function checks if the input `dt` is indeed a `DateTime`; if not, it throws an `ErrorException` with an appropriate message.\n\nTo use this function, simply call it with your `DateTime` object and optionally specify the number of hours you want to add:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\n# Example DateTime\ndt = DateTime(2023, 1, 1, 12)  # An example date-time\n\n# Increase the time by 5 hours\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, 5)\nprintln(new_dt)  # Output: 2023-01-01T17:00:00\n```\n\nIf you try to pass a `Date` object instead of a `DateTime`, the function will throw an error as intended:\n\n```julia\ndate = Date(2023, 1, 1)  # A date without time information\ntimezone_bumper(date)   # This will throw an ErrorException\n```\n\nRemember to include `using Dates` at the beginning of your Julia script or in a REPL session for access to the `Dates` module's functions, such as `DateTime` and `Date`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,435],"elapsed":33.728853628,"_type":"aimessage"}]
