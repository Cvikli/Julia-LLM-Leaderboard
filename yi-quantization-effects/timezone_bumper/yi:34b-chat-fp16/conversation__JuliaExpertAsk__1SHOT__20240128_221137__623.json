It checks if the input is of type `Date` and throws an error if so, as the function is meant to operate on `DateTime` types only. It then adds the specified number of hours to the timestamp using the `Duration` constructor with a time unit of \"h\" for hours.","status":200,"tokens":[0,162],"elapsed":12.553605667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
