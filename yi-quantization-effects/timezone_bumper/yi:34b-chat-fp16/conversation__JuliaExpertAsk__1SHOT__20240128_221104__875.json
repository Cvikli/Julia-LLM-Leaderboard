It ensures that the input is of type `DateTime`, and then adjusts the time by adding `bump` hours using the `LocalTime` constructor. Finally, it creates a new `DateTime` object with the adjusted time and the original date of the input `dt`.\n\nThe function also includes a default value for `bump` to make it more user-friendly when calling the function without any arguments.","status":200,"tokens":[0,260],"elapsed":20.166544337,"_type":"aimessage"}]
