[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Integer=3)\n    if !(isa(bump, Integer)) || (bump < 0)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"`bump` must be a non-negative integer. Received $(bump)\"))\n    end\n    return DateTime(Dates.unix2datetime(Dates.datetime2unix(dt) + bump*60*60), tz=Dates.timezone(dt))\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a `DateTime` object and an optional integer `bump` specifying the number of hours to add. If `bump` is not provided or is negative, it throws an `ArgumentError`. The conversion from Unix time (seconds since 1970-01-01) to `DateTime` and back again ensures that the timezone information is preserved during the operation.\n\nTo test this function, you can use the following code:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\ndt = DateTime(2023, 1, 1, tz=\"UTC\") # Example timestamp in UTC\nbump = 5 # Increase by 5 hours\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, bump)\n\nprintln(\"Original date/time: $dt\")\nprintln(\"Bumped date/time:   $new_dt\")\n```\n\nPlease note that this function assumes the timestamp is in UTC. If you need to handle timestamps in other time zones, you will need to provide the correct time zone information when constructing the `DateTime` object.","status":200,"tokens":[0,362],"elapsed":28.293058021,"_type":"aimessage"}]
