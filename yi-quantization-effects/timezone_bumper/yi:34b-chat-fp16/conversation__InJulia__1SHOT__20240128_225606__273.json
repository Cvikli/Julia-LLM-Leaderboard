Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function in Julia that bumps the time of a `DateTime` object by a specified number of hours (`bump`) or by 3 hours if no argument is provided:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    if typeof(dt) == Date\n        throw(DomainError(\"Cannot add time zone offset to a Date object. Use DateTime instead.\"))\n    end\n    return DateTime(year(dt), month(dt), day(dt), hour(dt) + bump, minute(dt), second(dt), millisecond(dt))\nend\n```\n\nThis function checks if the input `dt` is a `Date` object and throws an error if so, as Date objects do not have timezone information. If `dt` is a `DateTime`, it bumps the hour by the specified amount (`bump` hours) and returns the new `DateTime`.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the local timezone offset does not change within the day, which is often not true for locations with daylight saving time (DST) or other complex timezone rules. If you need to handle DST or specific timezones, you would need to use a library like `TimeZones.jl`, which provides more sophisticated timezone handling capabilities in Julia.\n\nTo use the function, simply call it with your `DateTime` object and the number of hours you want to bump:\n\n```julia\njulia> using Dates\n\njulia> dt = DateTime(2023, 1, 1, 12)  # Example date-time\n2023-01-01T12:00:00\n\njulia> timezone_bumper(dt)            # Bump by 3 hours (default)\n2023-01-01T15:00:00\n\njulia> timezone_bumper(dt, 6)         # Bump by 6 hours\n2023-01-01T18:00:00\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,473],"elapsed":36.718866112,"_type":"aimessage"}]
