Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can define the `timezone_bumper` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    # Check if dt is a DateTime type\n    if !isa(dt, DateTime)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be of type DateTime\"))\n    end\n    \n    # Convert the DateTime to a time zone-aware timestamp (UTC value)\n    utc_timestamp = utc(dt)\n    \n    # Bump the UTC timestamp by the specified number of hours\n    new_timestamp = utc_timestamp + Dates.Hour(bump)\n    \n    # Convert the new timestamp back to a DateTime\n    return DateTime(new_timestamp, \"UTC\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a `DateTime` object and an optional integer `bump` representing the number of hours to add. If no `bump` is provided, it defaults to adding 3 hours. The function checks that the input `dt` is indeed a `DateTime` type, converts it to a UTC timestamp, adds the specified number of hours to the timestamp, and then converts back to a `DateTime` object with the same time zone as the original.\n\nTo use this function, simply call it with your `DateTime` object(s) and optionally specify the number of hours you want to add:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\n# Sample DateTime\ndt = DateTime(2023, 1, 1, 12, 0, 0, 000)  # For example, January 1st, 2023 at noon UTC\n\n# Increase the timestamp by 5 hours\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, 5)\n```\n\nIf you try to pass a `Date` object instead of a `DateTime`, an error will be thrown as intended:\n\n```julia\n# This will throw an error\ndate = Date(2023, 1, 1)\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(date)\n```\n\nRemember that this function assumes the input `DateTime` is already in UTC. If your dates are in a different time zone, you would need to convert them to UTC before calling `timezone_bumper`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,514],"elapsed":39.896272333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
