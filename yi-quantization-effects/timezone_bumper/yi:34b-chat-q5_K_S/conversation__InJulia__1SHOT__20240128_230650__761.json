Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function in Julia that bumps the time of a `DateTime` object by a specified number of hours (`bump`):\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    # Convert DateTime to Date and Time components\n    date, time = split(dt)\n    \n    # Add the bump in hours to the time component\n    time += Second(bump * 3600)\n    \n    # Reconstruct the DateTime object from the new date and time components\n    return DateTime(date, time)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `split` method to separate the date and time components of a `DateTime` object. It then adds the specified number of hours to the time component (converted to seconds for convenience) using the `+` operator. Finally, it reconstructs a new `DateTime` object from the updated time and original date components.\n\nBy default, the function bumps the time by 3 hours, but this can be overridden by providing a different value for the `bump` parameter.\n\nTo ensure that the function works only with `DateTime` types and not `Date` types, you can add a guard statement to throw an error if someone tries to pass a `Date` object:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    # Check if dt is a Date instead of DateTime and throw an error\n    if typeof(dt) == Date\n        error(\"timezone_bumper can only be applied to DateTime objects, not Date objects.\")\n    end\n    \n    # Convert DateTime to Date and Time components\n    date, time = split(dt)\n    \n    # Add the bump in hours to the time component\n    time += Second(bump * 3600)\n    \n    # Reconstruct the DateTime object from the new date and time components\n    return DateTime(date, time)\nend\n```\n\nThis additional check ensures that the function will throw an error if someone tries to pass a `Date` object, making it clearer to the user what kind of inputs are expected.","status":200,"tokens":[0,471],"elapsed":14.979681361,"_type":"aimessage"}]
