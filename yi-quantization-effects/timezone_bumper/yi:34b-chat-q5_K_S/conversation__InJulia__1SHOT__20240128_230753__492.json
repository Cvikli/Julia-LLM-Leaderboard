If you try to pass a `Date` type, it will throw an error as follows:\n\n```julia\njulia> timezone_bumper(Date(\"2023-01-01\"))\nERROR: MethodError: no method matching timezone_bumper(::Date; bump=3)\nClosest candidates are:\n  timezone_bumper(::DateTime, ::Integer) at REPL[1]:4\n```\n\nThis is because the `timezone_bumper` function is defined only for `DateTime` types. If you want to handle `Date` types as well, you can define a separate function or overload the existing one to work with both `DateTime` and `Date` types.","status":200,"tokens":[0,403],"elapsed":12.793414756,"_type":"aimessage"}]
