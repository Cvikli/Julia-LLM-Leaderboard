It uses the `unix2datetime` function to convert the Unix timestamp (seconds since 1970-01-01) into a Julia `DateTime` object and then adds the specified number of hours before converting it back to a Unix timestamp using `datetime2unix`. Finally, it re-converts the Unix timestamp to a `DateTime` object and returns the result.\n\nThe function ensures that `bump` is an integer by checking its type with `typeof(bump) <: Integer`. If `bump` is not an integer, an `ArgumentError` is thrown.\n\nFor Date types, the function will throw a `MethodError` because there is no method overload for `timezone_bumper(::Date, ::Int)`. This is intentional and ensures that the function only works with `DateTime` objects as specified in the requirement.","status":200,"tokens":[0,318],"elapsed":10.120510241,"_type":"aimessage"}]
