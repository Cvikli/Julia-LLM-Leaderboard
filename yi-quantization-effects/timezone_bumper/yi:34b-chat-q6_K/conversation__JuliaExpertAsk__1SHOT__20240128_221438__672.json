If not, it throws an `ArgumentError`. It then creates a new `Time` object by adding the `bump` hours to the current time of `dt`. Finally, it returns a new `DateTime` with the bumped time by adding the new `Time` and subtracting the original minute component to ensure the correct second and millisecond values are preserved.\n\nPlease note that this function does not handle daylight saving time changes, which could affect the accuracy of the time adjustment in some regions.","status":200,"tokens":[0,263],"elapsed":9.746172241,"_type":"aimessage"}]
