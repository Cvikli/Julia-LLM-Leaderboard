Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Integer=12)\n    # Convert the DateTime to a Time type so we can adjust the hour value\n    time = Time(dt)\n    # Adjust the hour by the specified bump (default is +3 hours)\n    new_hour = time.hour + bump\n    # Make sure the new hour is within the range of valid hours (0-23)\n    if new_hour < 0\n        new_hour += 24\n    elseif new_hour > 23\n        new_hour -= 24\n    end\n    # Create a new DateTime with the adjusted hour and the same day as the original\n    return DateTime(time.year, time.month, time.day, new_hour, time.minute, time.second, time.millisecond, time.utcoffset)\nend\n```\n\nThis function `timezone_bumper` accepts a `DateTime` object and an optional integer `bump` which specifies the number of hours to add. By default, it bumps by 12 hours (i.e., changes the time zone by 3 hours). It works by converting the `DateTime` to a `Time` type so that we can adjust just the hour value. The adjustment is done within a loop to ensure the new hour is within the valid range (0-23). Finally, it creates a new `DateTime` with the adjusted hour and the same day as the original timestamp.\n\nPlease note that this function does not account for daylight saving time (DST) transitions, which could be important if you are dealing with dates close to DST boundaries. It also assumes that the input `DateTime` is in UTC or has a known offset that can be applied consistently. If you need to handle DST or time zones more generally, you should use the `TimeZones.jl` package.\n\nTo ensure this function works only for `DateTime` types and throws an error for `Date` types, we could define it within a `try-catch` block:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Union{DateTime, Date}, bump::Integer=12)\n    try\n        return timezone_bumper(DateTime(dt), bump)\n    catch e\n        if e isa MethodError && (e.f == DateTime || e.f == Date)\n            throw(DomainError(\"timezone_bumper can only be applied to DateTime types, not $typeof(dt)\"))\n        else\n            rethrow()\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis additional layer of protection ensures that if `DateTime` or `Date` are given as arguments, a `DomainError` is thrown indicating that the function can only operate on `DateTime` types.","status":200,"tokens":[0,613],"elapsed":22.884898195,"_type":"aimessage"}]
