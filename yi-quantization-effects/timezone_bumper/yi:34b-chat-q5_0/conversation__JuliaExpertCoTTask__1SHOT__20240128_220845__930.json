If `dt` is a `DateTime`, it adds the specified number of hours to it using `Duration` with a unit of hours (`:h`).\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)  # Output: DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 15, 0)\ntimezone_bumper(Date(2023, 4, 10))               # Throws an error as Date type is not allowed\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,262],"elapsed":8.337839651,"_type":"aimessage"}]
