It then increments the time by the specified number of hours (`bump`) or defaults to 3 hours if no value is provided for `bump`. The `Dates.value` method is used to get the numeric representation of the date, which is then incremented by the appropriate number of hours before being converted back into a `DateTime` using the `DateTime(...)` constructor.","status":200,"tokens":[0,205],"elapsed":6.498113263,"_type":"aimessage"}]
