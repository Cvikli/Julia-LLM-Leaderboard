[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

It takes a `DateTime` object as input and adds `bump` hours to the `Time` part of the timestamp, leaving the `Date` part unchanged. If no bump is specified, it defaults to adding 3 hours. The function also checks that `bump` is an integer to prevent any type errors.\n\nThe `timezone_bumper` function is designed to work only with `DateTime` types and will throw an error if a `Date` type is provided as input. This behavior is ensured by the type annotation of the parameter `dt::DateTime`, which restricts the function to operate on `DateTime` objects only.\n\nPlease note that this function does not account for daylight saving time changes or any other complexities associated with time zones. It simply adds a fixed number of hours to the input timestamp.","status":200,"tokens":[0,385],"elapsed":12.422076633,"_type":"aimessage"}]
