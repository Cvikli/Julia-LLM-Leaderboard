Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    if typeof(dt) == Date\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"timezone_bumper can only be applied to DateTime objects, not Date objects\"))\n    end\n    return dt + Duration(bump, Unit=\"hours\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function `timezone_bumper` takes a `DateTime` object and an optional integer `bump` which represents the number of hours to increase the timestamp by. If no value is provided for `bump`, it defaults to adding 3 hours. The function works by creating a new `Duration` object with the specified number of hours and then adding this duration to the original `DateTime` object.\n\nThe check using `typeof(dt)` ensures that the input `dt` is indeed a `DateTime` object, and if it's a `Date` object, an `ArgumentError` is thrown with an appropriate message indicating that the function can only operate on `DateTime` objects.","status":200,"tokens":[0,228],"elapsed":7.402769172,"_type":"aimessage"}]
