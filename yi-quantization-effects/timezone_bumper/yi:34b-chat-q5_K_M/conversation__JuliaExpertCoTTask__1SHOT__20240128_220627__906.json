[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

If `bump` is not provided, it defaults to +3 hours. The function returns a new `DateTime` object with the specified time zone bump.\n\nPlease note that the `max_datetime()` function is used to ensure that the resulting date does not exceed the maximum representable datetime in Julia. This is necessary because adding a large number of hours to a date could potentially result in a date that is too far in the future to be represented by the `DateTime` type.\n\nThe function also includes an error check to ensure that the `bump` value does not exceed the valid range for the given date, preventing potential issues with dates that are not valid due to daylight saving time changes or other factors.","status":200,"tokens":[0,298],"elapsed":9.72951329,"_type":"aimessage"}]
