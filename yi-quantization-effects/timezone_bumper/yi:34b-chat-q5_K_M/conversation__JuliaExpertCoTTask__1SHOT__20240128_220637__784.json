It first checks that `bump` is an integer, then ensures that `dt` is also a `DateTime` object. It converts the `bump` into a duration in hours and adds it to the time component of `dt`. Finally, it constructs a new `DateTime` object with the bumped time and the original date.","status":200,"tokens":[0,309],"elapsed":10.094213566,"_type":"aimessage"}]
