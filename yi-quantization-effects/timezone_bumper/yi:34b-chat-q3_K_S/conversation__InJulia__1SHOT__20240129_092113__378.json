Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can define the `timezone_bumper` function within a module to handle both `DateTime` and `Date` types. For `DateTime`, you would simply add the specified hours to the `timestamp` field of the instance. However, for `Date` type, you cannot bump the time, as it does not have a timestamp. Therefore, the function should throw an error if a `Date` type is provided.\n\nHere's how you can define the `timezone_bumper` function within a module:\n\n```julia\nmodule TimeZoneBumper\n\nusing Dates: DateTime, Date, TimeType, TimeZones\nimport Base: +\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::TimeType, bump::Int = 3)\n    if isa(dt, DateTime) || isa(dt, Date)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"timezone_bumper can only add hours to DateTime, not $(typeof(dt))\"))\n    end\n\n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Overload the plus operator for convenience\n+(dt::TimeType, bump::Int) = timezone_bumper(dt, bump)\n\nend  # module TimeZoneBumper\n```\n\nNow you can use this function with both `DateTime` and `Date`:\n\n```julia\nusing TimeZoneBumper\n\n# DateTime example\nnow = DateTime(2023, 1, 15, 12, 30)\nnew_dt = now + 2  # This line will add 2 hours to the timestamp of `now`\nprintln(new_dt)\n\n# Date example (will throw an error as expected)\nold_date = Date(2023, 1, 15)\nnew_date = old_date + 4  # This line will throw an ArgumentError\n```\n\nThe `+` operator is overloaded for convenience, so you can add hours to a date/time object directly without calling the function explicitly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,452],"elapsed":12.497144862,"_type":"aimessage"}]
