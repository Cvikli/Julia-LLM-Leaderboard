It then increases the timestamp of the `DateTime` by the specified number of hours (`bump` defaults to 3 hours) using the `timestamp()` and `Dates.Hour()` functions from the Julia Dates module. The time zone information is preserved by using `tzoneinfo(dt)`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,178],"elapsed":4.716955968,"_type":"aimessage"}]
