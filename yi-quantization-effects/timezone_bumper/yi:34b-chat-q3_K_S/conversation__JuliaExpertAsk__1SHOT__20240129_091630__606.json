The `signbit` function is used to determine whether the `bump` is positive or negative, so we can add 3 seconds if `bump` is positive (to avoid date wrapping around the end of a day) and adjust accordingly for negative `bump` values.","status":200,"tokens":[114,261],"elapsed":11.446688815,"_type":"aimessage"}]
