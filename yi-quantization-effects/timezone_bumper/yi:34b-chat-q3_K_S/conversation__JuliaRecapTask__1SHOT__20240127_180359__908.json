[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

It defaults to bumping by 3 hours if no value is provided for `bump`.\n- The internal logic uses the `timestamp` representation from the `Dates` module, which is a floating-point number representing the number of seconds since the start of the Unix epoch (1970-01-01) in UTC, with a millisecond precision.\n- We extract the time part of the timestamp by dividing the whole number by 1000 and then adding back the desired bump in hours, which we convert to seconds.\n- Finally, we reconstruct a new `DateTime` object using the original Unix timestamp seconds plus the bumped value with millisecond precision, ensuring that it is still in UTC timezone.\n- The function throws an error if the `bump` argument is not non-negative, as per the task requirement.\n- This function does not modify dates; it only adjusts the time component of the timestamp.\n- The return type is always a `DateTime` object to maintain consistency with the input types.","status":200,"tokens":[0,416],"elapsed":11.230911145,"_type":"aimessage"}]
