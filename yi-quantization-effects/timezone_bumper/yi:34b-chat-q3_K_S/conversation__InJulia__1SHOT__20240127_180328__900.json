Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, we can define a custom function `timezone_bumper` to increase the specified time zone by a given number of hours. The function should accept two arguments: `dt` which is a DateTime or Date type, and `bump` which is an integer specifying the number of hours to bump the time zone. If `bump` is not provided, it should default to adding 3 hours.\n\nHere's how we can define the function with appropriate error checking:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    # Convert DateTime to Date and Time of day components\n    date, time_of_day = split_datetime(dt)\n    \n    # If Date provided, return original date with updated time zone\n    if isa(date, Date)\n        return date + TimeZones.LocalTime(time_of_day + Hour(bump))\n    end\n    \n    # Bump the time zone by bump hours\n    new_local_time = time_of_day + Hour(bump)\n    \n    # Convert Date and Time of day back to DateTime\n    return date + new_local_time\nend\n\nfunction split_datetime(dt::DateTime)\n    date, time_of_day = TimeZones.DatePart(dt), TimeZones.TimePart(dt)\n    return date + Year(0), time_of_day\nend\n```\n\nThis function first splits the DateTime into its Date and Time of day components using `split_datetime` helper function. Then it bumps the Time of day by `bump` hours and combines it with the original Date to create a new DateTime. If `dt` is already a Date, it just adds the `Hour(bump)` to the LocalTime part before converting back to DateTime.\n\nPlease note that this function uses the `TimeZones` package for its functionality, so you need to add the following line at the beginning of your Julia session to use this function:\n\n```julia\nusing TimeZones\n```\n\nAlso, ensure that you are using a Julia version that supports time zones, which was introduced in Julia 1.5.0.","status":200,"tokens":[0,485],"elapsed":12.895822036,"_type":"aimessage"}]
