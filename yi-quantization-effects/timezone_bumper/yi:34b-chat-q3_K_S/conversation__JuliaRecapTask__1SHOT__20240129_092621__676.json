[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Integer=3)\n    if isa(dt, Date)\n        error(\"Cannot bump date without a time component\")\n    end\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The function first checks if the provided `dt` is of type `Date`. If so, it throws an error because Date does not have a time component and thus cannot be bumped with hours.\n- If `dt` is of type `DateTime`, which has both date and time information, the function returns a new DateTime object by adding `bump` hours to the original timestamp using `Hour(bump)` constructor for `Dates.Period` type. The default value for `bump` is set to 3 hours, but any integer provided by the user can be accepted as the bump value.\n- If no explicit error handling is necessary, Julia's built-in mechanism for type errors will automatically raise an error if the user tries to pass a non-DateTime type.","status":200,"tokens":[386,236],"elapsed":10.911435164,"_type":"aimessage"}]
