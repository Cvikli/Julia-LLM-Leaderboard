It returns a new `DateTime` with the original date plus the time zone offset applied. If no time zone offset is provided, it adds the default bump of 3 hours. The function ensures that the input type is `DateTime` and throws an error if someone tries to increase just the date without specifying a Time type.","status":200,"tokens":[0,183],"elapsed":4.85296418,"_type":"aimessage"}]
