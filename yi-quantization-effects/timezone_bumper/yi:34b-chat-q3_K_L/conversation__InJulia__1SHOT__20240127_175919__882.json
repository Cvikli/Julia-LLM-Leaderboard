Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can define the `timezone_bumper` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    if isa(dt, DateTime)\n        return DateTime(dt.year, dt.month, dt.day, dt.hour + bump, dt.minute, dt.second, dt.millisecond, dt.utc_offset)\n    elseif isa(dt, Date)\n        throw(ErrorException(\"timezone_bumper only works with DateTime types\"))\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a `DateTime` object and an integer `bump` as arguments. By default, it bumps the time by 3 hours. If you pass in a `Date` type, the function will throw an error.\n\nTo use this function, simply call it with your `DateTime` object:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\ndt = DateTime(2021, 5, 17, 14, 30)  # Example timestamp\nbump = 2  # Bump the time by 2 hours\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, bump)\n```\n\nThis will set `new_dt` to a new `DateTime` object that is two hours later than the original `dt`.\n\nRemember that if you want to work with TimeZones in Julia, you should install the `TimeZones` package and use it accordingly. The above function works with UTC offsets but does not account for time zones with daylight savings or other complexities. For more sophisticated time zone handling, I would recommend using the `TimeZones` package.","status":200,"tokens":[0,373],"elapsed":10.26739144,"_type":"aimessage"}]
