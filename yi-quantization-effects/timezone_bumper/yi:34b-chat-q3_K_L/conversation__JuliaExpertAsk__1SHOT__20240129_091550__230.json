If `bump` is not provided, it defaults to adding 3 hours. The function checks if the input is a `Date` type and throws an error if so, as it only operates on `DateTime` types. It then creates a new `DateTime` object with the updated hour value by adding `bump` hours to the original timestamp.","status":200,"tokens":[0,213],"elapsed":6.010687723,"_type":"aimessage"}]
