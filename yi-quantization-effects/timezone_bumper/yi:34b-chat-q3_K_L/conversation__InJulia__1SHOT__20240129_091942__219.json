Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function in Julia that bumps a given `DateTime` by a certain number of hours. If no `bump` is provided, it defaults to adding 3 hours:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    if isnan(dt.timezoneoffset) || dt.timezoneoffset == 0\n        # If the DateTime has no timezone offset or it's UTC, just add the hours\n        return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\n    else\n        # Otherwise, adjust for local timezone\n        return Dates.UTC(dt.year, dt.month, dt.day, dt.hour + bump, dt.minute, dt.second, dt.millisecond)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the `DateTime` has a non-zero timezone offset (indicating it's not in UTC). If it is in UTC, it simply adds the specified number of hours to the timestamp. If it's not in UTC, it adjusts the time to UTC and then adds the hours, so that the resulting timestamp will be in UTC with the adjusted hour value.\n\nTo ensure this function only works with `DateTime` types and throws an error for `Date` types, you can define a method overload for `timezone_bumper` that works on `Date` types and has a different behavior:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int = 3)\n    throw(DomainError(\"Cannot modify date without a timestamp. Provide a DateTime type to adjust the time component.\"))\nend\n```\n\nBy doing this, when you call `timezone_bumper` with a `Date` type, it will trigger the method defined for `Date` and throw an error, telling you that you need to provide a `DateTime` to adjust the time component.\n\nRemember to always handle edge cases and ensure that your functions are safe to use with different types of inputs.","status":200,"tokens":[75,446],"elapsed":17.580933533,"_type":"aimessage"}]
