If `bump` is not provided, it defaults to 3 hours. The function ensures that the new DateTime object returned has the same time zone as the original one.\n\nThe `timezone_bumper` function throws an `ArgumentError` if `bump` is NaN or negative. It works only with `DateTime` types and does not accept `Date` types; attempting to pass a `Date` will result in a type error at runtime.","status":200,"tokens":[0,224],"elapsed":6.143420562,"_type":"aimessage"}]
