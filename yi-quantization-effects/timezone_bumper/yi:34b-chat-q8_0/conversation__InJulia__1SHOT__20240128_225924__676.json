It adds the specified number of hours to the timestamp. The function also includes a test to assert that the bumped time is correct for the default value of `bump`, and it throws an error when trying to add hours to a `Date` object without a time component.\n\nRemember to import the `Dates` module at the beginning so that you can use the `DateTime` and `Date` types as well as the `Hour` construct from the `Dates` standard library.","status":200,"tokens":[0,392],"elapsed":17.601887648,"_type":"aimessage"}]
