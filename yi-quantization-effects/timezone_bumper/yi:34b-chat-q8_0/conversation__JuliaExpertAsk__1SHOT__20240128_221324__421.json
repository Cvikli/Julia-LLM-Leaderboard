It then calculates the new timestamp by adding `bump` hours to the current time part of the `DateTime` using `Dates.localtime(dt)`, which returns a `TimeType` with the local time corresponding to the date in `dt`. The `+ Dates.Hour(bump)` operation adds the specified number of hours to this time.\n\nFinally, it constructs a new `DateTime` object with the same year, month, and day as the original `dt` but with the bumped time zone information. The `utc=true` parameter in the `Dates.DateTime` constructor ensures that the resulting timestamp is in UTC.","status":200,"tokens":[0,355],"elapsed":15.963266432,"_type":"aimessage"}]
