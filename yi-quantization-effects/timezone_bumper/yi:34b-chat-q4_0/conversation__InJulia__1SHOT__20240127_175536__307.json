Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Integer = 3)\n    if typeof(dt) == Date\n        throw(DomainError(\"Cannot increase a Date type by hours, use DateTime instead.\"))\n    end\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nThis function `timezone_bumper` takes two arguments:\n- `dt`: A `DateTime` object representing the timestamp to be bumped.\n- `bump`: An integer representing the number of hours by which to increase `dt`. The default value is 3 hours if no explicit argument is given.\n\nThe function first checks if `dt` is a `Date` type. If so, it throws a `DomainError` with an appropriate message indicating that `Date` types cannot be increased by hours and that a `DateTime` should be used instead.\n\nIf `dt` is a valid `DateTime` type, the function returns `dt + Hour(bump)`, where `Hour(bump)` creates a `Dates.Hour` object representing the number of hours to add to the timestamp.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes you are working with UTC times and does not account for daylight saving time (DST) or local time zones. If you need to handle DST or time zone conversions, you should use appropriate functions from the `Dates` or `TimeZones` packages in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[0,312],"elapsed":8.228809861,"_type":"aimessage"}]
