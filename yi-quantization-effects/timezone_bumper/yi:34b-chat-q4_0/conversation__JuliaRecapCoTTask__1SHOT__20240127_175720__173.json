[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

If `bump` is outside the range of -12 to +12 hours, an `ArgumentError` is thrown. The function then returns a new `DateTime` with the specified time zone offset applied.\n\nThe default value for `bump` is set to 3 hours. This ensures that if no `bump` is provided, the time will still be adjusted by 3 hours.\n\nFor safety and clarity, the function also checks if the input is a `Date` type and throws an error if so, as dates do not have a time zone offset and cannot be bumped in this manner.\n\nThe use of `Integer` as the type for `bump` allows for flexibility in case future versions of Julia extend the range of possible time zone offsets.","status":200,"tokens":[11,337],"elapsed":9.078064401,"_type":"aimessage"}]
