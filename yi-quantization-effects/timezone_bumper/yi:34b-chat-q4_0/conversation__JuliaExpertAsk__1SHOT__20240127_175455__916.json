If `bump` is not provided, it defaults to adding 3 hours. The function checks that `bump` is between -24 and 24 hours to ensure valid timezone adjustments. It then creates a new `DateTime` object with the adjusted hour value and the same date information as the original timestamp. The `utcoffset()` method is used to preserve the original time zone offset.\n\nThe function will throw an `ArgumentError` if an invalid `bump` is provided, and it will also throw an error if a `Date` type is passed instead of a `DateTime` type.","status":200,"tokens":[0,275],"elapsed":7.264783053,"_type":"aimessage"}]
