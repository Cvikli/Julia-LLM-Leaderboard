If the input is a `DateTime`, it is first converted to a `TimeZonedDateTime` with UTC time zone if no time zone information is provided. Then, the time zone offset is increased by the specified number of hours, and a new `DateTime` is constructed from the resulting instant adjusted to the new offset.\n\nThe second part of the function definition is a placeholder that would error when attempting to increase a `Date` type by hours, as it does not make sense to add time zone offsets to a date without a time component. The `DomainError` ensures that an informative error message is thrown when an invalid input is provided.","status":200,"tokens":[72,389],"elapsed":11.163434802,"_type":"aimessage"}]
