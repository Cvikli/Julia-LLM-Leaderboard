If `bump` is not provided, it defaults to 3 hours. The function converts the `DateTime` to a `Time` type without changing its date part. It then adds the specified number of hours to the `Time` object using `Duration` from the `Unitful` package (which provides support for units in Julia). Finally, it reconstructs the new `DateTime` by combining the updated time with the original date part of the input `DateTime`.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes you are working with a time zone that does not observe daylight saving time or other complex time zone rules. If your time zone does observe these changes, you should consider using a more sophisticated approach that accounts for those variations.","status":200,"tokens":[0,299],"elapsed":8.652287505,"_type":"aimessage"}]
