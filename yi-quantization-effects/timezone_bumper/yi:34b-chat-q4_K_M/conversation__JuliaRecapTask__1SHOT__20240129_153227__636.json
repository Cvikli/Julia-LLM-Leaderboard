[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Integer=3)\n    if !(typeof(dt) <: DateTime)\n        error(\"Input must be a DateTime type.\")\n    end\n    return DateTime(unix2datetime(unix2num(dt) + (bump * 60 * 60)), dateformat=\"yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM:SS\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input `dt` is of type `DateTime`. If not, it throws an error. It then uses the `unix2datetime` and `unix2num` functions from the `Dates` standard library to convert the DateTime to a Unix timestamp (seconds since 1970-01-01), adds the specified number of hours to this timestamp, and finally converts back to a DateTime using the provided format string.\n\nThe `dateformat` argument in the `DateTime` constructor is used to ensure that the resulting DateTime is formatted as a standard ISO 8601 date-time string with time zone information (UTC). This format is YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS, where \"T\" separates the date from the time, and \"HH:MM:SS\" represents the time in hours, minutes, and seconds.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes a fixed time zone of UTC for both input and output timestamps. If you need to work with different time zones, you would need to include additional logic to handle time zone conversions.","status":200,"tokens":[0,343],"elapsed":10.068788451,"_type":"aimessage"}]
