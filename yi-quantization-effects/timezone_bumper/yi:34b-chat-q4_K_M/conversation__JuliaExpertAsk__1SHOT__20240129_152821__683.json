If `bump` is not provided, it defaults to adding 3 hours. The function checks that the input `dt` is indeed a `DateTime` type, and then calculates a new `DateTime` by adding the specified number of hours to the UTC timestamp of the original `DateTime`. Finally, it returns the new `DateTime` object.","status":200,"tokens":[0,225],"elapsed":6.487204553,"_type":"aimessage"}]
