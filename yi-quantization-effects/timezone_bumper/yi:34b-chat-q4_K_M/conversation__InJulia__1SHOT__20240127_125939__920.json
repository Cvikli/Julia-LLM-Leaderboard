If so, it throws an error because the function is intended only for `DateTime` types. It then converts the `DateTime` to a Unix timestamp (nanoseconds since unix epoch) and adds `bump` hours to that timestamp by multiplying `bump` with the number of nanoseconds in an hour (3600 seconds * 10^9 nanoseconds per second). Finally, it converts the new timestamp back to a `DateTime` object and returns it. The default value for `bump` is set to 3 hours, but you can change this or pass any other integer as an argument when calling the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,318],"elapsed":8.984724565,"_type":"aimessage"}]
