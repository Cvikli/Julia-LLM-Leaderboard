Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can define the `timezone_bumper` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    # Convert DateTime to TimeArray to work with hours\n    time_array = TimeArray(dt)\n    \n    # Bump the time by the specified number of hours\n    new_time_array = time_array + (bump * Hour(1))\n    \n    # Convert back to DateTime and return\n    return DateTime(new_time_array)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a `DateTime` object `dt` and an integer `bump` representing the number of hours to add. If `bump` is not provided, it defaults to adding 3 hours. It converts the `DateTime` to a `TimeArray`, which allows for easier manipulation of time components. The function then bumps the time by the specified number of hours and converts back to a `DateTime` before returning.\n\nTo ensure that the function works only with `DateTime` types and throws an error for `Date` types, you can define it within a `try-catch` block:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Union{DateTime, Date}, bump::Int = 3)\n    # Attempt to convert the date/time object to DateTime\n    try\n        dt = DateTime(dt)\n    catch e\n        if isa(e, MethodError) && occursin(\"DateTime\", string(e))\n            error(\"Input must be a DateTime, not a Date.\")\n        else\n            rethrow()\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Rest of the function code here...\nend\n```\n\nThe `try-catch` block attempts to convert the provided date/time object to a `DateTime`. If it's not possible, a `MethodError` will be thrown if `DateTime(dt)` is called on something that's not a `DateTime` or a `Date` (like an integer). The error message checks for the presence of \"DateTime\" in the string representation of the error to ensure it's due to trying to convert a `Date` to a `DateTime` and not some other type of error. If the conversion is successful, the rest of the function code will execute.\n\nPlease note that this function does not account for daylight saving time (DST) changes or any other complexities related to time zones. It simply adds the specified number of hours to the timestamp without considering the local time zone or DST transitions.","status":200,"tokens":[0,563],"elapsed":16.388244345,"_type":"aimessage"}]
