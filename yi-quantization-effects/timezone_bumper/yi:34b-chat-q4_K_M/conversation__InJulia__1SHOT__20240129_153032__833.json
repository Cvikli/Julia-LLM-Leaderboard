Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can define a function `timezone_bumper` that takes two arguments: a `DateTime` object `dt` and an integer `bump` representing the number of hours to increase the timestamp by. If `bump` is not provided, it defaults to adding 3 hours. The function should also ensure that it only works with `DateTime` types and throws an error if a `Date` type is passed.\n\nHere's how you can define such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    # Check if dt is of type DateTime\n    if typeof(dt) != DateTime\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be of type DateTime.\"))\n    end\n\n    # Adjust the time by bump hours\n    new_time = LocalTime(dt) + Duration(bump, Unitful.Hour)\n\n    # Convert back to DateTime and return\n    return DateTime(new_time; zone=timezone(dt))\nend\n\n# Test the function\nusing Dates: Date, TimeZones\nnow = DateTime(2023, 1, 1, 12, 30)  # An example timestamp\nprintln(\"Original time: \", now)\nprintln(\"Time increased by 5 hours: \", timezone_bumper(now, 5))\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input `dt` is of type `DateTime`. If not, an `ArgumentError` is thrown. It then adjusts the time of the `DateTime` object using the `LocalTime` constructor and adds the specified number of hours to it. Finally, it converts the adjusted time back to a `DateTime` object with the same time zone as the original and returns the result.\n\nIf you try to pass a `Date` type to this function, an error will be thrown because the `LocalTime` constructor requires both a date and a time component.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the local timezone is used for the adjustment. If you need to work with different timezones, you should provide the appropriate time zone information in the `DateTime` construction.","status":200,"tokens":[0,481],"elapsed":13.938998374,"_type":"aimessage"}]
