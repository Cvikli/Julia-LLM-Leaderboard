By default, it adds 3 hours. The function checks that the input is indeed a `DateTime` type and throws an `ArgumentError` if not. It then calculates the new time by adding the specified number of hours to the timestamp using `Duration` from the `Unitful` package (which provides support for units in Julia). Finally, it returns the updated `DateTime` object.","status":200,"tokens":[0,232],"elapsed":6.70430256,"_type":"aimessage"}]
