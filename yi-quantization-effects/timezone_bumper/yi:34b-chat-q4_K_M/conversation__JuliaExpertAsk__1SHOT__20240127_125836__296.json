If no value is provided for `bump`, it defaults to adding 3 hours. The function ensures that the input is a `DateTime` by checking if it's an instance of `Date` using the `isa` operator and throws an `ArgumentError` if so. It then constructs a new `DateTime` object with the updated hour value, keeping the other components (minute, second, etc.) unchanged.","status":200,"tokens":[0,224],"elapsed":6.325634628,"_type":"aimessage"}]
