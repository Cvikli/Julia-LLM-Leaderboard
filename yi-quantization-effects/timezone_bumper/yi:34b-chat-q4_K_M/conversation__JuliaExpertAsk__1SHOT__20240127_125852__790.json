If `bump` is not provided, it defaults to adding 3 hours. The function checks if the input `dt` is a `DateTime` type, and if not, it throws an `ArgumentError`. It then calculates a new UTC offset by adding `bump` hours to the current UTC offset of the `DateTime` object. Finally, it creates a new `DateTime` with the adjusted timezone offset and returns it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,286],"elapsed":8.087524284,"_type":"aimessage"}]
