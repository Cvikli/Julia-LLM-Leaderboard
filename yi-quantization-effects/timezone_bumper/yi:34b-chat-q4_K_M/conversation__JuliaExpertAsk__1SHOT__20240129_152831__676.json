If `bump` is not provided, it defaults to 3 hours. The function checks if `dt` is a `Date` type and throws an error if so, as Date types do not have a time component and cannot be adjusted by hours.\n\nIf `dt` is a valid `DateTime`, the function calculates the new time by adding `bump` to the hour component of `dt`. It then creates a new `DateTime` object with the updated hour, preserving the year, month, day, minute, second, and millisecond components from the original `DateTime`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,332],"elapsed":9.590231431,"_type":"aimessage"}]
