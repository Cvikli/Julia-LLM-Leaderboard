[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    if !(typeof(dt) <: DateTime)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be a DateTime type\"))\n    end\n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nThis function checks if the input `dt` is of type `DateTime` and then simply adds `Dates.Hour(bump)` to it, where `bump` is an integer representing the number of hours to bump by (defaulting to 3 hours). If no `bump` is provided, it bumps by 3 hours.\n\nTo test this function, you can use the following code:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\ndt = DateTime(2023, 1, 1, 12, 0, 0)  # An example timestamp\nbump = 5  # Bump by 5 hours\n\nresult = timezone_bumper(dt, bump)\nprintln(\"Original date/time: $dt\")\nprintln(\"Bumped date/time:   $result\")\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nOriginal date/time: 2023-01-01T12:00:00\nBumped date/time:   2023-01-01T17:00:00\n```\n\nNote that the `Dates` module is imported for using functions like `DateTime` and `Hour`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,350],"elapsed":10.26828229,"_type":"aimessage"}]
