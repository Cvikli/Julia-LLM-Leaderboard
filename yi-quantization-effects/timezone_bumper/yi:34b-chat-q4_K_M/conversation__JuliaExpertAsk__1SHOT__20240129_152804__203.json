If no value is provided for `bump`, it defaults to adding 3 hours. The function works by first converting the `DateTime` to a `Time` type so that the time zone offset can be adjusted. It then adds the specified number of hours to the `Time` object using a `Duration` with units of hours from Unitful. Finally, it converts the adjusted time back to a `DateTime` and returns it.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the provided `DateTime` is in UTC or has a known offset that can be represented as an integer number of hours. If the `DateTime` contains a non-standard time zone or a time zone with a fractional offset, the result may not be accurate.","status":200,"tokens":[0,284],"elapsed":8.196141012,"_type":"aimessage"}]
