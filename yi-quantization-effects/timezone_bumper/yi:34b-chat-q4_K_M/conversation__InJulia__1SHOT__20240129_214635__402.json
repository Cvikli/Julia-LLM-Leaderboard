Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    # Convert the DateTime to a Time type to adjust the time zone offset\n    time = Time(dt)\n    \n    # Adjust the time by the specified number of hours\n    new_time = time + Duration(bump, Unitful.Hour)\n    \n    # Reconstruct the DateTime with the adjusted time\n    return DateTime(new_time)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a `DateTime` object `dt` and adjusts it by `bump` hours (defaulting to 3 hours if not specified). It converts the `DateTime` to a `Time` type so that it's easier to adjust the time zone offset, adds the desired duration in hours, and then reconstructs the new `DateTime` with the adjusted time.\n\nTo ensure that this function only works with `DateTime` types and not `Date` types, you can add a check like this:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Union{DateTime, Date}, bump::Int=3)\n    if isa(dt, DateTime)\n        # Adjust the DateTime as before\n        return DateTime(Time(dt) + Duration(bump, Unitful.Hour))\n    else\n        error(\"timezone_bumper can only be applied to DateTime types, not Date types.\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis updated function checks if the input `dt` is a `DateTime` and applies the adjustment as before. If the type is not `DateTime`, it errors out with a message indicating that the function can only be applied to `DateTime` types.","status":200,"tokens":[0,371],"elapsed":10.754142886,"_type":"aimessage"}]
