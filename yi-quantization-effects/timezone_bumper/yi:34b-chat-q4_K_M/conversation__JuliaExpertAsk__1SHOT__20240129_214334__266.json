If no `bump` is provided, it defaults to adding 3 hours. The function checks that the input is indeed a `DateTime` type and then calculates the new time by adding the specified number of hours to the timestamp part of the `DateTime`. Finally, it returns the updated `DateTime` with the original timezone information preserved.","status":200,"tokens":[102,228],"elapsed":6.749188382,"_type":"aimessage"}]
