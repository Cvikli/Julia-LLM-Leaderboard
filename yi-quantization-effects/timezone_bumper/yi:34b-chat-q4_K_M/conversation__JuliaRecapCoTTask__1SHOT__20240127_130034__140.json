[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"If no special instructions are provided, I will proceed with the following solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    if isnan(bump) || bump == 0\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"`bump` must be a non-zero integer\"))\n    end\n\n    # Convert DateTime to TimeType (without the date part)\n    time_part = Time(dt)\n\n    # Add the specified number of hours to the time part\n    new_time_part = time_part + Duration(bump, Hours)\n\n    # Reconstruct a new DateTime from the updated time part and original date part\n    return DateTime(date(dt), new_time_part)\nend\n```\n\nThis function ensures that `bump` is a non-zero integer. It then converts the `DateTime` to its corresponding `TimeType` representation (which discards the date information). The specified number of hours is added to this time using a `Duration`, and finally, a new `DateTime` is constructed from the original date part and the updated time part.\n\nPlease note that if you are provided with specific instructions or requirements, they should take precedence over the general approach outlined above. If no special instructions are given, the function above should cover the basic task of adding hours to a `DateTime` value.","status":200,"tokens":[0,304],"elapsed":8.72381992,"_type":"aimessage"}]
