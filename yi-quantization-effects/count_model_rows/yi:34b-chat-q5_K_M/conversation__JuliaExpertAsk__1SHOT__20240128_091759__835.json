The `eachrow` iterator is used to iterate over each row of the grouped data, and `length(row)` is assumed to give you the number of rows in that group (if your DataFrame has other columns besides `model`). The result is a dictionary where each model is mapped to its corresponding count.","status":200,"tokens":[0,206],"elapsed":6.685036011,"_type":"aimessage"}]
