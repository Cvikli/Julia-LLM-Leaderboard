Then, it uses a dictionary to count the number of rows for each model. For each group, it checks if the model is already present in the dictionary and increments the count accordingly.\n\nTo use this function with your DataFrame `df_cars`, you would simply call:\n\n```julia\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThis will return a dictionary where the keys are the unique model values and the values are the counts of how many rows there are for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,331],"elapsed":10.75253268,"_type":"aimessage"}]
