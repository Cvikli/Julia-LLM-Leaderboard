Below is an example of how to define such a function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n    counts = Dict()\n    for model in unique(df_cars.model)\n        if !ismissing(model) # If the model value is not missing\n            local_count = length(filter(!ismissing, grouped[model])) # Count only non-missing values\n            counts[model] = local_count\n        end\n    end\n    return counts\nend\n\n# Example usage with a hypothetical `df_cars` DataFrame\n# Assuming df_cars has a 'model' column\ndf_models_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThis function first groups the data by the `:model` column using `groupby`. It then iterates over the unique models in the grouped DataFrame and counts the number of rows for each model that are not missing (using `filter` to filter out missing values before counting with `length`). Finally, it returns a dictionary where the keys are the distinct model names and the values are the corresponding row counts.\n\nMake sure to include the following at the beginning of your Julia session:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n```\n\nThis will import the `DataFrames` package, which provides high-level data manipulation tools similar to Pandas in Python or dplyr in R. The `DataFrame` type is defined within this package and used for tabular data.","status":200,"tokens":[0,403],"elapsed":13.113773091,"_type":"aimessage"}]
