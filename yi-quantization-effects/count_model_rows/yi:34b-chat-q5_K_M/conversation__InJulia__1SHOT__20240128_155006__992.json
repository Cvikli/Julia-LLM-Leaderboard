Here's an example of how to define such a function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return combine(groupby(df, :model), nrow = length)\nend\n\n# Example usage with a hypothetical df_cars DataFrame\ndf_cars = # Your actual data frame here\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nIn this function:\n\n- `groupby(df, :model)` groups the data by the `model` column.\n- `combine(grouped_data, nrow = length)` applies the `length` function to each group to get the number of rows for each model. The `combine` function is used to combine the grouped data after applying a function to each group.\n\nMake sure to replace `# Your actual data frame here` with your actual `DataFrame` named `df_cars` that contains the `model` column.\n\nIf you're using Julia v1.6 or higher, you can simplify the function using the new compact syntax for `combine`:\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return combine(groupby(df, :model)) do grp\n        length(grp)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis version is more concise and directly applies the length function to each group without needing an explicit `nrow` key.","status":200,"tokens":[0,368],"elapsed":11.966858164,"_type":"aimessage"}]
