Below is an example of how to define such a function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame, col::Symbol)\n    grouped = groupby(df, col)\n    counts = combine(grouped, : => length)\n    return counts\nend\n\n# Example usage with a hypothetical `df_cars`\n# Assuming df_cars contains a column \"model\"\ndf_models = count_model_rows(df_cars, :model)\n```\n\nThis function takes in a `DataFrame` and a symbol representing the column to group by. It then groups the data by that column using `groupby` and applies `combine` to reduce each group to a single row by counting the number of rows in each group. The result is a new `DataFrame` where each group from the original `DataFrame` is represented as a row, with the count of how many rows were in that group.\n\nIf you want to also include the model name in the output DataFrame, you can modify the function like this:\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame, col::Symbol)\n    grouped = groupby(df, col)\n    counts = combine(grouped, : => length)\n    return vcat(NamedTuple{(col,)} -> (; NamedTuple()), counts)\nend\n```\n\nThis will add a column to the output DataFrame with the model names from the original `DataFrame`. The `vcat` function is used to concatenate the model names and the count results.","status":200,"tokens":[0,404],"elapsed":13.144679359,"_type":"aimessage"}]
