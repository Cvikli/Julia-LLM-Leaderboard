It then applies the `|>` operator (forward pipe) to chain the `g -> count(ismissing(g[1].model))` part, which takes each grouped DataFrame and counts the number of rows where `model` is not missing. Finally, it returns a vector with the row counts for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,179],"elapsed":5.813367505,"_type":"aimessage"}]
