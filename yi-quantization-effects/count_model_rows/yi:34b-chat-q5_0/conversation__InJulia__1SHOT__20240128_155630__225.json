Below is an example of how you could write the `count_model_rows` function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = combine(grouped, : => length)\n    return counts\nend\n\n# Example usage with a hypothetical df_cars\ndf_cars = ... # Your data frame with a 'model' column\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThe `groupby` function returns a grouped DataFrame, where each group is a series of rows that share the same value in the specified column(s). In this case, we are grouping by the `:model` column. Then, we use the `combine` function to apply a function to each group and combine the results into a new DataFrame. The anonymous function `: => length` applies the `length` function to each group, which counts the number of rows in that group.\n\nMake sure to import the `DataFrames` package at the beginning if you haven't already and replace `df_cars = ...` with your actual DataFrame. The result will be a new DataFrame where each row represents a unique model and the count of its occurrences in the original DataFrame.\n\nIf you want to print or further manipulate the results, you can do so after calling the function:\n\n```julia\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(\"Model\\tCount\")\nfor row in eachrow(counts)\n    println(\"$(row.model)\\t\\t$(row.count)\")\nend\n```\n\nThis will print out the unique models and their counts to the console.","status":200,"tokens":[58,433],"elapsed":13.907965721,"_type":"aimessage"}]
