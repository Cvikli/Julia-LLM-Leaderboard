Below is an example of how to write the `count_model_rows` function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    # Group the data by the 'model' column\n    grouped_data = groupby(df, :model)\n    \n    # Iterate over each group and count the number of rows\n    counts = Dict()\n    for model in unique(df.model)\n        rows = filter(row -> row.model == model, df)\n        counts[model] = length(rows)\n    end\n    \n    return counts\nend\n\n# Example usage with a hypothetical DataFrame `df_cars`\ndf_cars = # Your data goes here\nmodel_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThis function first groups the data by the `model` column using `groupby`. Then it iterates over each unique model in the grouped data and filters for rows where the `model` equals that specific model. Finally, it counts the number of rows for each model and stores them in a dictionary with the keys being the models and the values being the counts.\n\nPlease note that you need to replace `# Your data goes here` with your actual DataFrame `df_cars` containing the `model` column. If you have other columns in your DataFrame, make sure to filter by `model` correctly without affecting other columns.","status":200,"tokens":[0,355],"elapsed":11.25678159,"_type":"aimessage"}]
