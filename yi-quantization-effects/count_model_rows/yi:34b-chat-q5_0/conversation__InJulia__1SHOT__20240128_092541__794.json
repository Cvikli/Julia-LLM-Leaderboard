Below is an example of how to write a `count_model_rows` function that groups a `DataFrame` by the `model` column and calculates the count for each unique model.\n\nFirst, you need to install the `GroupBy` package if you haven't already:\n\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add([\"DataFrames\", \"GroupBy\"])\n```\n\nNow, you can write the following function:\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    # Group by model and calculate the size of each group (number of rows per model)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = mapreduce(eachrow(grouped), +, init=0) do row, _\n        return row.model === missing ? 0 : 1\n    end\n    # Convert the counts to a DataFrame with one column and one row per group\n    return DataFrame(count_models = counts)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first groups the `DataFrame` by the `model` column using `groupby`. Then, it uses `mapreduce` to iterate over each row in the grouped DataFrame, incrementing a counter for each unique model. Since `mapreduce` returns an integer (the sum of counts), we need to convert this back into a `DataFrame` with one column and one row per group.\n\nHere's how you can use the function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, GroupBy\n\n# Example DataFrame with a 'model' column\ndf_cars = ... # Your DataFrame here\n\ncounts_per_model = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(\"Number of rows per model:\")\ndisplay(counts_per_model)\n```\n\nReplace `...` with your actual `DataFrame` containing the `model` column. The function will return a new `DataFrame` with a single column named `count_models`, which contains the count for each unique model. If a model is missing, it will not be included in the output.","status":200,"tokens":[58,507],"elapsed":16.286624523,"_type":"aimessage"}]
