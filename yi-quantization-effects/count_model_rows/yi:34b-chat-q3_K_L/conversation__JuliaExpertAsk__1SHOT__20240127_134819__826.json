Then, it applies the `length` function to each group to get the number of rows for each model. Finally, it calls `unique` to return only unique counts, discarding any duplicate models that might have been counted more than once.","status":200,"tokens":[88,121],"elapsed":3.48210713,"_type":"aimessage"}]
