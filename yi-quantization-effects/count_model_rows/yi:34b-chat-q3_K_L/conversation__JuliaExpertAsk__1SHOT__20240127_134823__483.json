It uses the `groupby` function to group the data, followed by a chain operator (`|>`) to pipe the result into another function that takes the first element of the grouped data (using `first`) and extracts the size of the first group (using `size`), and finally returns the length of that group as the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,138],"elapsed":3.786331649,"_type":"aimessage"}]
