Here's how you can define the `count_model_rows` function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped_models = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = mapreduce(el -> length(el), +, grouped_models)\n    return counts\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ndf_cars = YourDataFrameSource() # Replace with your actual data source or an example DataFrame\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThe `groupby` function groups the rows of a DataFrame based on keys given by a function that maps each row to a key. In this case, we're mapping each row to its `model` value. The `mapreduce` function applies a function to each group and reduces it to a single value using a combine operation (in this case, addition).\n\nRemember to replace `YourDataFrameSource()` with your actual data source or provide an example DataFrame if you're testing the function. If you have an existing `df_cars` DataFrame, you can call the `count_model_rows` function directly with your DataFrame as an argument.\n\nMake sure to include the `using DataFrames` statement at the beginning of your script so that you have access to the `groupby` and `mapreduce` functions from the DataFrames package.","status":200,"tokens":[0,358],"elapsed":9.849614574,"_type":"aimessage"}]
