Here's an example of how you might write the `count_model_rows` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    models = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = map(models) do model_group\n        length(model_group)\n    end\n    return counts\nend\n\n# Example usage with a hypothetical `df_cars` DataFrame:\ndf_cars = ... # Your DataFrame here\nmodel_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(\"Number of rows for each model:\")\nfor (model, count) in enumerate(model_counts)\n    println(\"Model $(model): $count rows\")\nend\n```\n\nPlease note that the `df_cars` DataFrame is not provided in your example, so you would need to replace `... # Your DataFrame here` with the actual data from your dataset. The `groupby` function groups the data by the specified column (in this case, `:model`) and returns a GroupedDataFrame. Then, the `map` function is used to apply the `length` function to each group, which gives us the count of rows for each model.\n\nThe `enumerate` function is then used to iterate over the counts and print the model number and the corresponding row count.","status":200,"tokens":[58,345],"elapsed":9.641830973,"_type":"aimessage"}]
