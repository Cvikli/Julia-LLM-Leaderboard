Here's an example of how you can write the `count_model_rows` function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Statistics\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped_models = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = [length(x) for _, x in grouped_models]\n    return counts\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ndf_cars = # Your DataFrame with a 'model' column\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThe `groupby` function returns a GroupedDataFrameIterator where each element is a view of the source data frame with rows grouped by the given key. We then use an anonymous function to apply the `length` function to each group and return the resulting array of counts.\n\nMake sure to import the `DataFrames` and `Statistics` packages at the top if you haven't already done so in your script or REPL session. The `DataFrame` type is defined within the `DataFrames` package, and the `groupby` function that we use is part of the `Statistics` package (because it internally uses statistical grouping concepts).","status":200,"tokens":[0,300],"elapsed":7.939402287,"_type":"aimessage"}]
