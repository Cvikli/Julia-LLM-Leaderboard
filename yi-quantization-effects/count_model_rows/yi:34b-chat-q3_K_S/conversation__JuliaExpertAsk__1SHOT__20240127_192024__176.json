The inner function `g -> mapreduce(identity, +, g)` takes a grouped array `g` and reduces it using `mapreduce` with an initial value of 0 (the identity function `x -> x` is used to avoid currying). Finally, `[1]` selects the first element of the output vector, which is the total count for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,174],"elapsed":4.606351734,"_type":"aimessage"}]
