If you have a column named `model` in your data frame, the function will group the data by that column and return a new DataFrame containing the unique models and their corresponding row counts.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n# Assuming df_cars is already a DataFrame in your workspace\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThe `DataFrame` `counts` will now have two columns: one for the unique models and another with their respective row counts.","status":200,"tokens":[0,278],"elapsed":7.367666705,"_type":"aimessage"}]
