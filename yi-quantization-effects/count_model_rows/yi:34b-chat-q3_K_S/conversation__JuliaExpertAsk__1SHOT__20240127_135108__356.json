If you want to count the total number of models instead, remove the `|>` and end the function with `return size(df_cars)[1]` or `length(df_cars)` depending on whether you're using DataFrames or a collection that implements `Base.IteratorEltype` like an Array.","status":200,"tokens":[0,174],"elapsed":4.592036432,"_type":"aimessage"}]
