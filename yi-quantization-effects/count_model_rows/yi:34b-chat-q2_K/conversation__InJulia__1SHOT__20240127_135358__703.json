To group data by a specific column and count the number of rows for each unique value, you can use the `groupby` function provided by the StatsBase.jl package. Below is an example of how to write a custom function `count_model_rows` that counts the number of rows for each model in a DataFrame:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nusing Statistics: count\nusing StatsBase\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    by_model = groupby(df_cars, :model) # Group data by `model` column\n    counts = map(by_model) do group\n        # Calculate the number of rows for each `model`\n        length(group.data)\n    end\n    return counts\nend\n\n# Example usage:\n# Assume df_cars is a DataFrame with a 'model' column\ndf_models_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThe `count_model_rows` function returns a vector containing the number of rows for each unique model.\n\nPlease note that if you are using Julia 1.6 or later, the `DataFrames` package has been updated to use the modern groupby and reduce interfaces from StatsBase, so you might not need to call `map` explicitly as shown above. Instead, you can write:\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    counts = groupby(df_cars, :model) |>\n        reduce(DataFrame, _ -> DataFrameRow(_))  # Convert each group to a row\n    return counts\nend\n```\n\nThis will return the same result as before, but it uses the `reduce` function under the hood to combine the intermediate results into a single DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,415],"elapsed":10.639697542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
