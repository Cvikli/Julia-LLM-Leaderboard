Below is the definition of the `count_model_rows` function you can use in Julia to count the number of rows per group in a DataFrame based on a specific column (`model` in this case). This function returns a Series object containing the counts for each unique model.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics: count\nusing Base64EncodePipe\nimport Pkg; Pkg.status(\"DataFrames\") # Make sure you have DataFrames installed\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame, column::Symbol)\n    grouped_counts = by(df, :=>count)(column)\n    return grouped_counts[!, :value]\nend\n```\n\nTo use this function with your `df_cars` DataFrame, you would write the following:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n# Assuming df_cars is a DataFrame with a 'model' column\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars, :model)\n```\n\nThis will create a Series object containing the counts for each unique `model` in your `df_cars` DataFrame.\n\nPlease note that you need to have the `DataFrames.jl` package installed to use this function. You can install it by running:\n\n```julia\nusing Pkg; Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\")\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `import Pkg; Pkg.status(\"DataFrames\")` with `Pkg.checkout(\"DataFrames\")` if you want to update an existing DataFrames package or install it in the current environment.","status":200,"tokens":[0,358],"elapsed":9.161232875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
