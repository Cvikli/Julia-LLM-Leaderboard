The `|>` operator is used to chain operations, and `collect` converts the grouped data into a vector of tuples, where each tuple contains a model and its corresponding count. Finally, `length .> 0` selects only those models that have a non-zero row count.","status":200,"tokens":[0,138],"elapsed":10.688635903,"_type":"aimessage"}]
