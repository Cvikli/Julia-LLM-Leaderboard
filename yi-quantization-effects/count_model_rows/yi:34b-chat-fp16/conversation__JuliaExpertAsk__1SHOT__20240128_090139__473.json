It then iterates over the unique models in the data and counts the number of rows for each model using `length`. Finally, it returns a dictionary where the keys are the models and the values are the corresponding row counts.","status":200,"tokens":[88,181],"elapsed":14.031307518,"_type":"aimessage"}]
