The `eachrow(grouped)` iterator yields one row at a time from the grouped data, and `+` is used as an accumulator to sum up the counts. The initial value of the accumulator is set to 0. Finally, the result is returned as a vector of counts corresponding to each unique model in the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,180],"elapsed":13.939838934,"_type":"aimessage"}]
