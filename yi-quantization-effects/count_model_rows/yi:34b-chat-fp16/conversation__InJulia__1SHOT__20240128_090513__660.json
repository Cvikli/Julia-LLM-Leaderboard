The function `count_model_rows` expects a `DataFrame` as input and returns a dictionary where the keys are unique models and the values are the counts of how many rows each model has in the DataFrame.\n\nIf you already have the `unique(df.model)`, you can improve the performance by pre-calculating the unique models before iterating over them:\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    # Get unique models\n    models = unique(df.model)\n    \n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store counts\n    counts = Dict()\n    \n    # Iterate over each unique model and calculate the count\n    for model in models\n        row_count = size(filter(x -> x[:model] == model, df)[1], 1)\n        counts[model] = row_count\n    end\n    \n    return counts\nend\n```\n\nThis way, you only calculate the unique models once instead of on every iteration.","status":200,"tokens":[0,473],"elapsed":36.706559983,"_type":"aimessage"}]
