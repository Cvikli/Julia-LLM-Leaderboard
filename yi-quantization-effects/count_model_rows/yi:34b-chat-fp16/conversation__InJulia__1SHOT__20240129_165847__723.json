For each model, we filter the rows with that model using `filter` and then count the number of rows in the filtered DataFrame using `size`. Finally, we store the counts in a dictionary where the keys are the models and the values are the counts.\n\nPlease note that this example assumes that you have a `DataFrame` named `df_cars` with a column called `model`. The `other_cols` is used to indicate that there may be other columns in your DataFrame, but they are not necessary for this function. You would replace the ellipses (`[..]`) with the actual data you want to include in your `DataFrame`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,474],"elapsed":36.761314823,"_type":"aimessage"}]
