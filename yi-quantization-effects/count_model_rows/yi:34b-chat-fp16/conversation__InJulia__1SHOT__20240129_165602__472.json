Below is an example of how you might define the `count_model_rows` function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return combine(groupby(df, :model), nrow => identity)\nend\n\n# Example usage with a hypothetical df_cars\ndf_cars = # Your data here\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(\"Number of rows for each model:\")\ndisplay(result)\n```\n\nThis function assumes that your `DataFrame` has a column named `:model`. The `groupby` function groups the data by this column, and then `combine` is used to combine the grouped data into a new `DataFrame` with one row per group, where each column is an aggregate of the corresponding column in the original data. In this case, we're using `nrow` to get the number of rows in each group and `identity` as the aggregation function, which simply returns the input value (the count) without any transformation.\n\nMake sure to replace `# Your data here` with your actual `DataFrame` containing the `:model` column. The result will be a new `DataFrame` where each row represents a unique model and the corresponding count of rows for that model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,335],"elapsed":25.958807628,"_type":"aimessage"}]
