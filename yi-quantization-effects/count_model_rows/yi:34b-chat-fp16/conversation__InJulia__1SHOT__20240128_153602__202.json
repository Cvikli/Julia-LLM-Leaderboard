Uses `by` to group the data by the `model` column.\n2. Iterates over the grouped data and creates a dictionary where each key is a model and its value is the number of rows for that model.\n3. Prints out the counts for each model.\n\nMake sure to replace the `df_cars` example with your actual `DataFrame`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,327],"elapsed":25.331130203,"_type":"aimessage"}]
