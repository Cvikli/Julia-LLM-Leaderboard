Below is an example of how you might define such a function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    models = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = map(models) do model_group\n        length(model_group)  # or `size(model_group, 1)` if you want the number of columns too\n    end\n    return counts\nend\n\n# Example usage with a hypothetical DataFrame df_cars:\ndf_cars = # Your data here\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(\"Number of rows for each model:\")\nprintln(counts)\n```\n\nThis function groups the DataFrame by the `:model` column and then applies a mapping function that returns the length of each group. The result is a vector containing the number of rows for each model.\n\nIf you want to include the model names as well, you can modify the function to return a dictionary or a named tuple with counts and models:\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    models = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = Dict{String, Int}()\n    for model in models\n        model_name = first(model).model # Get the first row to get the model name\n        counts[model_name] = length(model)\n    end\n    return counts\nend\n```\n\nThis function will return a dictionary where the keys are the model names and the values are the corresponding counts. You can then print or further process this information as needed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,396],"elapsed":11.204397279,"_type":"aimessage"}]
