Here's an example of how you might write such a function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    # Group the data by model column\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    \n    # Use combine to calculate the number of rows for each group\n    counts = combine(grouped, :nrow => sum)\n    \n    return counts\nend\n\n# Example usage with a hypothetical DataFrame df_cars\ndf_cars = # Your data here\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `# Your data here` with the actual contents of your `df_cars` DataFrame. The `groupby` function returns a GroupedDataFrame, which is then combined using `combine` to calculate the sum of rows for each group (in this case, the number of rows per model).\n\nIf you want to include the original columns from the DataFrame in the result, you can add them to the `combine` function as well:\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame; include_all_columns=false)\n    # Group the data by model column\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    \n    # Combine the grouped DataFrame, including all columns if specified\n    if include_all_columns\n        counts = combine(grouped, [:nrow => sum], copycols=false)\n    else\n        counts = combine(grouped, :nrow => sum)\n    end\n    \n    return counts\nend\n```\n\nNow you can call the function with or without including all columns from the original DataFrame by setting `include_all_columns` to `true` or `false`, respectively.\n\nRemember to use `copycols=false` when combining if you don't want a copy of the original columns (which is usually not necessary if you're only interested in the count).","status":200,"tokens":[0,497],"elapsed":14.383416555,"_type":"aimessage"}]
