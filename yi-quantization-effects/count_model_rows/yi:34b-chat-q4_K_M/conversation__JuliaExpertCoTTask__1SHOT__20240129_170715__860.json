Since there are duplicates in the `model` column, the count for \"a4\" is 3, while others have a count of 1. The result is returned as a dictionary where the keys are the distinct model names and the values are their respective row counts.","status":200,"tokens":[0,316],"elapsed":9.158631521,"_type":"aimessage"}]
