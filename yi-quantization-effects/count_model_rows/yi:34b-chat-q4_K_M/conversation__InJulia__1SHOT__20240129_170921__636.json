The function will return an array of counts, where each count corresponds to the number of rows in the DataFrame for the corresponding group (i.e., model).\n\nIf you want to print out the counts for all models, you can do something like this:\n\n```julia\nfor i in 1:length(model_counts)\n    println(\"There are $(model_counts[i]) rows for the $i-th model.\")\nend\n```\n\nThis will iterate over each count and print the number of rows for that model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,365],"elapsed":10.547900748,"_type":"aimessage"}]
