Here's an example of how to create such a function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    # Group the data by the 'model' column\n    groups = groupby(df, :model)\n\n    # Iterate over each group and count the number of rows in it\n    counts = Dict()\n    for model in unique(df.model)\n        rows_group = first(filter(g -> g.model == model, groups))\n        counts[model] = length(rows_group)\n    end\n\n    # Return the counts as a DataFrame for easier printing/displaying\n    return DataFrame(model=collect(keys(counts)), count=collect(values(counts)))\nend\n\n# Example usage with a hypothetical `df_cars` DataFrame\ndf_cars = # Your actual data here\nprintln(\"Number of rows per model:\")\nprintln(count_model_rows(df_cars))\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `# Your actual data here` with the actual `DataFrame` you want to work with. The function first groups the data by the `:model` column, then iterates over each unique model and counts the number of rows for that model. Finally, it returns a new `DataFrame` with the counts for each model.\n\nIf you have any other columns in your `DataFrame` that you want to keep in the output, you can modify the function to include those as well.","status":200,"tokens":[0,369],"elapsed":10.640848487,"_type":"aimessage"}]
