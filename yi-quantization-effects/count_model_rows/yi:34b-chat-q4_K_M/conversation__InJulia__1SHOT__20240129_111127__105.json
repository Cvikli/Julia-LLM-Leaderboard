It then iterates over each group, getting the first row of each group to retrieve the model name, and counts the number of rows for that model. Finally, it stores these counts in a dictionary where the keys are the model names and the values are the count of rows.\n\nTo use this function with your `df_cars` DataFrame, you would call it as follows:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\n# Assuming df_cars is already defined\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThis will give you a dictionary where each key is a model name and the value is the number of rows for that model in `df_cars`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,364],"elapsed":10.496131058,"_type":"aimessage"}]
