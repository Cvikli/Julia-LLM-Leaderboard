Here's how you can define the function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    # Group the data by model and calculate the number of rows for each group\n    grouped_models = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = [length(g) for g in grouped_models]\n    return counts\nend\n```\n\nNow you can call this function on your `df_cars` DataFrame:\n\n```julia\n# Assuming df_cars is defined and contains a 'model' column\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThe `counts` variable will contain an array with the number of rows for each unique model in the `df_cars` DataFrame.\n\nIf you want to also get the models themselves, you can modify the function to return a dictionary where the keys are the models and the values are the counts:\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    # Group the data by model and calculate the number of rows for each group\n    grouped_models = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = Dict()\n    for g in grouped_models\n        model = first(g.model) # Get the first value of the 'model' column as a representative\n        counts[model] = length(g)\n    end\n    return counts\nend\n```\n\nThis function will return a dictionary where each key is a unique model and the corresponding value is the number of rows with that model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,395],"elapsed":11.174430557,"_type":"aimessage"}]
