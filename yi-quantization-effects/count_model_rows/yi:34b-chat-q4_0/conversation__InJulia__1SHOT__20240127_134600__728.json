Here's an example of how to write such a function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = Dict()\n    for model in unique(df.model)\n        row_count = length(df[grouped[model], :])\n        counts[model] = row_count\n    end\n    return counts\nend\n\n# Example usage with a hypothetical df_cars DataFrame\ndf_cars = # Your data frame here\nmodel_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(model_counts)\n```\n\nIn this function, `groupby` groups the rows of the DataFrame according to the specified column. Then, for each unique model in the grouped DataFrame, we calculate the number of rows using `length` and store it in a dictionary where the keys are the models and the values are the corresponding counts. Finally, we return the dictionary with the count for each model.\n\nMake sure to replace `# Your data frame here` with your actual `df_cars` DataFrame. The `println(model_counts)` statement prints the resulting dictionary to the console.","status":200,"tokens":[58,316],"elapsed":8.486875183,"_type":"aimessage"}]
