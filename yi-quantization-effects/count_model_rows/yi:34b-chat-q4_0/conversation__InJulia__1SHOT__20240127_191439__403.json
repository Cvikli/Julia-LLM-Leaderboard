Finally, it returns a dictionary where the keys are the unique models and the values are the counts of their corresponding rows.\n\nTo use this function with your DataFrame `df_cars`, you would call it like so:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames # If you haven't already imported DataFrames\n\n# Assuming df_cars is a DataFrame with a 'model' column\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(\"Number of rows for each model:\")\nfor (model, count) in counts\n    println(\"$model: $count\")\nend\n```\n\nThis will print out the number of rows for each unique model in your `df_cars` DataFrame.\n\nIf you are using a more recent version of Julia and DataFrames, you might want to use groupby functionality provided by DataFrames.jl which is much more efficient than iterating over the entire dataset:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return df |>\n        groupby(_ => _.model) |>\n        combine(_ => length(_))\nend\n\n# Example usage with a DataFrame named df_cars\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(\"Number of rows for each model:\")\nfor (model, count) in counts\n    println(\"$model: $count\")\nend\n```\n\nThis will give you the same result but using a more concise and efficient syntax.","status":200,"tokens":[0,497],"elapsed":13.163141115,"_type":"aimessage"}]
