Here's an example of how to write such a function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return combine(groupby(df, :model), nrow => :count)\nend\n\n# Example usage with a hypothetical `df_cars` DataFrame\ndf_cars = # Your data here\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThis function groups the rows by the `model` column and then combines each group into a single row, calculating the count of rows in that group using the `nrow` function. The result is a new DataFrame with the models as columns and their respective counts as values.\n\nIf you want to include the model names as well, you can modify the function like this:\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return combine(groupby(df, :model), nrow => :count, identity => identity)\nend\n\n# Example usage with a hypothetical `df_cars` DataFrame\ndf_cars = # Your data here\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThis will return a DataFrame where each row is a model and the first column contains the model names, while the second column contains the counts of rows for each model.\n\nRemember to replace `# Your data here` with the actual content of your `DataFrame` called `df_cars` in your Julia script or REPL session.","status":200,"tokens":[0,368],"elapsed":13.646225036,"_type":"aimessage"}]
