The `isuppercasefirstletter` function (defined below) checks if the first letter of a string is uppercase.\n\nHere's the definition of `isuppercasefirstletter`:\n\n```julia\nfunction isuppercasefirstletter(word)\n    return isascii(word) && isuppercase(word[1])\nend\n```\nThe `isascii` function checks if all characters in the string are ASCII characters, and `isuppercase` checks if the first character of the word (index 1) is uppercase. This function assumes that the input words are ASCII characters only, which is a reasonable assumption for English language processing.","status":200,"tokens":[0,205],"elapsed":5.403804747,"_type":"aimessage"}]
