It then uses this regex to check each word in the list and adds it to another list if the regex matches. Finally, it returns this new list of words that start with a capital letter.\n\nYou can call this function like so:\n\n```julia\njulia> keep_only_names([\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"dog\"])\n3-element Vector{String}:\n \"Dog\"\n \"cat\"\n \"dog\"\n```\n\nNotice that in the example output, both \"Dog\" and \"cat\" are kept because they start with a capital letter, while \"dog\" is not included since it does not.","status":200,"tokens":[0,323],"elapsed":8.526910908,"_type":"aimessage"}]
