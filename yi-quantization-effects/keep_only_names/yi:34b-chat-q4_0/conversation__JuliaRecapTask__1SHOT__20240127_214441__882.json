[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{AbstractString})::Vector{AbstractString}\n    # 1. Filter out words that do not start with a capital letter\n    capitalized_words = filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\n\n    # 2. Return the filtered list\n    return capitalized_words\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- We use `filter` to iteratively check each word in the list and keep only those that start with a capital letter using `isuppercase(word[1])`. This checks if the first character of the word is uppercase or not.\n- Finally, we return the filtered list of words.\n\nDouble-check:\n- The function signature matches the requirements, accepting a vector of strings and returning a vector of strings.\n- We use `AbstractString` as a type annotation for clarity and flexibility with different string types.\n- No additional packages are required, as we're using standard Julia libraries and features.\n- The logic is straightforward and should perform well, as it iterates over the list only once to filter out items.","status":200,"tokens":[0,248],"elapsed":6.648623307,"_type":"aimessage"}]
