If it does, the word is included in the returned list; otherwise, it is skipped. The `isuppercasefirstletter` function can be defined as follows:\n\n```julia\nfunction isuppercasefirstletter(word)\n    return isascii(word[1]) && isuppercase(word[1])\nend\n```\n\nThis predicate assumes that the words are ASCII and checks if the first character of a word is uppercase.","status":200,"tokens":[0,158],"elapsed":4.160658681,"_type":"aimessage"}]
