[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    new_words = String[]\n    for word in words\n        if startswith(word, uppercasefirst(word))\n            push!(new_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return new_words\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. We define a function `keep_only_names` that takes in a vector of strings `words`.\n2. We initialize an empty vector called `new_words` to store the filtered list.\n3. Inside the for loop, we check if the word starts with its first letter capitalized (using `uppercasefirst`) and add it to the new vector only if it does not conflict with itself (i.e., if the word is already capitalized).\n4. After the loop, we return the `new_words` vector which contains only those words that start with a capital letter.\n5. We use `startswith` to check if the first character of the word matches its first character uppercased, ensuring that \"dog\" would not be kept but \"Dog\" would.\n6. The function itself does not modify the original list `words`; instead, it creates a new, filtered copy.\n\nDouble-check:\n- We have checked for capitalization without being case-insensitive (e.g., 'dog' and 'Dog' are considered different).\n- The function is designed to work with lists of strings, as per the instructions.\n- It does not rely on any external packages beyond Julia's standard library.\n- The performance should be good because we only iterate over the list once and add elements to a vector.","status":200,"tokens":[379,377],"elapsed":10.363179411,"_type":"aimessage"}]
