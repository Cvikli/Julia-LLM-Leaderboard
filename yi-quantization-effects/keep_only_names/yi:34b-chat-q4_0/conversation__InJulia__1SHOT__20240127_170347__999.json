This pattern asserts that a word must start with an uppercase letter followed by zero or more lowercase or uppercase letters. If a word matches this pattern, it is added to the new array `names`. Finally, `keep_only_names` returns the `names` array containing only words that start with a capital letter.\n\nTo use this function, simply call it with your list of words:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"cat\", \"Dog\", \"Mouse\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words) # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Mouse\"]\n```\n\nRemember that Julia is case-insensitive by default for strings, so if you want to preserve the case of the words (e.g., keep both \"dog\" and \"Dog\"), you would need to adjust the regex or use a different approach.","status":200,"tokens":[68,398],"elapsed":10.677014557,"_type":"aimessage"}]
