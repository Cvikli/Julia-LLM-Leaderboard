Below is an example of how you might implement such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    kept_words = String[]\n    for word in words\n        if startswith(word, uppercase(first(word))) # Check if the word starts with a capital letter\n            push!(kept_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return kept_words\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nnames = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"dog\", \"Fish\", \"bird\"]\nfiltered_names = keep_only_names(names)\nprintln(filtered_names)\n```\n\nIn this code snippet, the `keep_only_names` function first initializes an empty array of strings called `kept_words`. It then iterates over each word in the `words` list using a for loop. For each word, it checks if the word starts with a capital letter by comparing the uppercase version of the first character to the entire word in uppercase. If the condition is met, the word is added to the `kept_words` array. Finally, the function returns the `kept_words` array.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how you might call the `keep_only_names` function with a list of words and prints out the filtered names to the console.","status":200,"tokens":[68,339],"elapsed":9.111255632,"_type":"aimessage"}]
