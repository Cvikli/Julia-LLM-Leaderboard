[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    lowercase_words = [word.lower() for word in words]\n    unique_capitalized_words = filter(x -> startswith(x, uppercase(first(x))), lowercase_words)\n    return unique_capitalized_words\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- We first convert the list of `String`s into a lowercase version to compare the initial letter without regard to case.\n- Then we use `filter` with a predicate that checks if the first character of each word (after converting it to uppercase) matches the first character of the entire word in lowercase. This ensures that we only keep words that start with a capital letter, regardless of the case of the input.\n- Finally, we return the unique list of capitalized words.\n\nPlease note that Julia's string type is `String` and not `str` as in Python. Also, the method `lower()` is used to convert strings to lowercase, while `uppercase(first(x))` is used to get the first character of a word in uppercase.","status":200,"tokens":[0,252],"elapsed":6.748397339,"_type":"aimessage"}]
