[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Initialize an empty vector to store the filtered words\n    result = Vector{String}()\n    \n    for word in words\n        if startswith(word, uppercasefirst(word)) # Check if the word starts with its own capitalized form\n            push!(result, word) # Add the word to the result vector if it passes the check\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- We define a function `keep_only_names` that takes in a vector of strings as input.\n- The function iterates over each word in the `words` vector using a for loop.\n- Inside the loop, we check if the current word starts with its own capitalized form using the `startswith` function combined with `uppercasefirst` to convert the first character to upper case.\n- If the condition is met, we use `push!` to add the word to the result vector named `result`.\n- Finally, we return the `result` vector which contains only the words that start with a capital letter, as per the task requirements.\n\nDouble-check:\n- The function signature matches the task's input and output types.\n- We are using a built-in function (`startswith`) and the Julia standard library function (`uppercasefirst`) to perform the check, adhering to the guidance on standard libraries.\n- The function does not use any type that is discouraged in the guidelines (e.g., `String` instead of `AbstractString`).\n- There are no conflicts with reserved names or Julia's syntax.\n- The logic correctly filters out words based on their capitalization, keeping only those that start with a capital letter as specified in the task.","status":200,"tokens":[0,401],"elapsed":10.782342375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
