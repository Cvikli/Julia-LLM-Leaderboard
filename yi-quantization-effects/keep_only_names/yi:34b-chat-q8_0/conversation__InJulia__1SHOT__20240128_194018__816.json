Here's how you could define such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Filter the words keeping only those that start with a capital letter\n    return filter(w -> isuppercase(first(w)), words)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nsome_words = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"mouse\", \"House\"]\nclean_names = keep_only_names(some_words)\nprintln(\"Cleaned names:\", clean_names)\n```\n\nThis function uses the `filter` built-in function to filter out the words from `words` that do not start with a capital letter. It does this by checking if the first character of each word is uppercase using the `isuppercase(c)` function. If it is, the word is kept; otherwise, it is discarded.\n\nWhen you call the `keep_only_names` function with an example list of words, it prints out the cleaned list of names that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,259],"elapsed":11.612008722,"_type":"aimessage"}]
