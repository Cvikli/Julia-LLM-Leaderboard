[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"If there are no special instructions provided, I would proceed with the following solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    return [word for word in words if startswith(word, uppercase(first(word)))]\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a list comprehension to filter the `words` vector and retain only those strings that start with an uppercase letter. The `startswith` function is used to check this condition, and the `uppercase` function is applied to the first character of each word to ensure case-insensitivity.\n\nTo double-check the solution:\n\n1. Ensure that the function type annotations are correct.\n2. Test the function with a list of words containing both lowercase and uppercase names, making sure that only the names starting with an uppercase letter are retained.\n3. Check for performance by testing it on large lists of words.\n4. Verify that the function does not remove words that should be kept due to edge cases (e.g., acronyms like \"API\" or initialisms).\n5. Ensure that the function works correctly when passed a list of words with varying lengths and characters.\n\nIf there are special instructions provided, I would adapt the solution accordingly:\n\n```julia\n# Example Special Instructions:\n# - Words should be considered in their entirety, not just by their first letter.\n# - The function should also remove non-word characters (e.g., punctuation) from each word before checking for capitalization.\n\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Remove non-word characters from each word\n    clean_words = map(w -> replace(w, r\"[^a-zA-Z]\" => \"\"), words)\n    # Filter out words that do not start with an uppercase letter\n    return [word for word in clean_words if startswith(word, uppercase(first(word)))]\nend\n```\n\nIn this case, the special instructions are implemented by first cleaning the words using a custom function `replace` to remove non-word characters, and then applying the same filter as before.","status":200,"tokens":[0,488],"elapsed":22.199092638,"_type":"aimessage"}]
