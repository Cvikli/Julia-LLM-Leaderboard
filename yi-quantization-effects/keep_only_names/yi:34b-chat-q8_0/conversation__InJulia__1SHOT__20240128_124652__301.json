In this case, we are checking if it starts with an uppercase letter from 'A' to 'Z'. The `uppercase('A':'Z')` part converts all characters in the range 'A' to 'Z' to uppercase before checking.\n\nThe `push!` function is used to add elements to the end of a vector. It appends the word to the `new_words` vector if it passes the filter. Finally, the `return new_words` statement returns the filtered list of words.","status":200,"tokens":[0,413],"elapsed":18.541898065,"_type":"aimessage"}]
