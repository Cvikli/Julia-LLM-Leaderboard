It then iterates over the list of words and uses `occsin` to check if each word matches this pattern. If it does, `push!` is used to add the word to the output array. Finally, the function returns the filtered list of words.","status":200,"tokens":[0,211],"elapsed":7.815998153,"_type":"aimessage"}]
