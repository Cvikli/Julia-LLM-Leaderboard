[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Initializing an empty vector to store the filtered words\n    filtered_words = Vector{String}()\n\n    # Iterate over each word in the list\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the word starts with a capital letter\n        if ismatch(r\"^[A-Z]\", word) # Regular expression to match capital letters\n            # Add the word to the filtered list if it passes the check\n            push!(filtered_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\nThis function defines a `keep_only_names` function that takes a vector of strings (`words`) and returns another vector containing only those strings that start with a capital letter. It does this by iterating over the input vector and using a regular expression to check if each word starts with a capital letter. If it does, the word is added to the filtered list.\n\nThe `ismatch` function from the standard library's `Regex` module is used to match the pattern without capturing groups or global matching. It returns a boolean indicating whether there was a match for the specified pattern.\n\nThis solution assumes that all words are separated by spaces and that the input vector contains only strings (no other types). If you need to handle more complex scenarios, such as words with multiple capital letters or non-standard word separators, you would need to adapt the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,328],"elapsed":12.334264738,"_type":"aimessage"}]
