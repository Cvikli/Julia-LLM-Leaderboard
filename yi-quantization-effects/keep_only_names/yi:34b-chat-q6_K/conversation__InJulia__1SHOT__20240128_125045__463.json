Here's how you can define such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Create an empty array to store the filtered words\n    names = Array{String,1}()\n\n    # Iterate over each word in the list\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the word starts with a capital letter\n        if isuppercase(first(word))\n            # If yes, add it to the names array\n            push!(names, word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return names\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes in an array of strings `words` and returns an array containing only those words that start with a capital letter. The `isuppercase` function is used to check if the first character of each word is uppercase.\n\nYou can test this function as follows:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"fish\", \"Fruit\", \"tiger\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names)  # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Fruit\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, the words `\"dog\"` and `\"fish\"` are removed because they do not start with a capital letter, while `\"Cat\"`, `\"Fruit\"`, and `\"tiger\"` are kept.","status":200,"tokens":[0,340],"elapsed":12.60400703,"_type":"aimessage"}]
