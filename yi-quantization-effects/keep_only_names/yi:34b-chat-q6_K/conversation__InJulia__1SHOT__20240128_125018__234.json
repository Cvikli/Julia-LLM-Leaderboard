Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Initialize an empty array to store the filtered words\n    capitalized_words = Vector{String}()\n\n    # Iterate over each word in the list\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the word starts with a capital letter\n        if startswith(word, uppercase('A':'Z'))\n            # Append the word to the new array if it does\n            push!(capitalized_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return capitalized_words\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of words `words` and returns a vector containing only those words that start with a capital letter. It does this by iterating over each word in the list and using the `startswith()` function to check if the word starts with an uppercase letter from 'A' to 'Z'. If it does, the word is appended to the `capitalized_words` vector.\n\nYou can call this function with a list of words like so:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\nsome_words = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"apple\", \"Zebra\", \"toy\"]\ncleaned_names = keep_only_names(some_words)\nprintln(cleaned_names) # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Zebra\"]\n```\n\nIn the above example, `keep_only_names` returns a vector containing only \"Cat\" and \"Zebra\" because these are the only two words that start with a capital letter. The rest of the words (\"dog\", \"apple\", \"toy\") are not included in the returned vector.","status":200,"tokens":[0,420],"elapsed":15.584929349,"_type":"aimessage"}]
