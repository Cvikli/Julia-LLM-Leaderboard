Here's how you can define the `keep_only_names` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Use filter to keep only words that start with an uppercase letter\n    return collect(filter((word) -> word[1] == uppercasefirst(word[1]), words))\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nsome_words = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"apple\", \"Zebra\", \"pear\", \"Salmon\"]\ncleaned_names = keep_only_names(some_words)\nprintln(cleaned_names)  # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Zebra\", \"Salmon\"]\n```\n\nThe `keep_only_names` function uses the `filter` built-in function to iterate over the list of words (`words`) and filter out any word that does not start with a capital letter. The predicate function checks if the first character of each word is equal to its uppercase version, ensuring that it's either already uppercase or can be uppercase (e.g., \"cat\" would pass this check because \"C\" == \"C\").\n\nThe `uppercasefirst` function is used to convert the first letter of a word to uppercase without altering the remaining letters. This is necessary because we want to keep both words that are entirely uppercase and those that start with a lowercase letter but should be capitalized (like \"cat\" becoming \"Cat\").\n\nThe `collect` function is used after the filter to convert the result into an Array, which is returned as the output of the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,399],"elapsed":14.801854894,"_type":"aimessage"}]
