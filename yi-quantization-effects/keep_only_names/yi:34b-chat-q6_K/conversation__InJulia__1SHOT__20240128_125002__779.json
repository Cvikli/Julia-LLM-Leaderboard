It does this by iterating over the original list, checking each word with the `occsin` function to see if it contains any characters from the range of uppercase letters (A-Z) in its first position. If so, it is added to the new list.","status":200,"tokens":[68,222],"elapsed":8.372254012,"_type":"aimessage"}]
