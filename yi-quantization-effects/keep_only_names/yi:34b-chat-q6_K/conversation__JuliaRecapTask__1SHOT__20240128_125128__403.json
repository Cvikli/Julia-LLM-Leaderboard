[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Create an empty vector to store the filtered words\n    filtered_words = Vector{String}(undef, 0)\n    \n    # Iterate over each word in the original list\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the word starts with a capital letter\n        if ismatch(r\"^[A-Z]\", word)\n            # If yes, add it to the filtered list\n            push!(filtered_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Return the filtered list of words\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\n### Solution Explanation:\n\n1. The function `keep_only_names` is defined to take a vector of strings `words` as input.\n2. An empty vector `filtered_words` is created to store the words that meet the condition (starting with a capital letter).\n3. A regex pattern `r\"^[A-Z]\"` is used to match if the word starts with a capital letter.\n4. Using a for loop, each word in `words` is checked against this pattern.\n5. If the pattern matches, the word is pushed into the `filtered_words` vector.\n6. Finally, `filtered_words` is returned as the result of the function.\n\n### Double-Checking:\n\n1. The function correctly filters out words that do not start with a capital letter.\n2. It does not modify the original list `words` but instead creates a new filtered list.\n3. The use of regex for string matching is efficient and concise.\n4. The function is generic in the sense that it works for any vector of strings, not just lists of names.\n5. The performance should be good since we are only checking each word once using regex matching.","status":200,"tokens":[0,410],"elapsed":15.411215784,"_type":"aimessage"}]
