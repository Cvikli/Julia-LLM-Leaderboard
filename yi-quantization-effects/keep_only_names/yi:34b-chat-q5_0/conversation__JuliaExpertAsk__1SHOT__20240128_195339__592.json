It then iterates over the provided list of words and uses `ismissing(word)` to check if each word starts with a capital letter. If it does, the word is added to the `capitalized_words` array using `push!`. Finally, the function returns the array of filtered words.","status":200,"tokens":[98,232],"elapsed":7.514577335,"_type":"aimessage"}]
