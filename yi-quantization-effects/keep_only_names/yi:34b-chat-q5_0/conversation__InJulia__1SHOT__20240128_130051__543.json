The function returns a new list containing the filtered words.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector)\n    # Initialize an empty vector to store the filtered words\n    capitalized_words = Vector{String}()\n\n    # Iterate over each word in the list\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the word starts with a capital letter\n        if startswith(word, uppercasefirst(word))\n            # If it does, add it to the new list\n            push!(capitalized_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return capitalized_words\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nlet words = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"doggie\", \"Zebra\", \"zoo\"]\n    filtered_words = keep_only_names(words)\n    println(\"Filtered words are: $filtered_words\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `startswith` function to check if a word starts with its own first letter in uppercase, and the `uppercasefirst` function to convert the first letter of a word to uppercase. The resulting vector `capitalized_words` is then returned as the filtered list.","status":200,"tokens":[0,302],"elapsed":9.569725525,"_type":"aimessage"}]
