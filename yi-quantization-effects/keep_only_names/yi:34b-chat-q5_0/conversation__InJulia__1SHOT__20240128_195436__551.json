The `uppercase(first(word))` part converts the first character of the word to upper case for comparison. If the condition is met, the word is added to the `new_words` array using `push!`. Finally, `return new_words` gives back the filtered list of words.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\njulia> keep_only_names([\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"tiger\"])\n3-element Array{String,1}:\n \"Dog\"\n \"cat\"\n \"tiger\"\n```\n\nNotice that the lowercase \"dog\" is removed because it does not start with a capital letter, while \"Dog\", \"cat\", and \"tiger\" are all kept.","status":200,"tokens":[0,334],"elapsed":10.593067009,"_type":"aimessage"}]
