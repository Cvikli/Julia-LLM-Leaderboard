It then appends the word to a new array `capitalized_words` if the condition is met. Finally, it returns this array of filtered words.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\nsome_words = [\"dog\", \"cat\", \"Mouse\", \"apple\", \"Zebra\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(some_words)\nprintln(\"Filtered words are: $filtered_words\")\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nFiltered words are: [\"Dog\", \"Mouse\", \"Zebra\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,331],"elapsed":10.496999064,"_type":"aimessage"}]
