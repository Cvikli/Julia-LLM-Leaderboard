The helper function `iscapitalized` checks if the word meets the criteria for being a name (first character uppercase, rest alphanumeric).\n\nYou can test this function like so:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\nnames = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"dog\", \"Mouse\", \"mouse\"]\nfiltered_names = keep_only_names(names)\n\nprintln(\"Filtered names are: $filtered_names\")\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nFiltered names are: [\"Dog\", \"Mouse\"]\n```\n\nNote that the `keep_only_names` function assumes that all words are separated by spaces and that the input list is a vector of strings. If your input has a different structure, you may need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,397],"elapsed":12.607754977,"_type":"aimessage"}]
