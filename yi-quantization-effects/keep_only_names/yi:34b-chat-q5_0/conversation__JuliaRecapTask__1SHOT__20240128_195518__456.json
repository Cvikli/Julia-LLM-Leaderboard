[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Initialize an empty array to store the filtered words\n    capitalized_words = Array{String, 1}()\n    \n    # Iterate over each word in the original list\n    for w in words\n        # Check if the first character of the word is uppercase\n        if isupper(first(w))\n            # If yes, add it to the new array\n            push!(capitalized_words, w)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return capitalized_words\nend\n```\n\n### Step 1: Recall Julia Snippets\n- The `isupper` function checks if a character is uppercase.\n- The `first` function gets the first element of a collection.\n- The `push!` function appends an element to the end of an array and returns it.\n- The `Array{String, 1}` syntax defines an Array with elements of type String and dimension 1.\n\n### Step 2: Solve the Task\n- The function iterates over each word in the `words` list using a for loop.\n- It checks if the first character of the word is uppercase using `isupper(first(w))`.\n- If the check passes, the word is added to the new array `capitalized_words` using `push!`.\n- The function returns the array `capitalized_words` containing only words that start with a capital letter.\n\n### Step 3: Double-check that the Solution is Correct\n- The solution should work for any list of strings, regardless of their content or length.\n- It handles cases where multiple consecutive words may start with a capital letter correctly by checking each word individually.\n- The function does not modify the original `words` list; it creates a new array without altering the input data.\n\n### Additional Notes\n- This solution is concise and efficient, as it only iterates over the words once and appends them to the new array.\n- It does not use any external libraries, adhering to the guidelines provided.\n- The function is general enough to work with any type of string that has an uppercase first character without being too restrictive.","status":200,"tokens":[0,481],"elapsed":15.55183404,"_type":"aimessage"}]
