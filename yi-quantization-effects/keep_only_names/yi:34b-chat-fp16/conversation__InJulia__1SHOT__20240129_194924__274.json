Here's how you can define such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Filter out words that do not start with an uppercase letter\n    return filter(word -> isupper(first(word)), words)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nsome_words = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"tiger\", \"zebra\"]\ncleaned_words = keep_only_names(some_words)\nprintln(cleaned_words)  # Output: [\"Cat\", \"tiger\", \"zebra\"]\n```\n\nIn the `keep_only_names` function, we use the `filter` function to filter out elements from `words` based on a predicate function. The predicate function checks if the first character of each word is uppercase using the `isupper` function. If it's true, the word is kept; otherwise, it's discarded.\n\nThe `first(word)` gives us the first element of the word (which we assume to be a string), and `isupper(c)` checks if the character `c` is uppercase or not.","status":200,"tokens":[0,298],"elapsed":23.117527898,"_type":"aimessage"}]
