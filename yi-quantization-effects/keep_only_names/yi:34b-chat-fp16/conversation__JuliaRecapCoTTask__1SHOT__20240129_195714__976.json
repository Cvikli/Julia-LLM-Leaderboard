[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Given there are no special instructions provided, I will proceed to solve the task using the guidelines you've provided.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Initialize an empty vector to store the filtered words\n    filtered_words = Vector{String}()\n    \n    # Iterate over each word in the list\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the word starts with a capital letter\n        if isuppercase(word[1])\n            # If yes, add it to the filtered list\n            push!(filtered_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a vector of strings `words` and returns a new vector containing only those words that start with a capital letter. It uses the `isuppercase` function to check if the first character of each word is uppercase. If it is, the word is added to the `filtered_words` vector using `push!`.\n\nTo double-check that the solution is correct:\n\n1. Test the function with a few examples, both with and without capitalized words.\n2. Ensure that the function does not modify the original list of words (it should return a new list).\n3. Verify that the function works correctly for different lengths of input lists.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the function:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"apple\", \"Zebra\"]\nfiltered_names = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_names) # Output should be: [\"Cat\", \"Zebra\"]\n```\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that all words are lowercase except for the first letter. If a word contains multiple capitalized letters within it, only the first letter is considered for the filter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,421],"elapsed":32.928854442,"_type":"aimessage"}]
