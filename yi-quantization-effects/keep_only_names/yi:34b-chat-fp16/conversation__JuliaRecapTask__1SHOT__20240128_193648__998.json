[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Initialize an empty vector to store the filtered words\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, 0)\n\n    # Iterate over each word in the original list\n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(word[1])  # Check if the first letter is uppercase\n            push!(result, word) # If yes, add it to the result vector\n        end\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nThis function defines a new `Vector{String}` called `result` and initializes it with an empty array. It then iterates over each word in the `words` vector using a for loop. Within the loop, it uses the `isuppercase` function to check if the first letter of the current word is uppercase. If it is, the word is added to the `result` vector using `push!`.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `result` vector, which contains only those words from the original list that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,242],"elapsed":18.857847494,"_type":"aimessage"}]
