[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Recall Julia Snippets\n\nHere are some Julia snippets that might be useful for this task:\n\n```julia\n# Check if a word starts with a capital letter\nfunction starts_with_capital(word)\n    return isuppercase(word[1])\nend\n\n# Filter a list of words, keeping only those that start with a capital letter\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(starts_with_capital, words)\nend\n```\n\n# Solve the Task\n\nGiven the `words` list, we can use the `keep_only_names` function to filter out any words that do not start with a capital letter. Here's how you might implement it:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(word -> starts_with_capital(word), words)\nend\n\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"apple\", \"Zebra\"]\ncleaned_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(cleaned_words)  # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Zebra\"]\n```\n\n# Double-check the Solution\n\nTo ensure that the solution is correct, we can check the following:\n\n1. The `keep_only_names` function should only keep words that start with a capital letter.\n2. The function should work correctly for both single and multiple word inputs.\n3. The output should be a new array containing only the filtered words.\n\nBased on these checks, the provided solution appears to be correct.","status":200,"tokens":[0,348],"elapsed":27.131207039,"_type":"aimessage"}]
