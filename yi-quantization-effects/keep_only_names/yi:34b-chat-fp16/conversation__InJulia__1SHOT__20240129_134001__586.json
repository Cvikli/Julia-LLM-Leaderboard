Here's how you can define such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Initialize an empty array to store the filtered names\n    capitalized_names = Array{String, 1}()\n\n    # Iterate over each word in the list\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the word starts with a capital letter\n        if isstartswith(word, uppercasefirst(word))\n            # If yes, add it to the array of filtered names\n            push!(capitalized_names, word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return the array of filtered names\n    return capitalized_names\nend\n```\n\nThis function defines a `keep_only_names` function that takes an array of strings (`words`) as input and returns an array containing only those words that start with a capital letter. It does this by checking if the word is equal to its version where the first character is uppercased, indicating that it starts with a capital letter.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"apple\", \"Zebra\"]\ncapitalized_names = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(capitalized_names)  # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Zebra\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, the function `keep_only_names` removes \"dog\" and \"apple\" from the list because they do not start with a capital letter, while \"Cat\" and \"Zebra\" are kept since they meet the criteria.","status":200,"tokens":[0,400],"elapsed":31.008732945,"_type":"aimessage"}]
