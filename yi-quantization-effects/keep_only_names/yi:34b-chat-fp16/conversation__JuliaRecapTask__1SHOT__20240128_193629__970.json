[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Initialize an empty result vector\n    result = Vector{String}()\n\n    # Iterate over the words list\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the word starts with a capital letter\n        if isascii(word) && (word[1] >= 'A' && word[1] <= 'Z')\n            # If yes, append it to the result vector\n            push!(result, word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- We start by defining a function `keep_only_names` that takes in a vector of strings named `words`.\n- The body of the function initializes an empty vector called `result`, which will hold the words that satisfy our condition (starting with a capital letter).\n- We use a for loop to iterate over each word in the `words` vector.\n- Within the loop, we check if the first character of the word is between 'A' and 'Z' using a conditional statement and the `isascii` function to ensure that we only consider ASCII characters (since we are checking for capital letters).\n- If the condition is met, we use `push!` to add the word to the `result` vector.\n- Finally, we return the `result` vector which now contains all the words from `words` that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,324],"elapsed":25.27434191,"_type":"aimessage"}]
