It does this by iterating over each word in the original list and checking if the first character is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function. If the check passes, the word is added to the filtered list. Finally, the filtered list is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[98,222],"elapsed":17.218219028,"_type":"aimessage"}]
