It does this by iterating over the original list and using the `isupper` function to check if the first character of each word is uppercase. If it is, the word is added to a new array.\n\nYou can call this function and print the result like so:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"dog\", \"cat\", \"Mouse\", \"apple\", \"Orange\"]\ncapitalized_names = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(capitalized_names)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n[\"Dog\", \"Mouse\", \"Apple\", \"Orange\"]\n```\n\nNote that the function does not modify the original list `words`; it creates a new list of capitalized words.","status":200,"tokens":[0,352],"elapsed":27.277055888,"_type":"aimessage"}]
