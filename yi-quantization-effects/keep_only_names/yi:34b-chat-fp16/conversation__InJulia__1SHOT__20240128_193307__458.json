If you are using Julia 1.7 or later, you can use the `upperfirst` function instead:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Initialize an empty array to store the filtered words\n    capitalized_words = Vector{String}()\n\n    # Iterate over the list of words\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the first character of the word is uppercase\n        if upperfirst(word[1]) == word[1]\n            # Add the word to the new array if it's capitalized\n            push!(capitalized_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return capitalized_words\nend\n```\n\nThis function will return a vector of strings containing only those words from `words` that start with a capital letter. Note that both these functions assume that each word in the list is separated by whitespace and does not handle punctuation or multi-word entries. If you need to handle such cases, you would need to preprocess the input accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[68,400],"elapsed":31.029970136,"_type":"aimessage"}]
