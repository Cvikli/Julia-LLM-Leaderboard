The `uppercase` function is used to convert the first character of each word to uppercase before comparing it with the corresponding character of the word itself, which is already in uppercase due to the `startswith` function's behavior. The returned list contains only those words that satisfy the condition.","status":200,"tokens":[0,130],"elapsed":10.061959596,"_type":"aimessage"}]
