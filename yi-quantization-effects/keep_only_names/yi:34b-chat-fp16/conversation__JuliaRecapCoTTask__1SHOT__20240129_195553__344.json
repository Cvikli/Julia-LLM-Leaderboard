[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Julia Code for Task: `keep_only_names` Function\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Step 1: Filter out words that do not start with a capital letter\n    capitalized_words = filter(word -> startswith(uppercasefirst(word), word), words)\n    # Step 2: Return the filtered list\n    return capitalized_words\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses `filter` to iterate over the provided list of strings (`words`) and keeps only those that start with a capital letter. The `startswith` function is used to compare the uppercased first character of each word with the word itself, ensuring that the word starts with a capital letter.\n\n# Double-checking the Solution\n\nTo double-check that the solution is correct, we can write a test:\n\n```julia\nusing Test\n\n@testset \"keep_only_names function\" begin\n    # Example words list\n    example_words = [\"dog\", \"cat\", \"Dog\", \"Fish\"]\n    expected_result = [\"Dog\", \"Fish\"]\n\n    @test keep_only_names(example_words) == expected_result\nend\n```\n\nThis test uses `Test` package to assert that the `keep_only_names` function works as expected for a given example.","status":200,"tokens":[0,318],"elapsed":24.875002226,"_type":"aimessage"}]
