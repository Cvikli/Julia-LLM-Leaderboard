Here's how you can define the `keep_only_names` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Using a for loop to iterate over words and filter out lowercase words\n    result = String[]\n    for word in words\n        if isascii(word) && word[1] >= 'A' && word[1] <= 'Z' # Check if the first character is uppercase ASCII\n            push!(result, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use a `filter` function with a predicate to achieve the same:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Using filter to remove words that don't start with an uppercase letter\n    result = String[]\n    for word in words\n        if isascii(word) && word[1] >= 'A' && word[1] <= 'Z'\n            push!(result, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nBoth of these functions will take a list of strings `words` and return a new list containing only those words that start with a capital letter. The `isascii` function is used to ensure that we're checking ASCII characters, as the comparison operators (`>=` and `<=`) work only for ASCII characters by default in Julia.\n\nYou can call this function with a list of words like so:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"dog\", \"Hat\"]\nkept_names = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(kept_names)  # Output will be: [\"Dog\", \"Hat\"]\n```\n\nRemember that the `keep_only_names` function expects a list of strings, so make sure to pass an array or another collection of strings when calling it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,467],"elapsed":36.312129192,"_type":"aimessage"}]
