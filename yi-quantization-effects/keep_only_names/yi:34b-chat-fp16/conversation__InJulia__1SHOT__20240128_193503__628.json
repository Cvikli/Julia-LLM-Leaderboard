Here's how you can define such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Initialize an empty array to store the filtered words\n    names = String[]\n\n    # Iterate over each word in the list\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the word starts with a capital letter\n        if isabbrev(word, true) # or use startswith(uppercase(word[1]), word)\n            # If yes, add it to the names array\n            push!(names, word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return names\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, `isabbrev(str::AbstractString, is_long=true)` from the `Dates` package (since Julia 1.7) is used to check if a string is an abbreviation or not. If it's set to `true` (which is the default), it checks for both single-letter and multi-letter abbreviations. Since we are looking for names that start with a capital letter, this function can be used effectively.\n\nAlternatively, if you are using an older version of Julia or want to avoid using the `Dates` package, you can use `startswith(uppercase(word[1]), word)` to check if the first character of the word is the same as the word itself when both are converted to uppercase.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\nusing Dates # If using `isabbrev`\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"apple\", \"Zebra\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names)  # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Zebra\"]\n```\n\nIf you're not using Julia 1.7 or above and don't want to use the `Dates` package, you can define the function like this:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Initialize an empty array to store the filtered words\n    names = String[]\n\n    for word in words\n        if startswith(uppercase(word[1]), word)\n            push!(names, word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return names\nend\n```\n\nThis function will keep only those words that start with a capital letter and are not abbreviations (e.g., \"Cat\" is kept but \"dog\" is removed).","status":200,"tokens":[0,594],"elapsed":46.1572728,"_type":"aimessage"}]
