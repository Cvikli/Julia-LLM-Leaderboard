Here's how you can define such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Initialize an empty array to store the names\n    names = []\n\n    # Iterate over each word in the list\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the word starts with a capital letter\n        if isuppercase(first(word))\n            # If yes, push it to the names array\n            push!(names, word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return names\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of words (`words`) and returns a new list containing only those words that start with a capital letter. It does this by checking if the first character of each word is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function, which returns `true` if the first character is uppercase or `false` otherwise. If the condition is met, the word is pushed to the `names` array.\n\nYou can call this function with a list of words like so:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\nusing Test\n\n# Sample list of words\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"rat\", \"Duck\"]\n\n# Call the function and test the result\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\n@test names == [\"Cat\", \"Duck\"]\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nTest Passed\n```\n\nIf you want to ensure that the function works as expected with different types of inputs, you can write more comprehensive tests.","status":200,"tokens":[0,386],"elapsed":29.972651894,"_type":"aimessage"}]
