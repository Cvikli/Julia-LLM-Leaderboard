It does this by checking if the first character of each word is uppercase using the `isuppercase(c)` function, which returns a boolean indicating whether its argument is an uppercase letter. If it is, the word is added to the result vector using `push!`.\n\nYou can call this function with a list of words like so:\n\n```julia\nusing Test\n\n# Example words\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"apple\", \"Zebra\", \"mouse\"]\n\n# Filter out non-capitalized names\nnames_only = keep_only_names(words)\n\n@test names_only == [\"Cat\", \"Zebra\"]  # Expecting only \"Cat\" and \"Zebra\" to be capitalized\n```\n\nRemember to include the `Test` package if you want to write tests for your function.","status":200,"tokens":[68,360],"elapsed":27.917710859,"_type":"aimessage"}]
