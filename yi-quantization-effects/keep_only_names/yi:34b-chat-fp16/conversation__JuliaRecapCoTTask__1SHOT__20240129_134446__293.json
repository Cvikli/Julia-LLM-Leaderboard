[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Initialize an empty vector to store the filtered words\n    filtered_words = Vector{String}()\n    \n    # Iterate over each word in the list\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the first character of the word is uppercase\n        if isupper(word[1])\n            # If yes, add the word to the filtered list\n            push!(filtered_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\nThis function defines a `keep_only_names` function that takes in a vector of strings (`words`) and returns a new vector containing only those words that start with an uppercase letter. It does this by iterating over the input vector and checking if the first character of each word is uppercase using the `isupper` function. If it is, the word is added to the filtered list.\n\nTo double-check the solution:\n\n1. Ensure that the function type annotations are correct and general enough to cover a variety of inputs without being too restrictive. The use of `String` for the input and output types should be appropriate for this task.\n2. Test the function with various lists of words, including those that start with uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and mixed cases, to ensure that it filters as expected.\n3. Check for performance by profiling the function if necessary, especially if the list is very large. Ensure that the function is efficient in terms of memory and execution time.\n4. Verify that the function does not introduce any bugs or edge cases, such as handling words with non-letter characters or empty strings.\n5. Confirm that the function adheres to the special instructions provided by the user, if any.","status":200,"tokens":[11,393],"elapsed":30.665813422,"_type":"aimessage"}]
