The `ismatch` function is used to check if the regex matches the beginning of each word without consuming it, and `push!` is used to add matching words to the filtered list. Finally, the `println` function is used to print the original and filtered lists for demonstration purposes.","status":200,"tokens":[0,363],"elapsed":28.17156557,"_type":"aimessage"}]
