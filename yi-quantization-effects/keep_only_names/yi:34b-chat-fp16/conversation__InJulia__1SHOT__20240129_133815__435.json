Here's how you can define such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Initialize an empty array to store the filtered words\n    names = Vector{String}()\n\n    # Iterate over the list of words\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the word starts with a capital letter\n        if isuppercase(word[1])\n            # If yes, add it to the result array\n            push!(names, word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return names\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of words `words` and returns a new list containing only those words that start with a capital letter. The `isuppercase` function is used to check if the first character of each word is uppercase.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\nsome_words = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"apple\", \"Zebra\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(some_words)\nprintln(names)  # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Zebra\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, the `keep_only_names` function is applied to a list of words, and it returns a new list containing only \"Cat\" and \"Zebra\" because these are the only two words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,332],"elapsed":25.729224703,"_type":"aimessage"}]
