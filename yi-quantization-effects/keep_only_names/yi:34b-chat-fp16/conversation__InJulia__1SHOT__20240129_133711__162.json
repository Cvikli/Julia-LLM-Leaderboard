Here's how you can define such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Initialize an empty array to store the filtered words\n    names = Vector{String}()\n\n    # Iterate over the list of words\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the word starts with a capital letter\n        if ismatch(r\"^[A-Z]\", word)\n            # Add the word to the names array if it passes the check\n            push!(names, word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return names\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses `ismatch` from the `Regex` module to check if the first character of each word matches the pattern `[A-Z]` (a capital letter between A and Z). If the match is found, the word is added to the `names` array using `push!`. Finally, the `names` array is returned.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"apple\", \"Zebra\"]\nfiltered_names = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_names)  # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Zebra\"]\n```\n\nThis will print out the list of words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[68,332],"elapsed":25.749389755,"_type":"aimessage"}]
