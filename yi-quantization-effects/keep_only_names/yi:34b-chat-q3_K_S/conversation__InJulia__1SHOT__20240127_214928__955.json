The `startswith` function is used to check if a string starts with a substring, and `uppercasefirst` is used to ensure that we are comparing to the word's first character in its uppercase form.\n\nHere's how you would use this function:\n\n```julia\nusing Test\n@test keep_only_names([\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"dog\"]) == [\"Dog\"]\n```\n\nThis will pass the test, confirming that `keep_only_names` behaves as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[0,240],"elapsed":6.355215107,"_type":"aimessage"}]
