The `occsin()` function is used to match the first character of the word using a regular expression, which checks for Unicode uppercase characters. If you want to use ASCII letters only, you can replace this line with:\n\n```julia\nif startswith(word, 'A':'Z')\n```\n\nYou can call this function with your list of words like so:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"mouse\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output will be something like: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[68,346],"elapsed":9.32162777,"_type":"aimessage"}]
