If you want to handle non-alphabetic characters or internationalization concerns, you would need to adjust the predicate accordingly.\n\nYou can test the function like this:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"hat\", \"Batman\", \"fish\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words) # Should output: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Batman\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[68,321],"elapsed":8.677494635,"_type":"aimessage"}]
