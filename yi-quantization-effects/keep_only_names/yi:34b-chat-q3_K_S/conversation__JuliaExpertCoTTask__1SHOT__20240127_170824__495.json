The `uppercasefirst` function is used to convert the first character of both the input word and the alphabet string (\"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\") to upper case for comparison. This ensures that words like \"Apple\" are treated correctly since they start with a lowercase letter but should be kept because their first letter is uppercase when compared in this context.","status":200,"tokens":[0,202],"elapsed":5.365572177,"_type":"aimessage"}]
