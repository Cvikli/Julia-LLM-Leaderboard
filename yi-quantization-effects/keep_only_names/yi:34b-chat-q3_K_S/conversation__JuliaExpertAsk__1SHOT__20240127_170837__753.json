The `iscapitalized` function checks if the first character of a word is the same in both upper and lower case, indicating that it starts with a capital letter. The `uppercasefirst` function is used to convert the first character to upper case without affecting the rest of the string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,163],"elapsed":4.30623754,"_type":"aimessage"}]
