The `occursin(' ', w)` checks if there's a space in the word, which is used to catch cases where the first character isn't checked (like \"cat dog\"). The `isuppercasefirst(w)` checks if the first character of the word is uppercase.","status":200,"tokens":[0,142],"elapsed":3.751516607,"_type":"aimessage"}]
