[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    uppercase_words = filter(x -> ismatch(r\"^[A-Z]\", x), words) # Filter out non-capitalized words\n    return uppercase_words\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use `filter` to iteratively check each word in the list and keep only those that match the pattern `r\"^[A-Z]\"` which signifies a string starting with an uppercase letter.\n2. The regular expression `r\"^[A-Z]\"` uses a raw string literal to define the pattern, which simplifies writing regexes by preventing escape sequences from being interpreted as Julia code.\n3. The `ismatch` function is used within the filter to check if each word in the list matches the provided pattern. It returns `true` or `false` based on the match result.\n4. Finally, we return the filtered list of words that meet our criteria.","status":200,"tokens":[0,223],"elapsed":6.011963141,"_type":"aimessage"}]
