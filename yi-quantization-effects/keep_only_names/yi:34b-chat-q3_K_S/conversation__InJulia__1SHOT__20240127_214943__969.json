The `occsin` function is used to check if the first character of each word starts with 'A', which is equivalent to checking if it is uppercase in ASCII. If the first character is not 'A' or the word is not empty, the whole word is assumed to be non-capitalized and is filtered out.\n\nNote that this function assumes that all words are correctly split into a list of strings, which might require additional preprocessing if you have full sentences or paragraphs as input.","status":200,"tokens":[0,223],"elapsed":5.912500563,"_type":"aimessage"}]
