Below is a function in Julia that does this:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the filtered words\n    capitalized_words = []\n\n    # Iterate over each word in the original list\n    for word in words\n        # If the word starts with a capital letter, add it to the new list\n        if ismatch(r\"^[A-Z]\", word)\n            push!(capitalized_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return the new list of filtered words\n    return capitalized_words\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses `ismatch` from the built-in `Regex` module to check if a given word starts with a capital letter. If it does, it's added to the `capitalized_words` list using `push!`. Finally, the filtered list is returned.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\noriginal_words = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"apple\", \"Fish\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(original_words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Fish\"]\n```\n\nThis will print out the list of words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,304],"elapsed":8.361162293,"_type":"aimessage"}]
