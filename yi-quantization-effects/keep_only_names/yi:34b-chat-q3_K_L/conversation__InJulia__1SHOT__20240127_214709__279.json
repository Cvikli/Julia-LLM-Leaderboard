You can also use `uppercase` and `lowercase` to work with the upper- and lowercase of the letters. Here's how you can define the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Create an empty array to store the filtered words\n    capitalized_words = Vector{String}()\n    \n    # Iterate over each word in the list\n    for word in words\n        # If the first letter of the word is uppercase, add it to the result\n        if ismatch(r\"^[A-Z]\", word)\n            # Append the word to the result\n            push!(capitalized_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Return the filtered list of words\n    return capitalized_words\nend\n```\n\nLet's test the function with an example:\n\n```julia\nusing Test\n\n# Define some sample words\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"apple\", \"PEAR\", \"Fish\"]\n\n@testset \"Keep only names starting with a capital letter\" begin\n    # Call the function with our sample list of words\n    capitalized_names = keep_only_names(words)\n    \n    # Expect the function to return [\"Cat\", \"PEAR\", \"Fish\"]\n    @test capitalized_names == [\"Cat\", \"PEAR\", \"Fish\"]\nend\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `keep_only_names` that takes a list of words and returns a new list containing only those words that start with a capital letter. It uses a regular expression to match the beginning of each word with an uppercase letter, and then filters out the rest using `filter`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,432],"elapsed":11.925923855,"_type":"aimessage"}]
