[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Create an empty array to store the filtered words\n    filtered_words = Vector{String}()\n\n    # Iterate over each word in the list and check if it starts with a capital letter\n    for word in words\n        if word[1] == uppercase(word[1])  # Check if first character is uppercase\n            # If so, add it to the filtered list\n            push!(filtered_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a simple loop to iterate over each word in the `words` vector and checks if the first character is uppercase. If so, it adds the word to the `filtered_words` vector. After the loop, `filtered_words` contains all the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,202],"elapsed":5.629308775,"_type":"aimessage"}]
