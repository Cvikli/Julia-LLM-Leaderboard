Here's an example of how you might implement such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(w -> isuppercase(first(w)), words)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_words = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"tiger\"]\noutput_words = keep_only_names(input_words)\nprintln(output_words)  # Output will be: [\"Dog\", \"tiger\"]\n```\n\nThe `keep_only_names` function uses the `filter` function to iterate over the list of words and filter out those that do not start with a capital letter. The predicate function checks if the first character of each word is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function. If it's uppercase, the word is kept; otherwise, it's filtered out.\n\nNote that in Julia, strings are immutable and compare equal to their literal counterparts, so there's no need to use a case-insensitive comparison or string equality checking when filtering based on capitalization.","status":200,"tokens":[0,276],"elapsed":7.596463527,"_type":"aimessage"}]
