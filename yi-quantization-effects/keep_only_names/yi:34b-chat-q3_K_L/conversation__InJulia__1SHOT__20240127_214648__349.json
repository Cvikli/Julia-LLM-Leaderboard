If the condition is met, the word is added to the `kept_words` array, which is then returned as the result. The `first(word)` extracts the first character of the word, and `uppercase` converts it to upper case for comparison purposes.\n\nNote that this function assumes that each word is a valid English name where the capitalization pattern is as follows: All names should start with a capital letter, and the remaining letters are in lower case (unless they are proper nouns or part of a title). If you want to handle more complex cases (such as titles or proper names with specific capitalization rules), you would need to adjust the logic accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,372],"elapsed":10.257690021,"_type":"aimessage"}]
