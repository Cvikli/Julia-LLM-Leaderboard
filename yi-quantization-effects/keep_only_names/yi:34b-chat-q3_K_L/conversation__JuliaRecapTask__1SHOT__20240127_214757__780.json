[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    uppercasefirst = uppercasefirst.(words) # Apply `uppercasefirst` to each word in the list\n    return filter(word -> startswith(word, uppercasefirst(word)), words) # Filter out words that do not match their uppercased first character\nend\n```\n\nThe function works as follows:\n\n1. Use the `uppercasefirst` function to capitalize the first letter of each word in the list.\n2. Apply a filter over the original list of words, checking if each word starts with its uppercased first character using the `startswith` function.\n3. The filter only keeps words that match this condition, effectively removing all words that do not start with a capital letter.\n\nThis solution is efficient because it only iterates over the list once to capitalize and then filters based on the result, which is also an in-place operation without creating any unnecessary temporary arrays.","status":200,"tokens":[0,216],"elapsed":6.024026447,"_type":"aimessage"}]
