The `startswith` function is used to check if a string begins with the specified pattern, which in this case is any uppercase letter from 'A' to 'Z' (using the range operator `'A':'Z')`.\n\nYou can call this function and pass it a list of words:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"apple\", \"Fish\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Fish\"]\n```\n\nThis will print the list of filtered words. Note that the case sensitivity depends on the `case` argument in the `startswith` function; if you want to match both uppercase and lowercase letters, you would use `true` for the `case` argument:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # ... Code remains the same, but with a different case sensitivity in startswith\nend\n\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words; case=true)  # Case-insensitive filtering\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"apple\", \"Fish\"]\n```\n\nBy default, `startswith` is case-sensitive, but you can make it case-insensitive by setting the `case` argument to `true`.","status":200,"tokens":[68,521],"elapsed":14.563096479,"_type":"aimessage"}]
