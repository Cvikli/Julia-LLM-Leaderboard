Below is an example of how you can write a function in Julia to keep only names (words starting with a capital letter) in a list of words:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Initialize an empty array to store the filtered words\n    names = []\n\n    # Iterate over each word in the list\n    for w in words\n        # Check if the word starts with a capital letter\n        if ismatch(r\"^[A-Z]\", w)  # Regex match for uppercase characters\n            # Add the word to the names array if it passes the check\n            push!(names, w)\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return the filtered list of names\n    return names\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nwords = [\"dog\", \"cat\", \"Dog\", \"mouse\"]\nfiltered_names = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_names)  # Output: [\"Dog\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, `keep_only_names` function takes a list of words (`words`) and returns a new list containing only the names (words starting with a capital letter). It does this by iterating over each word in the list and using a regular expression to match if the word starts with an uppercase letter. If the match is found, the word is added to the `names` array, which is then returned at the end of the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,323],"elapsed":8.901493976,"_type":"aimessage"}]
