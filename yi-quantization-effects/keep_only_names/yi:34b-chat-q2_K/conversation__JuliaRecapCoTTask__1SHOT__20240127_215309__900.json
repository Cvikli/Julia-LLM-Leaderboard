[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    uppercase_letters = true  # Initialize a boolean for optimization\n    out_words = String[]  # Create an output array to store the filtered words\n    for word in words\n        if uppercase_letters && isuppercase(word[1])\n            push!(out_words, word)  # Append to output if both booleans are true\n        end\n        uppercase_letters = false  # Reset boolean after each iteration\n    elseif !isuppercase(word[1])  # If the first letter is not uppercase, skip this word\n            continue\n        end\n        uppercase_letters = true  # Set boolean to true if any lowercase letters encountered\n    end\n    return out_words\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a small optimization by initializing an `uppercase_letters` boolean and setting it to false after each iteration. This way, we only need to check for the first letter being uppercase during the loop when `uppercase_letters` is true. If any letter other than the first one is uppercase, we set `uppercase_letters` back to true immediately, skipping unnecessary checks for subsequent letters within the same word.","status":200,"tokens":[11,275],"elapsed":7.259997119,"_type":"aimessage"}]
