[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"## Recall Julia Snippets\n\nHere are some Julia code snippets that might be useful for solving the task:\n\n```julia\n# Defining a function with parameters and return type annotation\nfunction find_capitalized(words::Vector{String}) :: Vector{String}\n    # Body of the function goes here\nend\n\n# Check if a string starts with a capital letter\nfunction starts_with_cap(word::String) :: Bool\n    upcase_first = Dict('a' => 'A', 'b' => 'B', 'c' => 'C', ...) # Create an upcase dictionary for quick lookup\n    return word[1] in upcase_first && word[2:end] == \"\" || word[2:end] == \"\"\nend\n```\n\n## Solve the Task\n\nGiven the above snippets as a starting point, we can define `keep_only_names` as follows:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String}) :: Vector{String}\n    # Create an empty result vector\n    result = Vector{String}()\n    \n    for word in words\n        if starts_with_cap(word)\n            push!(result, word)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\n\nThis function iterates over the `words` vector and adds any word that starts with a capital letter to the resulting vector. Note that an empty string is considered to start with a capital letter for this purpose.\n\n## Double-check Solution\n\nTo ensure the solution is correct, we would need to test it with various input arrays of words and confirm that only the expected words are returned. For example:\n\n```julia\n# Test cases\nwords = [\"dog\", \"cat\", \"Hat\", \"hat\"]  # Should return [\"dog\", \"cat\", \"Hat\"]\nwords = [\"apple\", \"APPLE\", \"banana\"] # Should return [\"apple\", \"APPLE\"]\n```\n\n## Special Instructions\n\nIf the user provides any special instructions, we would need to incorporate those into our function definition or test cases. For example:\n\n- If the user specifies that `words` should be sorted in ascending order after capitalization, the function might need to be updated accordingly.\n- If the user provides specific values for `words`, we would include tests with those exact inputs and expected outputs.","status":200,"tokens":[11,549],"elapsed":14.426953823,"_type":"aimessage"}]
