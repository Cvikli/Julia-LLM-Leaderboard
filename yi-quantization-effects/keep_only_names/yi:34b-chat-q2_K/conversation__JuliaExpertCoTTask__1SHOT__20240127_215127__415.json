The input `words` is a list of strings.\n2. We need to remove all words that do not start with a capital letter.\n3. To check if a word starts with a capital letter, we can use `uppercasefirst(word)` to convert the first character to upper case and then compare it with the original word.\n4. The `filter` function is perfect for this as it allows us to filter out elements of a collection based on a predicate function. In our case, the predicate is `word -> word[1] == uppercasefirst(word)[1]` which checks if the first character of the word is equal to its uppercased version after converting back to lower case.\n5. The resulting array will contain all words that passed the filter, i.e., those that start with a capital letter.\n\nNow let's test the function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))  # Should output: [\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\nThis function is case-sensitive; therefore, \"dog\" will be filtered out because it does not start with a capital letter as per the requirements of the task.","status":200,"tokens":[0,367],"elapsed":9.474338528,"_type":"aimessage"}]
