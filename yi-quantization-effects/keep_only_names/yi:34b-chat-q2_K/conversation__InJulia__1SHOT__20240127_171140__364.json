If your input contains uppercase words that do not start with a capital letter, you will need to define what you mean by \"capital letter\" (e.g., whether you want to convert the entire word to lowercase or just the first letter) and adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,299],"elapsed":7.644717439,"_type":"aimessage"}]
