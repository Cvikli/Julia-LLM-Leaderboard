[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    uppercase = isempty(words) || !islowercase(first(words))\n    return join(filter(w -> uppercase == uppercase || lowercase(w) == w, words), \" \")\nend\n```\n\nThis function assumes that the `words` parameter is a string containing space-separated words. It first checks if the first word starts with a capital letter or not using `islowercase(first(words))`. If it does not start with a capital letter, then all subsequent words must also be checked for their first letter being uppercase or not.\n\nThe `filter` function is used to filter out any non-capitalized words from the original list of words. The predicate function checks if each word starts with an uppercase letter (using `uppercase`) or if it does not start with a capital letter but should be kept anyway (`lowerkey(w) == w`). This latter condition ensures that even if a word does not start with a capital letter, it is included in the result if it is already all lowercase.\n\nFinally, `join` is used to concatenate the filtered words into a single string, separated by spaces.","status":200,"tokens":[0,267],"elapsed":6.941148609,"_type":"aimessage"}]
