[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    selected_words = String[]\n    for word in words\n        if word[1] == uppercasefirst(word)[1]\n            push!(selected_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return selected_words\nend\n```\n\nLet's break down the solution:\n\n- We define a function `keep_only_names` that takes in a list of words (`words`).\n- Inside the function, we create an empty array called `selected_words` to store the filtered list.\n- We iterate over each word using `word in words`.\n- To check if a word should be kept, we use `uppercasefirst(word)` to convert the first letter of the word to uppercase and then compare it with the original word's first character. If they are equal, we append the word to the selected list (`push!(selected_words, word)`).\n- Finally, we return the selected list `selected_words`.\n\nTo double-check the solution:\n\n- The function correctly filters out words that do not start with a capital letter based on the user's instructions.\n- It does not rely on external packages or complex data structures, keeping the solution simple and efficient for small to medium-sized lists of words.\n\nRemember, this function assumes that all provided `words` are lowercase if they do not start with a capital letter. If you need to handle uppercase letters in the middle of words, you would need to adjust the logic accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,340],"elapsed":8.873206439,"_type":"aimessage"}]
