Here's how you can define such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Define a predicate function to check if a word starts with an uppercase letter\n    is_name = x -> startswith(x, uppercase(first(x)))\n    # Use filter to keep only the names that satisfy the predicate\n    return filter(is_name, words)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nnames = [\"dog\", \"cat\", \"Mouse\", \"Cow\"]\ncleaned_names = keep_only_names(names)\nprintln(cleaned_names)  # Output will be: [\"Mouse\", \"Cow\"]\n```\n\nIn the `is_name` function, we use `startswith` to check if a word starts with an uppercase letter. The `uppercase(first(x))` part converts the first character of each word to uppercase before comparing it.\n\nThe `filter` function applies this predicate to each element in the list and keeps only those elements for which the predicate returns `true`. The result is a new vector with only the names that start with an uppercase letter.","status":200,"tokens":[68,304],"elapsed":9.804353599,"_type":"aimessage"}]
