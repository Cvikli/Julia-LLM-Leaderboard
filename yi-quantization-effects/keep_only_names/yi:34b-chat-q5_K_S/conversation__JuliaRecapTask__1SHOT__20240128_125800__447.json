[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String}) :: Vector{String}\n    # Initialize an empty vector to hold the filtered words\n    kept_words = Vector{String}()\n\n    # Iterate over each word in the list\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the first character of the word is uppercase\n        if startswith(word, uppercase(word[1]))\n            # If yes, append the word to the kept_words vector\n            push!(kept_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return kept_words\nend\n```\n\nThis function defines a `Vector` of `String`s called `kept_words` and iterates over the provided list of words (`words`). For each word, it checks if the first character is uppercase by comparing the uppercased first character with the original string. If the condition is met, the word is appended to the `kept_words` vector. Finally, the function returns the `Vector` of filtered words.","status":200,"tokens":[0,233],"elapsed":7.479328047,"_type":"aimessage"}]
