Here's how you can define the `keep_only_names` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Create an empty array to store the names that start with a capital letter\n    capitalized_names = Array{String, 1}()\n\n    # Iterate over each word in the list\n    for word in words\n        # If the first character of the word is uppercase\n        if isupper(word[1])\n            # Push the word to the array of capitalized names\n            push!(capitalized_names, word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return capitalized_names\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of words `words` and returns an array of strings containing only those words that start with a capital letter. It uses the `isupper` function to check if the first character of each word is uppercase, and then it adds the word to the `capitalized_names` array if the condition is met.\n\nYou can call this function and pass any list of strings as follows:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"apple\", \"Zebra\", \"Fish\"]\ncapitalized_names = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(capitalized_names) # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Zebra\", \"Fish\"]\n```\n\nThis will print out the list of words that were kept because they started with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,370],"elapsed":11.75150871,"_type":"aimessage"}]
