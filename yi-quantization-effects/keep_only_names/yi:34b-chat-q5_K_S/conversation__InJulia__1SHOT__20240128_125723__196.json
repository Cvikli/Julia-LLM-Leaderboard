If it does, it is considered a \"name\" and added to the list of valid words using `push!`. The `uppercasefirst` function is used to ensure that we are comparing with the word itself, capitalized.\n\nTo use this function, simply pass a list of words as an argument:\n\n```julia\njulia> keep_only_names([\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Mouse\"])\n4-element Vector{String}:\n \"Dog\"\n \"cat\"\n \"Mouse\"\n```\n\nThe returned vector contains only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,262],"elapsed":8.291826051,"_type":"aimessage"}]
