Here's how you can define such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Initialize an empty array to store the names\n    names = Array{String, 1}()\n\n    # Iterate over the list of words\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the word starts with a capital letter\n        if isuppercase(first(word))\n            # If yes, add it to the array of names\n            push!(names, word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return names\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes an Array of strings `words` and returns an Array containing only the words that start with a capital letter. The `isuppercase(first(word))` checks if the first character of the word is uppercase, and `push!(names, word)` adds the word to the `names` array if it passes the check.\n\nYou can test this function as follows:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"mouse\", \"Mango\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names)  # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Mango\"]\n```\n\nThis will print the array of names that were kept after removing `\"dog\"` and `\"mouse\"` because they do not start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,337],"elapsed":9.713719755,"_type":"aimessage"}]
