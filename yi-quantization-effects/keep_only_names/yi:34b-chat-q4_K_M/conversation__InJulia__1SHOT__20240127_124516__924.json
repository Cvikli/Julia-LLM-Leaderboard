If it is, we add the word to a new list. The `[` and `]` around the parameter `words` in the function definition indicate that it's a vector (list) of strings.\n\nRemember to import the `Printf` module if you want to use `println`:\n\n```julia\nusing Printf\n```\n\nThis will allow you to print output to the console using `println(\"Your message\")`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,325],"elapsed":9.174087589,"_type":"aimessage"}]
