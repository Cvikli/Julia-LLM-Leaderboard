If it does, it's considered a \"name\" and is added to the resulting list.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"fish\", \"Fish\", \"bird\"]\ncapitalized_names = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(capitalized_names)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Fish\"]\n```\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that all words are separated by spaces. If the input is a single string with multiple words, you would need to split it first before passing it to the `keep_only_names` function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,344],"elapsed":9.720084272,"_type":"aimessage"}]
