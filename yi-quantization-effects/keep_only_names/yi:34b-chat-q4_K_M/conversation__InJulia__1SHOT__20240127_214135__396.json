The `Vector{String}()` is used to create an empty array that will hold the filtered words, and `push!` is used to add words to this array after passing the check.\n\nYou can use it as follows:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"mouse\", \"Fish\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Fish\"]\n```\n\nNote that this function does not modify the original list `words`; it returns a new filtered list.","status":200,"tokens":[0,340],"elapsed":9.625798935,"_type":"aimessage"}]
