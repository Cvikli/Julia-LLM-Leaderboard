The `first()` function is used to get the first character of each word, and `isuppercase()` checks if it's uppercase or not.\n\nWhen you run this code, you will see the following output:\n\n```\n[\"Cat\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\n\nOnly the words \"Cat\" and \"Elephant\" are left in the filtered list because they are the only ones that start with a capital letter. The other words (\"dog\", \"mouse\", \"apple\") are not included in the output.","status":200,"tokens":[0,277],"elapsed":7.835995431,"_type":"aimessage"}]
