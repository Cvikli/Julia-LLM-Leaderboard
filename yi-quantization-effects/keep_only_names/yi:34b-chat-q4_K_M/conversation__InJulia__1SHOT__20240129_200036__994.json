It then iterates over each word and checks if the first character is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function. If it is, the word is added to a new vector called `new_words`. Finally, the `new_words` vector is returned as the filtered list of words.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output will be: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```\n\nThis will print out the filtered list of words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,335],"elapsed":9.670644685,"_type":"aimessage"}]
