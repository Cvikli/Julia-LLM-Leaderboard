In this case, the pattern is `^[A-Z]`, which means it starts with an uppercase letter between A and Z. If the word matches this pattern, it is added to the `capitalized_words` vector using `push!`. Finally, the filtered list is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,220],"elapsed":6.33654596,"_type":"aimessage"}]
