The `ismatch` function checks if the pattern matches the beginning of the word. If it does, the word is added to a new list. Finally, the new list is returned.\n\nTo use this function, simply call it with your list of words:\n\n```julia\nusing Test\n\n# Example words list\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"apple\", \"Zebra\", \"toy\"]\ncapitalized_words = keep_only_names(words)\n\n@test capitalized_words == [\"Cat\", \"Zebra\"]\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nTest Passed\n```\n\nIf you want to include words that are entirely uppercase (like acronyms or initialisms), you can modify the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,344],"elapsed":9.955967252,"_type":"aimessage"}]
