If it is, the word is added to a new array using `push!`. The original list is not modified; instead, a new array containing only the words that start with a capital letter is returned.\n\nYou can test this function like so:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"mouse\", \"Milk\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Milk\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,294],"elapsed":8.466443003,"_type":"aimessage"}]
