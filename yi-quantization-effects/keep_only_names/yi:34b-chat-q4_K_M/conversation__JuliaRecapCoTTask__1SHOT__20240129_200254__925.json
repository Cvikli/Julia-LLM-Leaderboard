[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Given the task description and the special instructions, here is a function `keep_only_names` that meets the requirements:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Initialize an empty vector to store the filtered words\n    filtered_words = Vector{String}()\n    \n    for word in words\n        # Check if the word starts with a capital letter\n        if isuppercase(word[1])\n            # If yes, add it to the filtered list\n            push!(filtered_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\nThis function iterates over the `words` vector and uses the `isuppercase` function to check if the first letter of each word is uppercase. If it is, the word is added to the `filtered_words` vector. Finally, the `filtered_words` vector is returned as the result.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that all words are separated by spaces and that each word does not contain any punctuation or special characters. If the input contains such elements, they should be removed or handled before passing the list to this function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,261],"elapsed":7.6784404,"_type":"aimessage"}]
