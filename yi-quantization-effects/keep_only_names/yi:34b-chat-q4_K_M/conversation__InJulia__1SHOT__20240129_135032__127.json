Here's how you can define such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(word -> occursin(r\"^[A-Z]\", word), words)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses `occursin` to check if the regular expression `r\"^[A-Z]\"` is present in the word. The regular expression `^[A-Z]` matches if the first character of the string is a capital letter from A to Z. If it does, the word is kept; otherwise, it is removed.\n\nYou can test this function as follows:\n\n```julia\njulia> keep_only_names([\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\"])\n2-element Vector{String}:\n \"Dog\"\n \"Cat\"\n```\n\nThe `keep_only_names` function returns a vector containing only the names that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,258],"elapsed":7.434526555,"_type":"aimessage"}]
