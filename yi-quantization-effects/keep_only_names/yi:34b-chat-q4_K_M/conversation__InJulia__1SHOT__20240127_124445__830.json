If the function returns `true`, the word is added to the new array of filtered words.\n\nTo use this function, you would simply call it with your list of words:\n\n```julia\nusing Test\n\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\n@test filtered_words == [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```\n\nThis will assert that the `filtered_words` array contains only the capitalized words from the original list.","status":200,"tokens":[68,286],"elapsed":8.227750389,"_type":"aimessage"}]
