The regex `^` signifies the start of the string, and `[A-Z]` matches any single character in the range A-Z. If the match is found, the word is added to the `names` array using `push!`.\n\nThe function returns an array containing only the names that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,327],"elapsed":9.425813859,"_type":"aimessage"}]
