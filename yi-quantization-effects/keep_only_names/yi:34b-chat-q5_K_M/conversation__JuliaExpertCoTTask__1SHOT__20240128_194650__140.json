The predicate function checks if the word starts with its uppercase version by using the `startswith` function and comparing it with the result of `uppercasefirst`, which converts the first character of the word to uppercase.","status":200,"tokens":[0,184],"elapsed":5.998438079,"_type":"aimessage"}]
