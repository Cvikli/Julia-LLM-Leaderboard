If all these conditions are met, the word is added to the new list of capitalized words.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\njulia> keep_only_names([\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"tiger\"])\n4-element Vector{String}:\n \"Dog\"\n \"Cat\"\n \"tiger\"\n \"dog\"\n```\n\nNotice that in the output, the lowercase word \"dog\" is still present because it does not start with a capital letter. The function only removes words where the first character should be uppercase but isn't (like \"dog\").","status":200,"tokens":[0,371],"elapsed":12.069028339,"_type":"aimessage"}]
