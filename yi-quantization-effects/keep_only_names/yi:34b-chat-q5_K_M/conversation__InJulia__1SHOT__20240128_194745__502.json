If it does, it is considered a name and added to the new list. Otherwise, it is skipped.\n\nUsing `filter` and `startswith` allows for a more compact and efficient solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Using filter with startswith\n    return filter(word -> startswith(uppercasefirst(word), word), words)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nfiltered_names = keep_only_names(names)\nprintln(\"Filtered names:\", filtered_names)\n```\n\nThis version uses `filter` to create a new collection by applying a predicate function to each element of the old collection and including in the new collection only those elements for which the predicate returns a truthy value. The predicate is `startswith(uppercasefirst(word), word)`, which checks if the uppercased first character of the word matches the first character of the word itself.\n\nBoth versions will output:\n\n```\nFiltered names: [\"Cat\", \"Mouse\", \"Bat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,440],"elapsed":14.344625962,"_type":"aimessage"}]
