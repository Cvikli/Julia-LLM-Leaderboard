It does this by iterating over each word, converting the first character to uppercase, and checking if the word starts with that uppercased character using `isstartswith`. If it does, the word is added to the `names` list, which is then returned at the end of the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,221],"elapsed":7.180333273,"_type":"aimessage"}]
