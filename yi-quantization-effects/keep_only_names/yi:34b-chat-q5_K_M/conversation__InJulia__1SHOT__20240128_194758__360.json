Here's how you can define such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the names\n    names = []\n    # Iterate over each word in the list\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the word starts with a capital letter\n        if isstartswith(word, uppercase(word[1]))\n            # If yes, add it to the list of names\n            push!(names, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return names\nend\n```\n\nThis function defines a `keep_only_names` function that takes in a list of words (`words`) and returns a new list containing only those words that start with a capital letter. The `isstartswith` function is used to check if the word starts with the first character in uppercase, and `push!` is used to add the word to the result list if it passes the test.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"fish\", \"Frog\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names) # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Frog\"]\n```\n\nPlease note that the `keep_only_names` function assumes that all names are written with a capital letter and subsequent letters in lowercase. If you have a more complex case where names can have various formats (e.g., \"Dog\", \"dog\"), you might need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,392],"elapsed":12.769886127,"_type":"aimessage"}]
