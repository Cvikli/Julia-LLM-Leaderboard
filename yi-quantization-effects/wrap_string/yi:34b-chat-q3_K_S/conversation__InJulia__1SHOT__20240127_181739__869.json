It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can define the `wrap_string` function like so:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String; text_width::Int=10)\n    lines = []\n    current_line = \"\"\n    for word in split(text)\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) <= text_width\n            current_line *= \"$word \"\n        else\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        end\n        while true\n            if length(current_line) > text_width || endswith(current_line, '\\n')\n                push!(lines, current_line)\n                current_line = \"\"\n            else\n                break\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\") * \"\\n\"  # Join the lines with a newline character and append an extra newline at the end\nend\n```\n\nThis function will iterate over each word in `text` and wrap it to a new line if the current line length plus the word length exceeds `text_width`. It also accounts for the last word of each line, ensuring that it is not split across lines.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"Hello there this is some text that might be longer than the allowed width\"\nprint(wrap_string(text))  # Print the wrapped string with newlines added between each line\n```\n\nOutput will look something like this, depending on the width of your terminal:\n\n```\nHello there\nthis is some text\nthat might be longer\nthan the allowed width\n```\n\nRemember that the `wrap_string` function adds a trailing newline character to its result by default. If you want to strip this off (which would be consistent with the behavior of similar functions in other languages), remove the last line from the definition of `wrap_string`:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String; text_width::Int=10)\n    # ... The function body here is the same as above ...\nend\n```\n\nThen use it like this:\n\n```julia\nprint(wrap_string(text, text_width=80))  # Print the wrapped string with newlines added between each line\n```\n\nThe output will not have an extra newline at the end.","status":200,"tokens":[0,538],"elapsed":14.327989005,"_type":"aimessage"}]
