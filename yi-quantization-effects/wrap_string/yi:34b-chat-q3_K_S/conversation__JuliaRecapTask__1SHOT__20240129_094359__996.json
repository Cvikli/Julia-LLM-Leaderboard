[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

It then iterates over these words, appending each word to a \"current line\" until the length of the current line plus the next word exceeds the specified `text_width`. When this happens, it adds the current line to an output vector and starts a new line for the next word.\n\nThe function also handles the case where there are no spaces in the text by appending each character to the current line until the length of the current line exceeds `text_width`.\n\nFinally, the function returns a vector of strings, where each string represents a wrapped line from the original text.\n\n## Example\n\n```julia\njulia> wrap_string(\"Hello World! This is a very long sentence that will be wrapped at 10 characters per line.\")\n5-element Vector{String}:\n \"Hello World!\"\n \"This is a ve\"\n \"ry long sen\"\n \"tence that w\"\n \"ill be wrap\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,551],"elapsed":15.554693632,"_type":"aimessage"}]
