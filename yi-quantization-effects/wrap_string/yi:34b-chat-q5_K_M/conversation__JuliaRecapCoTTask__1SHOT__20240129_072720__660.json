[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded.

The maximum line length is set to 10 characters.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(text))\n# Output:\n# This is a very long\n# sentence that should\n# be wrapped into\n# multiple lines. The\n# maximum line length\n# is set to 10\n# characters.\n```\n\nIn this function, we iterate over the words in the text and append each word to an array of lines. We check before appending each word whether adding it would exceed the specified `text_width`. If so, we add a new line to the array and start a new line for the next word. After iterating over all words, we join the lines with newline characters to create the final wrapped string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,278],"elapsed":9.179358385,"_type":"aimessage"}]
