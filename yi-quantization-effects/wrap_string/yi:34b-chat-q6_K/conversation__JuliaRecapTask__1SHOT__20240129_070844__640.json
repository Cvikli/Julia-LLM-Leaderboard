[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

It keeps track of the current line using a variable `current_line`. Each time a word would make the current line longer than the specified `text_width`, a new line is started. The final result is a list of lines that are joined with a newline character.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\njulia> wrap_string(\"Hello world. This is a very long string that should be wrapped at 10 characters per line.\")\n\"Hello world.\\nThis is a very\\nlong string that\\nshould be wrapped\\nat 10 characters per line.\"\n```\n\nIn this example, the text is wrapped at each space after the 9th character (to account for the space at the beginning of the next word), resulting in four lines with 10 characters each except for the last one, which has fewer due to the lack of a full word.","status":200,"tokens":[376,345],"elapsed":21.098931869,"_type":"aimessage"}]
