X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

We might also use `for` loops or `eachindex` to iterate over the text and words.\n\nNow, let's solve the task:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString; text_width::Int=10)\n    # Step 1: Split the text into an array of words\n    words = split(text)\n\n    # Step 2: Initialize an empty string to accumulate wrapped lines\n    wrapped_lines = \"\"\n\n    # Step 3: Iterate over the words, appending each word to a line until the line length exceeds `text_width`\n    for (i, word) in enumerate(words)\n        if isempty(word) || i == 1 # If the word is empty or it's the first word\n            # Append it directly to the wrapped lines\n            append!(wrapped_lines, word)\n            continue\n        end\n\n        current_line = wrapped_lines * \" \"  # Prepend a space if we have a previous line\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) > text_width # Check if the line is too long\n            # If so, add a new line with the word and continue to next word\n            append!(wrapped_lines, \"\\n\" * word)\n            continue\n        end\n\n        # Append the word to the current line\n        append!(wrapped_lines, word)\n    end\n\n    # Step 4: Return the wrapped text\n    return wrapped_lines\nend\n```\n\nNext, let's implement a test case to double-check that our solution is correct:\n\n```julia\nusing Test\n\n@testset \"Wrap String\" begin\n    text = \"Hello there! This is a very long sentence that should be wrapped at 10 characters per line.\"\n    expected_output = \"Hello there!\\nThis is a very\\nlong sentence that\\nshould be wrapped\\nat 10 characters\\nper line.\"\n    actual_output = wrap_string(text)\n    @test actual_output == expected_output\nend\n```\n\nFinally, we can provide an example of how to use the `wrap_string` function:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\ntext = \"A long text that needs wrapping\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text)\nprintln(wrapped_text)  # Output: A long text that needs wrapping\n```\n\nThis solution assumes that the input string contains only spaces as separators between words. If other types of separators are possible, we would need to account for them in the `split` function or provide a more sophisticated approach to tokenizing the text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,738],"elapsed":27.821053276,"_type":"aimessage"}]
