Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can define a function `wrap_string` to wrap a string at a given text width by splitting the original string into parts and joining them with newline characters when necessary. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString; text_width::Int=10)\n    # Split the text into an array of words\n    lines = split(text)\n    wrapped_lines = Vector{String}() # Empty vector to store wrapped lines\n\n    for line in lines\n        if length(line) > text_width\n            # If a word is longer than the text width, add it as is\n            push!(wrapped_lines, line)\n        else\n            # Otherwise, accumulate words until the limit is reached or all words are added\n            acc = \"\"\n            for w in line\n                if length(acc) + length(w) <= text_width\n                    acc *= w * \" \"\n                else\n                    push!(wrapped_lines, acc)\n                    acc = \"\"\n                end\n            end\n            # Add the remaining words from this line\n            if acc â‰  \"\"\n                push!(wrapped_lines, acc)\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return join(wrapped_lines, \"\\n\") # Join wrapped lines with newline characters\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a `text::AbstractString` and an optional `text_width::Int`. It splits the text into words using `split` and then iterates over each word, adding them to a vector of strings. When a word exceeds the specified text width, it is added as a new line in the vector. Otherwise, it is appended to the current line being built.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\njulia> wrap_string(\"Hello there! This is a very long string that I want to wrap at 10 characters per line. It's quite a task, but I think my AI assistant will handle it just fine.","status":200,"tokens":[0,469],"elapsed":17.414182049,"_type":"aimessage"}]
