If a word cannot fit in the current line without exceeding `text_width`, the function will find the last space within `text_width` characters from the end of the current line and break the line there. If no space is found within `text_width` characters, it will break the word itself at `text_width` characters from the start of the word.","status":200,"tokens":[104,555],"elapsed":28.809713724,"_type":"aimessage"}]
