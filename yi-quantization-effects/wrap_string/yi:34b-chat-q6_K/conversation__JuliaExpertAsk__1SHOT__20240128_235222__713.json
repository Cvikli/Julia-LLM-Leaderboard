If you want to see how it wraps at a specific width, change the `text_width` value:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"A very long string that needs to be wrapped into multiple lines.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, text_width=20)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n# Output (assuming a width of 20):\n# [\"A very long string that\", \"needs to be wrapped into\", \"multiple lines.\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,343],"elapsed":12.724922251,"_type":"aimessage"}]
