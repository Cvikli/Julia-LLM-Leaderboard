[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded.

If a word is longer than or equal to the specified `text_width`, it is truncated and appended to the previous line, followed by a newline character. Otherwise, it is simply added to the current line. Finally, all the lines are joined back together with a newline character between them.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"Hello world this is a very long sentence that should be wrapped\"\nprintln(wrap_string(text))\n# Output:\n# Hello world this is a very long sentence\n# that should be wrapped\n```\n\nIn the above output, you can see that the sentence has been wrapped at each word that would cause the line to exceed 10 characters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,290],"elapsed":9.330530706,"_type":"aimessage"}]
