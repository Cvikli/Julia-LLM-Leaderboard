For each word, it checks if adding the word to the current line would exceed the specified `text_width`. If so, it starts a new line. Finally, it joins all the lines together with `\\n` as a separator to form the wrapped text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,247],"elapsed":7.902491146,"_type":"aimessage"}]
