[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded.

It handles cases where a word is too long to fit on a single line or if it starts with a space (which should always start a new line). It also wraps the text at the specified `text_width`, ensuring that each line does not exceed that width.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\njulia> wrap_string(\"Hello world this is a very long string for testing purposes\")\n10-element Vector{String}:\n \"Hello world\"\n \"this is a\"\n \"very long\"\n \"string for\"\n \"testing pur\"\n \"poses\"\n```\n\nIn this example, the text is wrapped at each space that would result in a line longer than 10 characters. The first word (\"Hello world\") fits on one line because it's less than 10 characters long. The second and third words are appended to the same line since they fit within the remaining width of the line after \"Hello world\". The fourth word (\"string\") starts a new line because the combined length with the previous line exceeds 10 characters. The rest of the text is wrapped accordingly.\n\nPlease note that this implementation does not handle edge cases such as extremely long lines that would require multiple wraps or very short lines that could be merged for better readability. It also assumes that the input string contains only printable characters (no control characters) and that words are separated by spaces, which is a common assumption for text processing in natural languages.","status":200,"tokens":[0,573],"elapsed":18.527526503,"_type":"aimessage"}]
