Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can define a function `wrap_string` that splits the input string into words and wraps them to fit within the specified text width. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString; text_width::Int=10)\n    # Split the text into lines based on newline characters\n    lines = split(text, '\\n')\n    \n    # Iterate over each line and wrap it if necessary\n    for (i, line) in enumerate(lines)\n        # If the line is empty or only contains whitespace, continue\n        if isempty(line) || all(iswhitespace, line)\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        # Split the current line into words\n        words = split(line)\n        \n        # Check if wrapping is needed for this line\n        if length(words) > text_width\n            # Create an empty string to accumulate the wrapped line\n            accumulated_line = \"\"\n            \n            # Loop over each word and add it to the accumulated line\n            for word in words\n                # If adding the current word would exceed the text width, start a new line\n                if length(accumulated_line) + length(word) > text_width\n                    # Add a new line and the word to the output\n                    lines[i] = accumulated_line * \"\\n\" * word\n                    accumulated_line = \"\"\n                else\n                    # Append the word to the accumulated_line\n                    accumulated_line = accumulated_line * ' ' * word\n                end\n            end\n            \n            # If there's anything left in the accumulated_line, add it to the output\n            if length(accumulated_line) > 0\n                lines[i] = accumulated_line\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Join the lines back together with newline characters\n    return join(lines, '\\n')\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ntext = \"Hello there this is a very long sentence that should be wrapped to fit within the text width\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nThis function will output the text with line breaks added where necessary to ensure that each line does not exceed `text_width` characters. In the example above, if `text_width` is set to 10, the sentence will be wrapped accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,550],"elapsed":17.517268435,"_type":"aimessage"}]
