It appends each word to the current line until the line length exceeds `text_width`. When this happens, it starts a new line and continues with the next word. Finally, it joins all the lines back together with a newline character between them.","status":200,"tokens":[104,239],"elapsed":13.741433119,"_type":"aimessage"}]
