[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

The `wrap_words` function works by maintaining an \"output\" vector of words that are being constructed while ensuring they don't exceed the specified width.\n\n**Example usage:**\n\n```julia\ntext = \"Hello this is a very long string that needs to be wrapped into multiple lines.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n# Output:\n# Hello this is a very long string that needs\n# to be wrapped into multiple lines.\n```\n\n**Double-checking:**\n\nThe `wrap_string` function ensures that each line does not exceed the specified `text_width` by splitting words and appending them to the output buffer with newline characters between each line. The `wrap_words` function is recursive, ensuring that it can handle arbitrarily long lines by breaking down the text into smaller parts and reassembling them in a way that respects the width constraint.\n\nThe solution prioritizes clarity and readability over performance optimizations since the problem does not involve high-performance requirements or large datasets. The usage example provided demonstrates how the function works as expected, wrapping the text at the specified width.","status":200,"tokens":[0,786],"elapsed":25.463263501,"_type":"aimessage"}]
