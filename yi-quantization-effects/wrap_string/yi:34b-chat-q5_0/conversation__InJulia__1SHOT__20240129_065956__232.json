Below is an example of how you could write the `wrap_string` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String; text_width::Int = 10)\n    lines = []\n    current_line = \"\"\n    for word in split(text)\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) > text_width\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = \"\"\n        end\n        current_line *= \"$word \"\n    end\n    push!(lines, current_line)  # Add the last line if it's not empty\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ntext = \"This is a very long string that should be wrapped into multiple lines.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, text_width=20)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nThis function splits the input `String` into words using `split()` and then iterates over them. For each word, it checks if adding the word to the current line would exceed the maximum `text_width`. If so, it appends the current line to the list of lines and starts a new one. After processing all words, it joins the lines back together with newline characters between them.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the text is composed of spaces as word separators. It may not handle other types of whitespace or complex formatting correctly. Additionally, the line wrapping behavior is quite basic and doesn't account for things like hyphenation or special handling of words that are exactly `text_width` characters wide.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to call the `wrap_string` function with an example text and prints the wrapped result to the console.","status":200,"tokens":[0,399],"elapsed":12.658942058,"_type":"aimessage"}]
