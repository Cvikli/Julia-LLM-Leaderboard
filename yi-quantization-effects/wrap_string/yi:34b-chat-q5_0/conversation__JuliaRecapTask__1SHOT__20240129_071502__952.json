[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

If so, it appends the current line to the lines vector and advances the start of the next line. After the loop, it concatenates all the lines together with newline characters between them.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\njulia> text = \"Hello there! This is a very long sentence that will be wrapped into multiple lines.\"\n\"Hello there! This is a very long sentence that will be wrapped into multiple lines.\"\n\njulia> wrap_string(text)\n\"Hello there!\\nThis is a very long sentence that will be wrapped into multiple lines.\"\n```\n\nIn this example, the text \"Hello there!\" does not exceed `text_width`, so it's included in the first line without a newline. The rest of the sentence exceeds `text_width` and is wrapped accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,507],"elapsed":16.393440937,"_type":"aimessage"}]
