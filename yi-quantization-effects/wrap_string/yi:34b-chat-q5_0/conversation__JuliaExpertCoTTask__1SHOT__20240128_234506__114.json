This function removes the first character of the word and continues until either the word is shorter than the width or there's no more word left to process. The actual implementation of this function could be improved by taking into account edge cases such as empty lines or very long words that never fit within the specified width.","status":200,"tokens":[0,411],"elapsed":13.126948595,"_type":"aimessage"}]
