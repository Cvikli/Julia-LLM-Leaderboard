Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can define a function `wrap_string` to wrap the text of a string into multiple lines based on a specified width. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String; text_width::Int=10)\n    lines = []\n    for word in split(text)\n        if length(word) + sum(length(l) for l in lines) > text_width\n            push!(lines, \"\")\n        end\n        push!(lines, word)\n    end\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ntext = \"This is a very long string that I want to wrap into multiple lines.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nThis function splits the text into words using `split`, then iterates over each word. For each word, it checks if adding it to the current line would exceed the specified `text_width`. If so, a new line is started. After all words are processed, the resulting lines are joined with `\\n` characters to form the wrapped text.\n\nPlease note that this function does not perform full-fledged word wrapping, which might involve more complex tasks like hyphenation and handling of special cases (like URLs or email addresses). It's a simple line-based wrapper that respects the specified width.","status":200,"tokens":[0,319],"elapsed":10.107982055,"_type":"aimessage"}]
