[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

For each word, it checks if adding it to the current line would exceed the maximum width. If so, a new line is started. The `join` function is used to concatenate all lines with spaces in between, and finally, the resulting string is returned with newline characters between each line.\n\nHere's an example of how to use this function:\n\n```julia\njulia> wrap_string(\"Hello there! How are you today? It's been a while since we last talked. I hope everything is well.\")\n\"Hello there!\\nHow are you today?\\nIt's been a while since we last talked.\\nI hope everything is well.\"\n```\n\nIn this example, the text is wrapped at 10 characters per line, as specified by the `text_width` parameter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,412],"elapsed":13.29018246,"_type":"aimessage"}]
