Below is a definition of the `wrap_string` function in Julia that wraps text at a specified width (defaulting to 10 characters per line), and an example usage:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String; text_width::Int=10)\n    lines = []\n    current_line = \"\"\n    for word in split(text)\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) > text_width\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = \"\"\n        end\n        current_line *= \"$word \"\n    end\n    if current_line != \"\"\n        push!(lines, current_line)\n    end\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ntext = \"Hello there! This is a very long string that I want to wrap into multiple lines.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nThis function splits the text into words, and as it iterates over them, it appends each word to a current line. If the length of the current line plus the word exceeds the specified `text_width`, a newline is added, and the process continues with an empty current line. After all words have been processed, the function returns a string with the wrapped text, where each line is separated by a newline character (`\"\\n\"`).\n\nPlease note that this function does not perform any fancy word wrapping, such as handling hyphenation or breaking at syllable boundaries. It simply wraps on whitespace to ensure that each line does not exceed the specified width.","status":200,"tokens":[0,375],"elapsed":29.12170229,"_type":"aimessage"}]
