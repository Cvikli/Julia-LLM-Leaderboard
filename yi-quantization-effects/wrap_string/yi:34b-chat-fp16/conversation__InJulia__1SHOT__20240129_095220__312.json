Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can write a function to wrap a string at a specified text width by using a combination of `eachword` and `split` from the `TextParse` package. Below is an example of how you can define such a function:\n\n```julia\nusing TextParse\n\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString; text_width::Int=10)\n    words = eachword(text) |> collect\n    lines = Vector{String}()\n    current_line = \"\"\n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) > text_width\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = \"\"\n        end\n        current_line *= \" $word\"\n    end\n    if current_line != \"\"\n        push!(lines, current_line)\n    end\n    return lines\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ntext = \"This is a very long string that will be wrapped into multiple lines. The text width is set to 10 characters per line.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text; text_width=10)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nThis function iterates over each word in the text, and appends it to a current line. If the length of the current line plus the word exceeds `text_width`, a new line is started. After processing all words, the resulting array of lines is returned.\n\nPlease note that the `TextParse` package needs to be installed before you can use this function:\n\n```julia\n] add TextParse # inside a Julia REPL\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you don't want to use a package, you can define your own word-splitting logic using regular expressions or by splitting on whitespace characters. Here's an example without using `TextParse`:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString; text_width::Int=10)\n    lines = Vector{String}()\n    current_line = \"\"\n    for word in split(text)\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) > text_width\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = \"\"\n        end\n        current_line *= \" $word\"\n    end\n    if current_line != \"\"\n        push!(lines, current_line)\n    end\n    return lines\nend\n\n# Example usage: same as before\n```\n\nThis second implementation splits the text using whitespace characters and then iterates over each word, handling line wrapping in the same way.","status":200,"tokens":[0,590],"elapsed":45.850588596,"_type":"aimessage"}]
