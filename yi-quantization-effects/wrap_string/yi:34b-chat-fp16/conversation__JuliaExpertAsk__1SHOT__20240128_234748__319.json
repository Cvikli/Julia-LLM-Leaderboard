This is a very long sentence that should wrap.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, text_width=20)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nThis function splits the input text into words and iterates over them. It builds a new line by appending each word to the current line until the maximum width is reached. Once the limit is exceeded, it starts a new line and continues building from there. After processing all the words, it joins the lines back together with newline characters in between, creating a wrapped version of the original text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,265],"elapsed":20.527449355,"_type":"aimessage"}]
