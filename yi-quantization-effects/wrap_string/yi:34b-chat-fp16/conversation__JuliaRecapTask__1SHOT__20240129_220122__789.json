[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

If a word is longer than `text_width`, it is broken up into pieces that fit within the width, with each piece being followed by a new line. If a word is exactly `text_width` characters long or shorter, it is appended to the end of the last line (or added as a new line if there isn't one yet).\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\njulia> wrap_string(\"Hello world! This is a very long sentence that should be wrapped at 10 characters per line.\")\n\"Hello world!\\nThis is a very long\\nsentence that should be\\nwrapped at 10 characters\\nper line.\"\n```\n\nIn this example, the text is wrapped at every tenth character (excluding the space after \"world!\" and the period at the end of the sentence).","status":200,"tokens":[0,491],"elapsed":38.38945155,"_type":"aimessage"}]
