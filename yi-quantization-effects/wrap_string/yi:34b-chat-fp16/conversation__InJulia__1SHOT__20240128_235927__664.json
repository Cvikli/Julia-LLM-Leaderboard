Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can write a function `wrap_string` that splits a string into lines based on the specified maximum text width. Here's how you can define the function and provide an example of its use:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString; text_width::Int=10)\n    lines = []\n    for word in split(text)\n        if length(word) + sum(length.(lines)) > text_width\n            push!(lines, \"\")\n        end\n        push!(lines, word)\n    end\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ntext = \"Hello there this is a very long sentence that should be wrapped into multiple lines based on the text width provided.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, text_width=80)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over the words in the string and appending them to a vector of lines. Each time the length of the current line (including the word) would exceed the `text_width`, a new line is added to the vector. After all words have been processed, the resulting vector of lines is joined with newline characters to create a multi-line string.\n\nPlease note that this function does not perform any kind of smart wrapping, such as inserting hyphens at word boundaries or handling text that might need to be wrapped differently (e.g., URLs, email addresses). It simply splits the text into lines based on the specified width.","status":200,"tokens":[0,344],"elapsed":26.671912164,"_type":"aimessage"}]
