[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

Each time a word would cause the current line to exceed the `text_width` limit, the line is added to the result, and the current line is reset. After all words have been processed, any remaining characters in the current line are also added to the result. The function then joins all the lines with newline characters to form a multi-line string.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"This is a very long sentence that will be wrapped into multiple lines.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nThis would output something like:\n\n```\nThis is a very\nlong sentence that\nwill be wrapped into\nmultiple lines.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,317],"elapsed":24.727542137,"_type":"aimessage"}]
