Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can define a function `wrap_string` that takes a string as input and wraps it at a specified width. The function should split the string into words and insert newlines when the total length of the line (including the word) exceeds the maximum text width. Here's how you can implement this:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString; text_width::Int=10)\n    # Split the text into a vector of words\n    lines = []\n    for word in split(text)\n        if length(word) + sum(length.(lines)) > text_width\n            push!(lines, \"\")\n        end\n        push!(lines, word)\n    end\n    # Join the words in each line and return as a vector of strings\n    return join.(lines, \" \")\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ntext = \"Hello there this is a very long string that should be wrapped at 10 characters per line\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, text_width=10)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output the wrapped text, with each line containing no more than `text_width` characters. Note that the function is designed to handle both ASCII and Unicode strings.\n\nThis function works by iterating over the words in the string and appending them to a vector of lines. Each time a word is added, the total length of the line is checked against the maximum text width. If adding the word would exceed the width, a new line is started. After all words have been processed, the function joins each line with spaces and returns a vector of strings, one for each wrapped line.","status":200,"tokens":[0,381],"elapsed":29.537717505,"_type":"aimessage"}]
