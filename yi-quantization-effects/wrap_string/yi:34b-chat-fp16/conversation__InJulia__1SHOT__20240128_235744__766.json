Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can write a function that wraps a string to fit within a specified width by using `\\n` characters to insert line breaks. Here's how you can define the `wrap_string` function and an example of its usage:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String; text_width::Int=10)\n    lines = []\n    for word in split(text)\n        if length(word) + length(join(lines, \"\")) > text_width\n            push!(lines, \"\")\n        end\n        push!(lines, word)\n    end\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ntext = \"A very long string that should be wrapped to fit within 10 characters per line.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nThis function splits the text into words using `split`, and then iterates over those words. At each word, it checks if the total length of the current line (including the new word) would exceed the specified `text_width`. If so, it adds an empty string to the list of lines to indicate a line break. Finally, it joins all the lines back together with `\\n` characters between them and returns the wrapped text.\n\nPlease note that this function does not handle edge cases like very long words that cannot be split or adjust for punctuation. It's also worth mentioning that this is a simple implementation and more sophisticated text wrapping algorithms might take into account things like word boundaries, hyphenation, and the presence of punctuation to ensure better readability.","status":200,"tokens":[0,364],"elapsed":28.234151649,"_type":"aimessage"}]
