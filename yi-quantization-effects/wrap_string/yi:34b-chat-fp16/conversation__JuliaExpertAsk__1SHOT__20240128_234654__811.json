If a word is longer than the allowed line width, it will be split at its first whitespace and the remainder will be added to the next line.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\njulia> wrap_string(\"Hello world this is a very long sentence that needs to be wrapped into multiple lines.\")\n\"Hello world\\nthis is a very long sentence\\nthat needs to be wrapped into multiple lines.\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,244],"elapsed":18.897491025,"_type":"aimessage"}]
