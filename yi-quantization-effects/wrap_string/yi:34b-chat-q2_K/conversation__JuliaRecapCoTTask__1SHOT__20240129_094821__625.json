[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

It should iterate over the words in the string and add a new line after each word if adding that word to the current line would exceed the maximum width specified by `text_width`.\n\n### Example Usage:\n\n```julia\n# Example text\ntext = \"Hello World This is an example of how the function might be used\"\n\n# Call wrap_string with a custom text_width\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, 15)  # Expecting something like \"Hello World\\nThis is an example\"\n```\n\nThe `wrapped_text` should be a new string that respects the maximum width of 15 characters per line. When using a text width of 15, the output should look like this:\n\n```plaintext\nHello World\nThis is an example\n```\n\n## Double-check the Solution\n\nCheck that the `wrap_string` function works as expected for different input texts and text widths. Ensure that it handles cases where words are longer than the maximum width by themselves (in which case they should be wrapped to a new line). Also, check that trailing spaces are preserved if they do not cause wrapping.\n\n## Special Instructions: None provided\n\nIf there were special instructions, they would be included here in the format `{{instructions}}`. Since no special instructions were provided, we will proceed with the task as described above.","status":200,"tokens":[0,533],"elapsed":14.45036934,"_type":"aimessage"}]
