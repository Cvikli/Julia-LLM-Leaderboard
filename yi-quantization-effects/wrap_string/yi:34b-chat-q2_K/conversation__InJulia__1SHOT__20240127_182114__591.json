It then iterates over the words and appends them to a new line each time the length of the current line plus the word exceeds the specified `text_width`. If the last line doesn't reach the maximum width, it is also included in the output.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\njulia> wrap_string(\"This is a very long string that needs to be wrapped into multiple lines.\")\n\"This is a very\\nlong string\\nthat needs to be\\nwrapped into\\nmultiple lines.\"\n```\n\nIn this example, the function wraps the input string at each space character because the maximum text width (`text_width=10`) is less than the length of any word in the string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,322],"elapsed":8.226180351,"_type":"aimessage"}]
