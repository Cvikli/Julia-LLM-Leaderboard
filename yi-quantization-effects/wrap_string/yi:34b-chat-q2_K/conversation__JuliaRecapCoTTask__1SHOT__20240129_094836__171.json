[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded.

If the length of the word plus the current length of the line exceeds the `text_width`, it adds a new line to the result and starts the next line. The default value for `text_width` is 10 characters per line, which can be adjusted if needed.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\njulia> wrap_string(\"Hello world! This is a very long string that needs to be wrapped.\")\n\"Hello world!\\nThis is a very long string\\nthat needs to be wrapped.\"\n```\n\nThis function does not handle line breaking within words, only at the end of each word. If you need to break words as well, please provide additional instructions or modify the `wrap_string` function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,332],"elapsed":8.962507862,"_type":"aimessage"}]
