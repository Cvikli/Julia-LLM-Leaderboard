[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded.

It checks if the current word, when added to the line, will exceed the specified `text_width`. If so, it starts a new line. The function then returns all the lines joined with a newline character.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\njulia> wrap_string(\"Hello there! This is a very long sentence that should be wrapped to fit within 10 characters per line.\")\n\"Hello there!\\nThis is a very long sentence that should be wrapped to fit within 10 characters per line.\"\n```\n\nIn this example, the function wraps the text at each space character because the maximum length of each line (10 characters) is not exceeded by any word in the string. If you provide a longer word or reduce `text_width`, it will wrap as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[0,320],"elapsed":9.420412104,"_type":"aimessage"}]
