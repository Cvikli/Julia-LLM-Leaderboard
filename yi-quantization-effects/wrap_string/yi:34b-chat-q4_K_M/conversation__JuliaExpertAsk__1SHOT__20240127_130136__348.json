It then checks if each word is longer than the specified `text_width`. If so, an error is raised. Otherwise, it appends the words to a list of lines, separated by newline characters. Finally, it joins these lines with a newline character to create a multi-line string.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\njulia> wrap_string(\"This is a very long string that should be wrapped at 10 characters per line.\")\n\"This is a very\\nlong string that\\nshould be wrapped\\nat 10 characters\\nper line.\"\n```\n\nIn this example, the `text_width` is set to 10, and the function wraps the string accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[92,286],"elapsed":8.242559766,"_type":"aimessage"}]
