For each word, it checks if appending it to the current line would exceed the specified `text_width`. If so, it adds the current line to the list of lines and starts a new line for the next word. After processing all words, it returns a new string with the wrapped text, joining the lines with a newline character.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\njulia> wrap_string(\"A long string that should be wrapped at 10 characters per line.\")\n\"A long string\\nthat should be wrapped\\nat 10 characters\\nper line.\"\n```\n\nIn this example, the original string is wrapped at every 10 characters, as specified by the `text_width` parameter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,354],"elapsed":10.272874576,"_type":"aimessage"}]
