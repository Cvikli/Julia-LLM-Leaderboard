[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

If the length of `current_line` plus the length of the next word would exceed `text_width`, the current line is added to the result as a new element, and `current_line` is reset to an empty string. After all words have been processed, the final value of `current_line` is also appended to the result.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\njulia> wrap_string(\"Hello there this is a very long sentence that should be wrapped at 10 characters per line.\")\n3-element Vector{String}:\n \"Hello there\"\n \"this is a\"\n \"very long sentence that should be wrapped at 10 characters per line.\"\n```\n\nIn this example, the function wraps the string at each occurrence of a space where the total length of the line (including the space) would exceed `text_width=10`.","status":200,"tokens":[11,346],"elapsed":9.970283754,"_type":"aimessage"}]
