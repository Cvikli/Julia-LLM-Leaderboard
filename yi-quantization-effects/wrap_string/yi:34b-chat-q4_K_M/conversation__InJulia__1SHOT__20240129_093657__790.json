If a line does not exceed `text_width`, it is simply added to the list of new lines without any modifications. The `findnext` function is used to find the position of the next space in the line, and `sub` is used to create a substring up to that space or until the end of the line if no more spaces are found.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"This is a very long sentence that should be wrapped at 10 characters per line.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nThe output will look like this:\n\n```\nThis is a very\nlong sentence that\nshould be wrapped\nat 10 characters\nper line.\n```\n\nNotice how the original text was split into lines, with each line having approximately 10 characters (the `\\n` character itself does not count towards the length).","status":200,"tokens":[0,562],"elapsed":16.287542288,"_type":"aimessage"}]
