[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded.

For each word, it checks if adding it to the current sum of lengths of all words in the new lines would exceed the specified `text_width`. If so, a new line is added. Finally, the new lines are joined back together with newline characters between them.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\njulia> wrap_string(\"Hello there this is a very long string that should be wrapped at 10 characters per line\")\n\"Hello\\nthere\\nthis\\nis\\na\\nvery\\nlong\\nstring\\nthat\\nshould\\nbe\\nwrapped\\nat\\n10\\ncharacters\\nper\\nline\"\n```\n\nIn this example, the input string is wrapped at every 10 characters to create a new line.","status":200,"tokens":[0,304],"elapsed":8.906327745,"_type":"aimessage"}]
