It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded.

The newline character itself is not added to the output; instead, it represents the position where the line would be wrapped if printed.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\njulia> wrap_string(\"Hello, this is a very long string that will exceed the text width of 10 characters per line.\")\n8-element Array{String,1}:\n \"Hello, this is\"\n \"a very long s\"\n \"tring that wil\"\n \"l exceed the t\"\n \"ext width of\"\n \" 10 characters\"\n \" per line.\\n\"\n```\n\nAs you can see, the string has been wrapped at every position where adding another character would exceed the `text_width` limit. The final newline character is also included in the output to signify the end of the text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,334],"elapsed":9.003245159,"_type":"aimessage"}]
