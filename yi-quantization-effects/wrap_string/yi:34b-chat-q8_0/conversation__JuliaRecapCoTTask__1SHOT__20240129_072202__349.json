[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

This is a very long string that should be wrapped at 10 characters per line.\")\n\"Hello world.\\nThis is a very long string that should be wrapped at 10 characters per line.\"\n```\n\nExplanation:\nThe `wrap_string` function splits the input string into words and then iterates over them, checking if adding each word to the current line would exceed the maximum text width. If so, it adds a new line and prints a message indicating why the new line was added. The `next_line` function is a helper that checks if adding the current word would cause the total length of the current line to exceed the limit.","status":200,"tokens":[0,363],"elapsed":16.465906314,"_type":"aimessage"}]
