Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can define a function to wrap strings according to the specified text width using the following code:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString; text_width::Int=10)\n    lines = []\n    for word in split(text)\n        if length(word) + length(join(lines)) > text_width\n            push!(lines, \"\")\n        end\n        push!(lines, word)\n    end\n    return join(lines)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ntext = \"This is a very long string that will be wrapped to fit within the specified text width.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text; text_width=40)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nThe `wrap_string` function works by splitting the input text into words, and then iterating over them. It checks if the length of each word plus the current length of the line (which is represented by an empty string initially) exceeds the specified text width. If it does, a new line is started. Finally, all the lines are joined back together to form the wrapped string.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the words do not contain any newline characters and that the input text does not exceed the maximum text width. If you need to handle more complex scenarios, such as handling newlines or very long texts that may exceed the computer's memory capacity, you would need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,321],"elapsed":14.395449749,"_type":"aimessage"}]
