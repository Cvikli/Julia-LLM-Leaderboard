[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded.

For each word, it checks if adding it to the current sum of line lengths would exceed the specified `text_width`. If so, a new empty line is added to the list of lines to ensure that the total width does not exceed `text_width` per line. Finally, the lines are joined back into a single string with newline characters in between.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\njulia> wrap_string(\"This is a very long text that should be wrapped after 10 characters per line.\")\n\"This is a very\\nlong text that\\nshould be wrapped\\nafter 10 characters\\nper line.\"\n```\n\nBy default, the function uses a `text_width` of 10 characters, but this can be changed by providing a different integer value:\n\n```julia\njulia> wrap_string(\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\", text_width=20)\n\"The quick\\nbrown fox\\njumps over\\nthe lazy\\ndog.\"\n```\n\nIn both examples, you can see that the text has been wrapped at each instance where adding a word would exceed the specified `text_width`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,380],"elapsed":17.243538042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
