[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

It starts a new line whenever the current word (or part of a word) plus the rest of the text up to the next space would exceed `text_width` characters. The `join(lines, \"\\n\")` at the end converts the array of strings into a single string with each line separated by a newline character.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\njulia> wrap_string(\"Hello there this is a very long sentence that should be wrapped into multiple lines\")\n\"Hello there\\nthis is a very long sentence\\nthat should be wrapped into multiple lines\"\n```\n\nBy default, the function uses a text width of 10 characters per line. This can be changed by providing a different value for `text_width`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,310],"elapsed":14.051067602,"_type":"aimessage"}]
