Think through your approach step by step:\n   - Use `Threads` to parallelize the transformation of each word in the vector.\n   - Define a function `pig_latinify_word` that transforms a single word into its pig latin equivalent.\n   - Create a vector of futures to hold the results of each transformation task.\n   - Use `@spawn` to spawn a new thread for each word and assign the future to the corresponding position in the tasks vector.\n   - Wait for all threads to complete and collect the results into the `result` vector.\n\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n   - Define the `pig_latinify_word` function that handles the actual transformation of a word to pig latin.\n   - Create a wrapper function `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings and spawns threads for each word using `@spawn`.\n\n3. Solve the task:\n   - Invoke `pig_latinify` with the provided list of words.\n\n4. Check that your solution is correct:\n   - Verify that the output matches the expected result (in this case, by manual inspection).","status":200,"tokens":[0,566],"elapsed":25.596672751,"_type":"aimessage"}]
