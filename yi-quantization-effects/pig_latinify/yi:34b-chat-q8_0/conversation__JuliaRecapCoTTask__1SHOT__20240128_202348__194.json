[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The transformation is done in separate threads to improve performance.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. The main thread calculates the number of threads available (`nthreads`), divides the text into chunks of equal size (`chunksize`), and starts a future task for each chunk.\n\n2. Each future task (`@async`) is responsible for transforming the given chunk of strings into pig latin in its own thread. The `pig_latinify_thread` function does this transformation and returns the result.\n\n3. After all tasks have completed, the main thread collects the results from each future using `fetch`.\n\n4. The `pig_latinify_thread` function itself works by looping over each word in the text chunk, checking if it starts with a vowel (a simple check for consonant-vowel order is used), and then either appending \"ay\" or rearranging the letters to put the vowel at the end followed by \"ay\".\n\nPlease note that this code assumes all strings in the vector are valid English words. If you encounter any issues with the pig latin transformation, please provide specific examples so I can correct them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,695],"elapsed":31.623929916,"_type":"aimessage"}]
