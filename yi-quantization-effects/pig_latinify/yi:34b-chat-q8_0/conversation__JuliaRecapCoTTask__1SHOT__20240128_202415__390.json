[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The transformation logic is straightforward: if the first letter is one of the five vowels (a, e, i, o, u), it's followed by \"way\"; otherwise, the remaining letters are concatenated with \"ay\".\n\nWe use a `for` loop to iterate over each word in the vector and update the original vector in-place. Inside the `for` loop, we use `@threads` macro to parallelize the transformation process across multiple threads. This macro is provided by Base.Threads and allows us to specify a block of code that should be executed in parallel on different threads.\n\nPlease note that thread safety is not guaranteed within the `@threads` block for mutating operations, as it was designed with immutable data structures in mind. However, since we are operating on separate elements of the vector, which are independent, there shouldn't be any issues with race conditions or data corruption.\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function itself does not use threads; it is only the iteration over the words that is parallelized using `@threads`. This means that the transformation of each word is done in a separate thread, potentially improving performance on multi-core systems when dealing with large vectors of strings.\n\nThe `println(pig_latinified_words)` at the end prints out the resulting vector of pig latin words.","status":200,"tokens":[0,585],"elapsed":26.614498185,"_type":"aimessage"}]
