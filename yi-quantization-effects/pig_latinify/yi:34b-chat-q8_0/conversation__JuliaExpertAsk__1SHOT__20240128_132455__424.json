It uses `Threads.@threads` to parallelize the transformation over multiple threads, with each thread working on one string from the vector. The `pig_latinize` function itself handles the logic for translating a single string into pig latin.","status":200,"tokens":[0,302],"elapsed":13.550287035,"_type":"aimessage"}]
