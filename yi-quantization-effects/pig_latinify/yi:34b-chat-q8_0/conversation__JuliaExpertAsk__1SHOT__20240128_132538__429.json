It uses threading to apply the transformation in parallel using `@threads`. The actual pig latinification logic is delegated to the `pig_latinify_string` function, which you would need to implement according to your specific rules for transforming strings into Pig Latin.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you are familiar with Julia's threading model and that you have a working definition of what constitutes Pig Latin for your use case. The example provided assumes a simple rule where the last vowel (a, e, i, o, u) is taken as the new beginning of the word with \"ay\" appended, or if there is no vowel in the word, \"y\" is appended to the end.","status":200,"tokens":[0,450],"elapsed":20.244444981,"_type":"aimessage"}]
