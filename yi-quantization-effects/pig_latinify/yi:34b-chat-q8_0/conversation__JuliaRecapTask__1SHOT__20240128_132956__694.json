[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

This is used as the base transformation logic.\n- The `parallel_pig_latinify` function splits the vector of words into chunks and processes each chunk in a separate thread using the `@threads` macro provided by Base.Threads.\n- The `chunksize` is an arbitrary number that determines how many elements to process in each thread. Adjust this based on the number of threads available for optimal performance.\n- The result of each thread is collected into a vector, which is then returned.\n\nPlease note that the pig latin transformation itself does not need to be parallelized as it's a single operation per word, but the printing step within `pig_latinify` could block if done synchronously with the transformations. The parallelization in `parallel_pig_latinify` is for educational purposes and may or may not provide significant performance gains depending on the specific use case (e.g., the number of threads available compared to the amount of work per thread).\n\nTo ensure that the solution is correct, you can test it with different sets of words and check if the expected pig latin translations are printed out or returned correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,756],"elapsed":34.382284806,"_type":"aimessage"}]
