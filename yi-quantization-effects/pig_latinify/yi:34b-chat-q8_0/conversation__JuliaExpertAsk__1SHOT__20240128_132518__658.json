The `nthreads()` function is used to determine the number of threads to use for the parallel loop. The `eachindex(words)` iterator is used to generate a sequence of indices that can be used with `@threads`.\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function first initializes an output vector of the same size as the input vector. Then, it uses the `@threads` macro to iterate over each word in parallel and translate it to pig latin using the provided logic. The translated words are stored back into the output vector.\n\nThe `startsWithVowel` function is a helper function that checks if a string starts with a vowel (including \"y\" as a vowel). This is used to determine whether to add \"way\" or the first letter followed by \"ay\" to the end of the word.","status":200,"tokens":[0,488],"elapsed":21.971369216,"_type":"aimessage"}]
