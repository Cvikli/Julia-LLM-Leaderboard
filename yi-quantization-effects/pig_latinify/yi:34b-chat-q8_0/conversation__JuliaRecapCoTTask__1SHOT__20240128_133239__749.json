[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `Threads` module provides the necessary functionality for creating and managing threads within a Julia program. The `@spawn` macro is used to spawn a new task on a separate thread, and `wait()` is used to wait for all spawned tasks to complete before proceeding.\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function calculates the number of threads available with `Threads.nthreads()` and then splits the work into chunks that are processed by each thread. The `@spawn` macro is used within a loop to spawn a new task for each chunk, and `wait()` is used to wait for all tasks to complete before returning the results.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_word` function handles the actual transformation of the words according to the pig latin rules. It checks if the first character is a vowel using the `is_vowel` function, which determines whether a character is a lowercase vowel. The `string()` function is used to concatenate strings together.\n\nRemember to include any necessary imports and module definitions in your actual code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,740],"elapsed":33.672111687,"_type":"aimessage"}]
