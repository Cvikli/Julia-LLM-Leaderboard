[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It handles both cases where the word starts with a vowel and when it doesn't, following the rules of pig latin translation.\n\nThe `main` function demonstrates how to use `@threads` macro to parallelize the transformation process across all available threads. The `@threads` macro wraps a for loop, causing each iteration to run in a separate thread. The results are collected and printed out at the end.\n\nPlease note that threading can sometimes lead to race conditions if the code is not carefully designed. However, in this case, since we're only working with strings and the operations are all local (no shared state or mutable global variables), there should be no issue with concurrency.","status":200,"tokens":[377,562],"elapsed":25.794027706,"_type":"aimessage"}]
