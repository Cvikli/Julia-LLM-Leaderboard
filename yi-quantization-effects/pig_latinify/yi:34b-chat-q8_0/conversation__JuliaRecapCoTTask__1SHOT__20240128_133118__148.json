[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function itself does not mutate the original string but rather returns a new translated version of it, which is then appended to the result vector `results`. After all threads have finished their work, the `join` function concatenates all the translated words into a single pig latin sentence.\n\nThe use of `@threads` macro ensures that the loop is executed in parallel across all available threads, and the `nthreads()` function returns the number of physical cores available on the system, which we use to determine the chunk size for each thread. The `ceiling` operation ensures that we don't process more words than there are in the vector.\n\nThe solution does not depend on any external packages, adheres to the provided syntax and naming conventions, and follows the instructions provided.","status":200,"tokens":[0,576],"elapsed":26.187380682,"_type":"aimessage"}]
