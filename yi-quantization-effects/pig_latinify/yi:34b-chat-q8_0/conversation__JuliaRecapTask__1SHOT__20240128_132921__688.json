[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses the `@threads` macro to parallelize the transformation of each string into pig latin over multiple threads. The `pig_latinize` function is responsible for transforming a single string into its pig latin equivalent.\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function first creates an output vector of the same length as the input vector, then uses the `@threads` macro to iterate over each element in the input vector and apply the `pig_latinize` function to it. The `@threads` macro ensures that each iteration is performed on a separate thread.\n\nThe `pig_latinize` function handles an empty string or a word starting with a non-vowel by simply returning the original word. For words starting with a vowel, it finds the position of the first vowel (excluding the first character if it's a vowel) and then constructs the pig latin translation by moving that part to the end and prepending \"ay\".\n\nNote that using threads can introduce complexity, such as race conditions or synchronization issues. However, since each iteration is independent of the others, this parallelization should be safe in this case. Always ensure that your code is thread-safe when working with shared mutable state across threads.","status":200,"tokens":[0,548],"elapsed":24.921213044,"_type":"aimessage"}]
