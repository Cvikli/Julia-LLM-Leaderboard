It takes an optional argument `threads` to specify the number of threads to use for parallelization. If `threads == 1`, it uses a simple list comprehension to convert each string to pig latin without threading. If more than one thread is requested, it uses the `@threads` macro from Base Julia to parallelize the conversion process over each string in the vector.\n\nThe `convert_to_pig_latin` function itself is a simple helper function that converts a single string to pig latin by removing leading vowels and appending \"ay\", or adding \"ay\" to the end of the string if it doesn't already end with a vowel.","status":200,"tokens":[96,601],"elapsed":27.274563008,"_type":"aimessage"}]
