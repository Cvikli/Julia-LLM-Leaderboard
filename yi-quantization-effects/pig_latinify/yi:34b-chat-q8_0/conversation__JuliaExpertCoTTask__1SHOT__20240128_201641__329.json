The work is divided into chunks, with each chunk processed by a separate thread using `Threads.@spawn` to launch a new thread for each chunk. After all threads have finished, the results are collected and concatenated back together.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_word` function itself simply splits the word into its constituent letters, then recombines them in pig latin format (e.g., \"hello\" becomes \"ellohay\").","status":200,"tokens":[0,491],"elapsed":22.186765092,"_type":"aimessage"}]
