It defines a local function `local_pig_latinify` that handles the actual transformation of each word into pig latin. The loop inside `@threads` iterates over each index in the `words` vector and applies the transformation, ensuring that empty strings are not processed. The transformed words are then collected into a new vector and returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,417],"elapsed":13.265197068,"_type":"aimessage"}]
