It uses the `@threads` macro to iterate over each string in the vector and apply the `pig_latinize` function to it. The `pig_latinize` function determines whether the first character of the input string is a vowel, and if so, appends \"way\" to the end; otherwise, it moves the first character to the end and appends \"ay\".","status":200,"tokens":[96,253],"elapsed":8.217487478,"_type":"aimessage"}]
