It uses `Threads.@threads` to parallelize the transformation process across multiple threads. The `enumerate` iterator is used to index both the input vector and the output vector correctly. Within the threaded loop, the string is checked if it begins with a vowel or \"quiz\" (a special case in pig latin), and the appropriate pig latin translation is formed using regular expressions.","status":200,"tokens":[0,344],"elapsed":10.927007344,"_type":"aimessage"}]
