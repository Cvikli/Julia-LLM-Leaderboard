[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `@threads` macro is a convenience macro that automatically manages thread-local variables and ensures safe parallel execution for the block of code it wraps.\n\nThe function first defines an output vector with the same length as the input vector. Then, within the `@threads` block, each word is checked to see if it starts with a vowel using the helper function `is_vowel_initial`. If the word begins with a consonant, the consonants at the beginning are moved to the end, and \"ay\" is added; otherwise, if it starts with a vowel, \"way\" is appended.\n\nThe `findlast` function is used to locate the last position of a character that is not a vowel, which determines where to split the word for reassembly in pig latin. The substring functionality is then used to extract the parts before and after this position, and these are concatenated back together with \"ay\" added.\n\nThe `is_vowel_initial` function checks if the first character of a word is a vowel, considering 'y' as a vowel only when it's not followed by an 'a' (as in \"yes\" or \"you\").\n\nPlease note that the strings are modified in place to avoid unnecessary memory allocation, which can improve performance, especially with longer strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,649],"elapsed":20.998756166,"_type":"aimessage"}]
