[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses the `Threads` module to spawn new threads for each word using the `@spawn` macro. The results from these threads are collected using `fetch` and synchronized with `@sync` to ensure that all threads have finished before proceeding.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_single` function is a simple converter of a single word into pig latin. It handles the edge cases where the word starts with 'p' or is empty, and otherwise applies the standard pig latin transformation by moving the first letter to the end and appending \"ay\".\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you are using at least Julia 1.3, as it uses features from the `Threads` module that were introduced in that version. If you are using an older version of Julia, you will need to install a parallel processing package like `Distributed` and modify the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,439],"elapsed":14.169510069,"_type":"aimessage"}]
