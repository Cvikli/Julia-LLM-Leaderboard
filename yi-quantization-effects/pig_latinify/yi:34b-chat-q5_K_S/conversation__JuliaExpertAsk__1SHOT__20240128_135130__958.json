The actual transformation is done by the `pig_latinify_single` function, which uses a regular expression to find the first vowel and then moves the initial consonants (if any) to the end, appending \"ay\".\n\nThe main `pig_latinify` function does not use threads directly; instead, it relies on Julia's built-in parallelism support via the `@threads` macro. When you call `pig_latinify(texts)`, each string in `texts` will be processed by a separate thread (if available) using the `@threads` macro within the loop over `eachindex(texts)`.\n\nPlease note that the `@threads` macro is not a magical solution to parallelism; it works best for small, independent tasks that do not share data. In this case, since each string operation is independent and does not require shared memory, parallelization with threads can be beneficial.","status":200,"tokens":[0,610],"elapsed":19.525385223,"_type":"aimessage"}]
