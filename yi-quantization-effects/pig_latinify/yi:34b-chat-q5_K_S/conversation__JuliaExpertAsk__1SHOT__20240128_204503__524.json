The transformation is done in parallel using `Threads` in Julia. Each chunk of the strings is processed by a separate thread, and the results are collected back into a single vector. The `pig_latinify_chunk` function does the actual work of transforming a subset of strings into Pig Latin.","status":200,"tokens":[0,441],"elapsed":14.036708925,"_type":"aimessage"}]
