[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It does this by spawning a separate thread for each word using `@spawn`, then waiting for all threads to finish and collecting their results. The `process_word` function is where the actual transformation takes place, following the rules described in the special instructions.\n\nThe use of `Threads` here allows for concurrent processing of the words, which can lead to a performance improvement if the computation time for each word is significant and there are many words to process. However, it's worth noting that for a task like this, the overhead of spawning threads might not be worth the benefit unless the words are very long or complex.\n\nAlso, the `Threads` API in Julia is designed with the philosophy that threads should be as independent as possible, which is why we use `fetch` to retrieve the result from each thread. The `synchronize` function blocks until all spawned threads have completed their work and returned a result.\n\nThe code is written to be clear and understandable, with minimal dependencies on external libraries, in line with the provided guidelines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,576],"elapsed":18.620189098,"_type":"aimessage"}]
