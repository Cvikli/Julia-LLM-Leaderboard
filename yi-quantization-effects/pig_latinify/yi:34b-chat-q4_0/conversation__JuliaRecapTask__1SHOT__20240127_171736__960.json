[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function creates a future for each word, which is then appended to a vector of futures. It then waits for all threads to finish and collects the results, discarding any empty strings that might have occurred due to punctuation or non-letter characters.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_word` function handles the actual transformation of a word into Pig Latin. If the word is empty or consists only of a single non-letter character (like '-' for contractions), it is ignored. Capital letters are first converted to lowercase before applying the rules for Pig Latin formation.\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes that all words will be valid English words and does not account for punctuation. It also assumes that the input `words` vector is safe to modify in place.","status":200,"tokens":[0,633],"elapsed":17.097670088,"_type":"aimessage"}]
