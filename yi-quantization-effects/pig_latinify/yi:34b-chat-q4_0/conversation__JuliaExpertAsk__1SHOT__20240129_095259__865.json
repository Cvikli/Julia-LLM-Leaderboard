For each string, it asynchronously calls `pig_latinify_string` to translate it into Pig Latin and prints the result from within the thread that performed the translation.\n\nThe `@sync` macro ensures that all threads are synchronized before exiting the loop, and `@async` is used to run each iteration in a separate thread.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_string` function itself is left as an exercise for the reader to implement the actual logic of converting a string into Pig Latin.","status":200,"tokens":[108,271],"elapsed":12.522400126,"_type":"aimessage"}]
