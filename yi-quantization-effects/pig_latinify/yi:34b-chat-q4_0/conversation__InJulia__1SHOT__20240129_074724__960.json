It also handles the remaining strings that don't fit neatly into chunks by processing them sequentially at the end. Each thread is responsible for translating a chunk of strings to Pig Latin, and then the results are concatenated back together.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_single` function is used to translate individual strings to Pig Latin, while `pig_latinify_chunk` is used to translate chunks of strings in parallel. The `nprocs()` function is used to determine the number of available processors (threads) on the machine.\n\nPlease note that this code uses the `Threads` standard library and `Future` objects to manage asynchronous tasks. It assumes that the length of `strs` is greater than the number of threads minus 1, which is why we subtract 1 from the `remotecall_id` when accessing the result array.\n\nWhen running this code, you should see an output like:\n\n```\n[\"Helloay\", \"thereway\", \"howareyouway\"]\n```\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function will return a vector with each string in Pig Latin form.","status":200,"tokens":[0,923],"elapsed":25.272113022,"_type":"aimessage"}]
