[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses multiple threads to translate each word in parallel using a separate thread. A channel is used for communication between the main process and the threads. The `translate_word` function is responsible for actually translating a word to Pig Latin and placing it on the queue.\n\nThe `pig_latinize` function is where you would implement the translation logic. It currently returns an empty string, which you should replace with your implementation of the Pig Latin transformation.\n\nTo use the function, simply pass in a vector of strings and optionally specify the number of threads to use:\n\n```julia\njulia> words = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n3-element Vector{String}:\n \"apple\"\n \"banana\"\n \"cherry\"\n\njulia> pig_latinify(words)\n3-element Vector{String}:\n \"appleay\"\n \"bananay\"\n \"cherryay\"\n```\n\nBy default, it uses four threads, but you can change this by providing a different value for the `threads` keyword argument.","status":200,"tokens":[11,622],"elapsed":16.823596951,"_type":"aimessage"}]
