The `pig_latinify_threaded` function would need to be implemented with the appropriate translation logic. Also, make sure to adjust the `wait` call as necessary if you're using an older version of Julia that doesn't have the `Threads` module with a `wait()` function.","status":200,"tokens":[96,252],"elapsed":6.825553201,"_type":"aimessage"}]
