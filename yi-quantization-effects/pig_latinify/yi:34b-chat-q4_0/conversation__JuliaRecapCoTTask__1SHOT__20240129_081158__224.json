[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It creates a separate task for each word using `@async` to convert it to Pig Latin asynchronously. The tasks are awaited, and the results are collected into another vector.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_word` function defines how to convert a single word to Pig Latin. If the first letter is not alphabetic or if the word is empty, the word is returned unchanged.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you're using at least Julia 1.3, which introduced `Future` and asynchronous programming features. The number of threads (`threads=4`) is a default value and can be adjusted depending on the desired concurrency level.","status":200,"tokens":[0,465],"elapsed":12.799215715,"_type":"aimessage"}]
