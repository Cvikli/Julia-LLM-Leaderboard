It uses `Threads` to run each string conversion to Pig Latin in parallel. The `pig_latinify_string` function is implemented with the pig latin rules and is run asynchronously for each string using `@async`.\n\nThe `wait.(threads)` command waits for all threads to finish before continuing, and then `take!(threads[i])` retrieves the result of each thread and stores it in the output vector.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes you have a Julia version that supports the syntax used with the `Threads` package. If you're using an older version, you may need to use a different approach or package for multithreading.","status":200,"tokens":[0,522],"elapsed":13.874356508,"_type":"aimessage"}]
