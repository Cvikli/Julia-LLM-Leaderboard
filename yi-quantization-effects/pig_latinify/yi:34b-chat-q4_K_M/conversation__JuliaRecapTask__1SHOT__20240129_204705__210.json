[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function uses `Threads.nthreads()` to determine the number of threads available and splits the input vector into chunks that can be processed in parallel using `@threads` macro.\n2. Each thread processes a chunk of words using `pig_latinify_chunk`, which applies the pig latin rules to each word and appends the result to the final array.\n3. The `is_vowel` function checks if a character is a vowel according to the English language.\n4. The `pig_latinify_word` function handles the actual transformation of words into pig latin. If the first character is not a vowel, it moves the consonant to the end and adds \"ay\"; otherwise, it just appends \"way\" to the word.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you are using a version of Julia that supports `@threads` and multithreading in general. If you're using an older version, you may need to update or adjust the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,825],"elapsed":24.441160151,"_type":"aimessage"}]
