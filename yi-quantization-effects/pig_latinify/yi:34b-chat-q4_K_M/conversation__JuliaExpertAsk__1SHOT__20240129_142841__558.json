It uses the `@threaded_for` macro to iterate over each string in parallel using separate threads. The `pig_latinize` function is used within the loop to convert each string to Pig Latin.\n\nThe `pig_latinize` function itself handles the conversion logic, which includes:\n\n1. Checking for \"qu\" sequences and replacing them with \"qu-\" to preserve the hard 'c' sound (e.g., \"quick\" -> \"qu-ickay\").\n2. Finding the position of the first vowel in the string. If a vowel is found, the prefix before the vowel is extracted, and the rest of the word plus \"ay\" is appended to it.\n3. If no vowels are found (e.g., \"sneeze\"), then just \"ay\" is appended to the end of the string.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you are using a recent version of Julia that supports the `@threaded_for` macro for parallel processing.","status":200,"tokens":[0,505],"elapsed":14.658680319,"_type":"aimessage"}]
