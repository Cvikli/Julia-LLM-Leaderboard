The actual transformation logic is delegated to the `pig_latinify_string` function, which for simplicity is assumed to be thread-safe (though it's not explicitly shown here).\n\nPlease note that the `@threads` macro should be used with caution, especially when working with mutable state or side effects. If the `pig_latinify_string` function were not thread-safe, you would need to take additional measures to ensure correct behavior, such as using atomic operations or locking mechanisms.","status":200,"tokens":[0,481],"elapsed":13.667772183,"_type":"aimessage"}]
