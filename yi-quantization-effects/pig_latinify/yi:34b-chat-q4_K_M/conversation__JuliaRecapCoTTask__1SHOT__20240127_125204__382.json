X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

However, please note that without specific instructions (e.g., `{{instructions}}`), I will assume a set of default instructions that are in line with the problem solving steps and Julia language reminders provided.

The first function, `pig_latinify`, is a sequential version that demonstrates how to convert a single word into pig latin. It breaks the word into sounds/letters, moves the first sound to the end, appends \"ay\", and then concatenates all the words together with spaces between them.\n\nThe second function, `pig_latinify_parallel`, is a parallel version that uses threads to process chunks of the input vector simultaneously. It divides the words into equal-sized chunks and assigns each chunk to a thread for processing. Each thread then calls the sequential `pig_latinify` function to transform its chunk before concatenating all results.\n\nPlease note that this is a basic implementation and may need optimization depending on the size of the input vector and the desired performance characteristics. If specific instructions were provided, they would replace the placeholder `{{instructions}}` in the special instructions section above.","status":200,"tokens":[0,737],"elapsed":21.259860871,"_type":"aimessage"}]
