[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses the `@threads` macro to parallelize the processing across multiple threads. The vector is split into chunks, and each chunk is processed by a separate thread. Within each thread, the function iterates over the words in its chunk and converts them to pig latin using the `convert_to_pig_latin` helper function.\n\nThe `convert_to_pig_latin` function handles the conversion of a word to pig latin by checking if the first letter is a vowel or not. If it's a vowel, the entire word is suffixed with \"way\". Otherwise, everything after the first consonant (including the first consonant) is moved to the end of the word and suffixed with \"ay\". The original vector is then updated with the transformed words.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you are using a modern version of Julia where `@threads` is available. If you are using an older version, you may need to use `Threads.@spawn` or other threading mechanisms provided by the `ThreadingUtilities` package.","status":200,"tokens":[0,607],"elapsed":17.996082554,"_type":"aimessage"}]
