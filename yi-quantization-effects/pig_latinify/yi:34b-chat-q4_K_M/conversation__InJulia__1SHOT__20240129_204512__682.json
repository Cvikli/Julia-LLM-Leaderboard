Here's how you can define the `pig_latinify` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(texts::Vector{String})\n    # Initialize an output vector of the same length as texts\n    output = Vector{String}(undef, length(texts))\n\n    # Spawn a thread for each string in texts and collect the results\n    Threads.@spawn for (i, text) in enumerate(texts)\n        output[i] = pig_latinify_string(text)\n    end\n\n    # Wait for all threads to finish and return the output vector\n    return output\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_string(text::String)\n    # Pig Latin rules:\n    #   - Add \"ay\" at the end of the word.\n    #   - Move the first letter (or letters, if it's a vowel) to the end of the word and add \"ay\".\n    #   - If the first letter is already part of a digraph (like CH or PH), move the whole digraph to the end.\n    vowels = 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'\n    parts = split(text, r\"([^A-Za-z])|(\\s)\")  # Split on non-word characters and spaces\n    for i in 1:length(parts)\n        if isletter(parts[i][1]) && parts[i][1] ∉ vowels  # If the first character is a consonant\n            if isletter(parts[i][2]) && parts[i][2] ∉ vowels  # And the second character is also a consonant (like \"ch\" or \"ph\")\n                parts[i] = string(parts[i][3:end], parts[i][1:2], \"ay\")  # Move the digraph to the end and add \"ay\"\n            else\n                parts[i] = string(parts[i][2:end], parts[i][1], \"ay\")  # Move the first consonant to the end and add \"ay\"\n            end\n        elseif isletter(parts[i][1]) && parts[i][1] in vowels  # If the first character is a vowel\n            parts[i] = string(parts[i][2:end], \"ay\")  # Just add \"ay\" to the end\n        else  # The part is not a letter, so we don't change it\n            parts[i] = parts[i]\n        end\n    end\n    return join(parts)  # Join the parts back together\nend\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `pig_latinify` takes a vector of strings and returns a vector with each string in Pig Latin.\n- `Threads.@spawn` is used to spawn a new thread for each element in the input vector, which calls `pig_latinify_string` to convert the individual string to Pig Latin.\n- `pig_latinify_string` follows the rules of Pig Latin to transform the given string. It splits the text into parts based on non-word characters and spaces, then applies the appropriate transformation to each part before joining them back together.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you are using a recent version of Julia (1.6 or later) that supports the `Threads` module. Also, when running on multiple threads, make sure your system has enough resources to handle the additional threading overhead.","status":200,"tokens":[0,848],"elapsed":24.866601332,"_type":"aimessage"}]
