[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It iterates over the indices of the vector and operates on one string at a time, ensuring that no two threads are modifying the same element of the vector simultaneously. The `undef` initializer for the `result` vector tells Julia to allocate memory for the vector but leave it uninitialized, which is safe in this case because we're overwriting each element as we go.\n\nThe function checks if the word is empty and handles that case by returning an empty string. For non-empty words, it separates the first letter from the rest of the word and applies the pig latin transformation rules: If the first letter is a letter (not a number or symbol), the rest of the word is appended to the first letter followed by \"ay\". Otherwise, the original word is kept unchanged.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the input strings are valid English words and does not perform any additional checks or error handling.","status":200,"tokens":[0,386],"elapsed":11.350918292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
