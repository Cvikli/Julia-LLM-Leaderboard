[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `process_main` function is used for even-numbered strings, while `process_threaded` is used for odd-numbered strings.\n\nThe `pig_latinize` function is a simple implementation of the pig latin transformation where the first letter of each word (if it's a letter) is appended to \"ay\" and the rest of the word is moved after the new prefix. Non-alphabetic characters are left unchanged.\n\nPlease note that this code does not include any error checking or handling, as none was requested in the instructions. It also assumes that the input strings do not contain any control characters or non-printable ASCII characters.","status":200,"tokens":[11,690],"elapsed":20.445631183,"_type":"aimessage"}]
