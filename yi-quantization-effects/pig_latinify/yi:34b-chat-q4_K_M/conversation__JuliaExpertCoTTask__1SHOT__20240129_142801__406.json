[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Thinking through the approach step by step:\n\n1. Define a function `pig_latinify` that takes a vector of strings as input.\n2. Inside the function, create a list to store the pig latin translations of each string.\n3. Use `Threads.@threads` macro to iterate over the strings in parallel and add their pig latin translations to the list.\n4. After all threads have finished, return the list of translated strings.\n5. Define a simple rule for translating to pig latin (e.g., if the first letter is a consonant, add \"ay\" after removing the first letter; if it's a vowel, just add \"way\").\n6. Ensure that the function works correctly by testing it with some example strings.\n\n# Writing functions and other code:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    pig_latin_words = []\n    Threads.@threads for word in words\n        if is_vowel_initial(word[1])\n            push!(pig_latin_words, \"$wordway\")\n        else\n            push!(pig_latin_words, \"$(word[2:end])ay\")\n        end\n    end\n    return pig_latin_words\nend\n\nfunction is_vowel_initial(c)\n    return c in 'a' : 'z' && lowercase(String(c)) in \"aeiou\"\nend\n```\n\n# Solving the task:\n\n```julia\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\n```\n\n# Checking that the solution is correct:\n\nThe output should be a vector containing the pig latin translations of each string in the input vector. For the provided example, the expected output would be:\n\n```julia\n[\"helloay\", \"appleway\", \"strongtay\", \"worlday\"]\n```\n\nPlease note that this is a basic implementation and may need to be adjusted for specific language rules or requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,475],"elapsed":13.846903496,"_type":"aimessage"}]
