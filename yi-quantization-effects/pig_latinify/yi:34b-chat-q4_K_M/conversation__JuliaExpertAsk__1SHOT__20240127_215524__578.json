It's important to note that `@threaded_for` is a macro from Julia Base that was introduced in version 1.8, so you would need at least that version of Julia to use this feature.\n\nThe pig latin transformation itself is a simple concatenation of the first letter followed by \"ay\" and the remaining letters of the original string. The function assumes that the strings are not empty and does not perform any error checking or handling for edge cases (like strings that start with a space or punctuation).","status":200,"tokens":[96,465],"elapsed":13.378380521,"_type":"aimessage"}]
