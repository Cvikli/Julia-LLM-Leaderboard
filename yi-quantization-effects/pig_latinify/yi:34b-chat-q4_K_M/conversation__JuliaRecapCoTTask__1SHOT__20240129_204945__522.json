[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function is the main entry point and it's responsible for distributing the work across threads. It does this by chunking the input vector into smaller pieces, with each piece being processed in a separate thread using asynchronous execution.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_chunk` function is where the actual transformation of words to pig latin occurs. It iterates over a chunk of words and applies the following rules:\n\n1. If the word starts with a vowel, we add \"ay\" to the end of the word.\n2. If the word does not start with a vowel, we take everything before the first vowel, add \"way\", and then append the rest of the word followed by \"ay\".\n\nIf the word is empty, we just return it as-is.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you are running on a machine with multiple cores, and it uses the `nprocs()` function to determine the number of threads to use. The `@sync` macro ensures that all threads have completed their work before the next line of code is executed.\n\nTo use this function, simply call `pig_latinify(words)` where `words` is a vector of strings you want to convert to pig latin.","status":200,"tokens":[0,694],"elapsed":20.505196007,"_type":"aimessage"}]
