It uses the `@threads` macro from Base to parallelize the transformation over each string in the vector. The `pig_latinize` function is used to convert a single string into Pig Latin. This function checks if the first two characters of the input string are vowels; if so, it appends \"way\" to the end of the string; otherwise, it concatenates the first character with \"ay\" at the end, after dropping the first character from the original string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,280],"elapsed":8.080505761,"_type":"aimessage"}]
