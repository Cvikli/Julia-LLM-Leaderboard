[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses the `@threads` macro to parallelize the iteration over each string in separate threads. The `vowel_sound` variable is used to determine whether the first character of the word is a vowel, which affects how the pig latin transformation is applied. If the first character is a vowel, the entire word is suffixed with \"way\"; otherwise, everything but the first character is prefixed with \"ay\" and the first character is appended to the end.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you are using at least Julia 1.3, as the `@threads` macro was introduced in that version. If you are using an earlier version of Julia, you may need to use `ThreadsX` or a similar package to achieve parallelism.","status":200,"tokens":[0,358],"elapsed":10.517939091,"_type":"aimessage"}]
