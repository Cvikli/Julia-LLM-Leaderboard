[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses thread-safe operations to divide the string processing across multiple threads. The `chunks` vector is created with `undef`, indicating that the elements will be filled in later. Each chunk represents a subset of the strings that will be processed by a separate thread.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_string` function handles the actual transformation of a single string into Pig Latin. It searches for the first vowel (a, e, i, o, u) and then constructs the Pig Latin translation by appending \"ay\" to the end of the string after the vowel and prefixing the remaining initial portion of the string. If no vowel is found, an empty string is returned.\n\nThe `findfirst` function is used to find the first occurrence of a vowel in the string. If it finds one, it constructs the Pig Latin translation by appending \"ay\" to the end of the string after the vowel and prefixing the remaining initial portion of the string. If no vowel is found, an empty string is returned.\n\nThe `Threads.@threads` macro is used to parallelize the processing of each chunk across threads. Each thread processes one element of the `chunks` vector, which corresponds to a subset of the original strings. The resulting strings are collected into a new vector and returned by the `pig_latinify` function.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the provided strings do not contain any non-ASCII characters or symbols that would prevent them from being converted to Pig Latin. If such characters are present, you may need to adjust the `pig_latinify_string` function to handle them appropriately.","status":200,"tokens":[0,701],"elapsed":20.733653739,"_type":"aimessage"}]
