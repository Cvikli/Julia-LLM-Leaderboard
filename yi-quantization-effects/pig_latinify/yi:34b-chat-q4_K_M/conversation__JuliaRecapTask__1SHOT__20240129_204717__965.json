[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin.

It checks if the first character of the word is a vowel and applies the appropriate rule for converting to pig latin. If not, it strips off the first character and concatenates it with \"ay\" at the end.\n- The `subs` function is used to get all characters from the second position to the end of the string. This is necessary because we want to include the first consonant in the word after the vowel but not the leading vowel itself.\n- The `fetch` function is used to retrieve the result of each future, which is then collected into a vector and returned as the output.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you are using at least Julia 1.3, as it uses the `@spawn` macro for thread spawning, which was introduced in that version.","status":200,"tokens":[0,423],"elapsed":12.492880871,"_type":"aimessage"}]
