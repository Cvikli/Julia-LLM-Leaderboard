The `pig_latinify_chunk` function iterates over each word in a chunk and applies the pig latin transformation. Note that this is a simple example, as the task does not specify how to handle words with different structures (e.g., contractions, possessives) or non-English words.","status":200,"tokens":[0,284],"elapsed":8.059708518,"_type":"aimessage"}]
