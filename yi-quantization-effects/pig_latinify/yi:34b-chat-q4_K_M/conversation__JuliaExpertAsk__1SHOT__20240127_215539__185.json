The `@threads` macro is used to iterate over the elements of the vector and process them concurrently. Each thread runs the `pig_latinify_str` function, which applies the rules of Pig Latin to transform a single string.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_str` function checks if the string starts with a vowel or consonant (excluding 'h' when it's not followed by a vowel) and applies the corresponding transformation rule. It also handles empty strings as a special case.","status":200,"tokens":[0,532],"elapsed":15.160813068,"_type":"aimessage"}]
