It uses Julia's built-in `@threads` macro to run the transformation for each string in parallel using separate threads. The `pig_latinize` utility function is used to convert a single string to Pig Latin. This function handles both words that start with vowels and those that start with consonants, following the rules of Pig Latin.","status":200,"tokens":[0,366],"elapsed":10.630928697,"_type":"aimessage"}]
