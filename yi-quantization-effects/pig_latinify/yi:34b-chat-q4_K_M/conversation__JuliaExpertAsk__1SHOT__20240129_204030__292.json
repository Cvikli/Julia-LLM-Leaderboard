However, this will only work if you have multiple threads available in your Julia session. If you want to ensure that it works regardless of the number of threads, you should use `Threads.@spawn` instead and collect the results.\n\nAlso, the `pig_latinize` function is a placeholder and needs to be implemented with the actual logic for translating strings into Pig Latin. The example provided translates \"Hello\" to \"elloHay\", but you would need to complete the function with the full translation algorithm.","status":200,"tokens":[96,293],"elapsed":8.647678376,"_type":"aimessage"}]
