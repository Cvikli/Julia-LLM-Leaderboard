[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It divides the input words into chunks and assigns each chunk to a separate thread for processing using `Threads.@threads` macro. The `pig_latinify_chunk` function is used to convert each chunk of words to Pig Latin. The `pig_latin` function itself defines how to transform an individual word into its Pig Latin equivalent.\n\nThe output will print the original words followed by their Pig Latin translations:\n\n```plaintext\n[\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"date\", \"eagle\"]\n[\"appleway\", \"bananaway\", \"cherryway\", \"dateway\", \"eaglegay\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,641],"elapsed":18.933325543,"_type":"aimessage"}]
