It uses the `@threads` macro to parallelize the transformation process across multiple threads. The actual pig latin transformation is done within the threaded loop using two helper functions: `pig_latinize` and `tail`.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you are familiar with Julia's multithreading capabilities and that your system supports hardware threads (multiple cores). Additionally, ensure that the strings being processed are not too long to avoid thread-related issues.","status":200,"tokens":[0,443],"elapsed":12.835524621,"_type":"aimessage"}]
