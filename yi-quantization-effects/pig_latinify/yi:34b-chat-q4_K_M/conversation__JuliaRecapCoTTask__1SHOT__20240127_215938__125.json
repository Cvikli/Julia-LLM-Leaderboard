[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It iterates over each word in a vector and transforms it into Pig Latin. If the word is empty, it remains unchanged. Otherwise, it is split into parts by spaces, the first part is taken, and \"ay\" is appended to the rest of the word. The result is then concatenated back together with spaces.\n\nThe `@threaded_for` macro from Base provides a convenient way to parallelize for loops in Julia. It automatically manages thread creation and data distribution across threads. In this case, each word is processed by a separate thread, which can improve the performance of the transformation if the processing time per word is significant.\n\nPlease note that the `@threaded_for` macro is still considered experimental as of my knowledge cutoff in 2023 and may not be suitable for all types of computations. For example, it might not provide a speedup on operations that are already highly optimized for sequential execution or if the overhead of thread creation outweighs the benefits of parallelization.","status":200,"tokens":[0,407],"elapsed":11.729462749,"_type":"aimessage"}]
