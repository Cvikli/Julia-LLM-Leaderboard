[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin.

The special instructions indicate that the user is familiar with Julia's syntax and features, including control structures, functions, arrays, tuples, dictionaries, and string interpolation.\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads: @threads\n\n# Define a function to translate a single word to Pig Latin\nfunction translate_to_pig_latin(word::AbstractString)\n    first_letter = first(word)\n    rest_of_word = substring(word, 2)\n    return first_letter * \"ay\" * rest_of_word\nend\n\n# Define the pig latin transformer function that operates on a vector of strings\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{AbstractString})\n    pig_latin_words = Vector{AbstractString}(undef, length(words))\n    @threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        word = words[i]\n        pig_latin_words[i] = translate_to_pig_latin(word)\n    end\n    return pig_latin_words\nend\n\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"Hello\", \"World\", \"Julia\", \"Programming\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(\"Pig Latin translations: $pig_latin_words\")\n```\n\nThis code defines a `translate_to_pig_latin` function that takes a single word and translates it to Pig Latin. The `pig_latinify` function uses this translation function within a threaded loop, applying the transformation to each word in the vector simultaneously. The result is collected into a new vector of strings.\n\nPlease note that the `@threads` macro is used for parallel execution, which may not be available on all platforms or Julia installations. If you encounter any issues with this approach, consider alternative methods for threading or adjust the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[11,471],"elapsed":13.588983742,"_type":"aimessage"}]
