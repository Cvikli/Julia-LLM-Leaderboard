It uses the `@threads` macro from Base to parallelize the transformation over multiple threads. Each thread works on one element of the vector, transforming it to pig latin and then storing it back in the original vector.\n\nThe `pig_latinize` function handles both uppercase and lowercase first letters by appending \"ay\" to the end of the word or the rest of the word (excluding the first letter) depending on whether the first letter is uppercase or not.","status":200,"tokens":[0,329],"elapsed":9.503372601,"_type":"aimessage"}]
