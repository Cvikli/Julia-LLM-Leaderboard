[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It divides the strings into chunks and processes them on separate threads. The `chunksize` is set to be slightly larger than the number of strings divided by the number of threads to ensure that all threads are utilized for at least one chunk.\n\nThe pig latin transformation rule is as follows:\n1. If the word starts with a vowel, add \"way\" to the end.\n2. If the word starts with a consonant, move the first letter to the end and add \"ay\".\n\nIf the index of the word is a multiple of `chunksize` (which means it's at the beginning of a new chunk), the word is processed according to these rules. Otherwise, the original word is copied into the result vector. This ensures that we don't process the same word twice if the number of strings is not a multiple of the number of threads.\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes that the input `words` vector does not contain any empty strings or strings that are entirely composed of whitespace characters, as these would lead to an error in the pig latin transformation logic. If such cases are possible, additional checks should be added to handle them appropriately.","status":200,"tokens":[0,535],"elapsed":15.754062495,"_type":"aimessage"}]
