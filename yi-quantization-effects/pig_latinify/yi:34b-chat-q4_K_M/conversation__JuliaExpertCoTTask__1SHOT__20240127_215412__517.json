If the word starts with a vowel, \"way\" is added instead.\n\n2. **Write any functions and other code you need:**\n   - Define a helper function `to_pig_latin` that handles the conversion for a single string.\n   - Create the `pig_latinify` function with threading using `Threads.@threads`.\n\n3. **Solve the task:**\n   - Implement `pig_latinify` using `Threads.@threads` to parallelize the conversion of each string in the vector.\n\n4. **Check that your solution is correct:**\n   - Run the `pig_latinify` function on the provided example data and verify that the output matches expected pig latin translations.\n\nBelow is the implementation:\n\n```julia\n# Define a helper function to convert a single string to pig latin\nfunction to_pig_latin(word)\n    vowels = \"aeiou\"\n    if word[1] in vowels\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        consonants = collect(word[1:(end - 1)])\n        vowel_index = findfirst(x -> x in vowels, word)\n        return (join(word[(vowel_index + 1):]) * \"ay\") * consonants\n    end\nend\n\n# The pig latin transformer function using threading\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        # Convert each word and update the original vector\n        words[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    return words\nend\n\n# Test the function with provided data\nresult = pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\nprintln(result)  # Should print [\"helohay\", \"apppleway\", \"strohngay\", \"worldhay\"]\n```\n\nPlease note that the `Threads.@threads` macro is not available in all versions of Julia. If you are using an older version, you may need to use manual thread management or upgrade to a newer version of Julia that supports this feature.","status":200,"tokens":[197,669],"elapsed":42.88803665,"_type":"aimessage"}]
