It uses the `@threads` macro to parallelize the operation over each string in the vector, running the transformation on a separate thread using Julia's built-in multithreading capabilities. The `pig_latinize` function is used within the `pig_latinify` function to actually convert each string to Pig Latin. The `pig_latinize` function checks if the first character of the string is a vowel (or sounds like one, including \"y\") and handles the transformation accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,280],"elapsed":8.086707557,"_type":"aimessage"}]
