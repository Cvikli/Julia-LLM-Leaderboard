[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(input::Vector{String})\n    output = Vector{String}(undef, length(input))\n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(input)\n        output[i] = pig_latin(input[i])\n    end\n    return output\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(text::String)\n    vowel_sound = \"aeiouy\"\n    if text[1] in vowel_sound\n        return text * \"way\"\n    else\n        return string(substr(text, 2), text[1], \"ay\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\n# Checking Correctness\n\nTo check the correctness of the solution, we can run the `pig_latinify` function on a vector of strings and compare the output to the expected result. Since threaded code is non-deterministic, it's important to ensure that each string is processed correctly according to the pig latin rules.\n\n```julia\nusing Test\n\n@testset \"Pig Latin Transformer\" begin\n    input = [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]\n    expected_output = [\"helloway\", \"appleday\", \"strongthay\", \"worldway\"]\n    actual_output = pig_latinify(input)\n    @test actual_output == expected_output\nend\n```\n\nThis test ensures that the `pig_latinify` function works correctly for the provided input.","status":200,"tokens":[0,357],"elapsed":10.145411712,"_type":"aimessage"}]
