It uses `Threads.nthreads()` to determine how many threads to spawn and then divides the work among those threads using chunking. Each thread works on a portion of the original strings vector and applies the `pig_latinify_str` function to each string within its chunk. The results are collected and returned as a new vector. The actual pig latin transformation is implemented in the `pig_latinify_str` function, which follows the rules for transforming a string into pig latin.","status":200,"tokens":[0,484],"elapsed":37.593899263,"_type":"aimessage"}]
