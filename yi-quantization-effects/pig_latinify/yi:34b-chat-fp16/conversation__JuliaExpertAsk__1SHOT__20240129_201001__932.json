The `@threads` macro makes the loop run on separate threads, which can significantly speed up the processing if the strings are long and there are many of them. Inside the loop, the string is translated into Pig Latin according to the rules described.","status":200,"tokens":[0,266],"elapsed":20.641447764,"_type":"aimessage"}]
