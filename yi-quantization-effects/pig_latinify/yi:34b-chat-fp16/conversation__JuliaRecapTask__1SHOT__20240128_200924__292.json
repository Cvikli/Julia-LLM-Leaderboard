[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It divides the string vector into equal chunks and assigns each chunk to a separate thread for processing. The `@threads` macro is used to wrap the loop that iterates over these chunks, ensuring that each iteration runs on a separate thread.\n\nThe function also defines a mapping from vowels to \"ay\", which is used to pig latinify words that start with a vowel. For words that do not start with a vowel, the first letter is moved to the end and \"ay\" is appended.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that each string in the vector can be processed independently and does not require communication between threads. If the strings are dependent on each other (e.g., if they form a sentence or paragraph), then the parallelization approach would need to be reconsidered.","status":200,"tokens":[0,730],"elapsed":57.016513035,"_type":"aimessage"}]
