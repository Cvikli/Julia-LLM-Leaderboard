[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses the `@threads` macro to parallelize the processing of each word across available threads in the system. The `ThreadPool` is used to manage the threads, and the `eachindex()` function is used to iterate over the indices of the vector in a thread-safe manner.\n\nThe `process_word` function is defined inside the `pig_latinify` function to avoid polluting the global namespace. It takes a word and its index in the input vector and applies the pig latin transformation rules. The `is_vowel` function is also defined within `pig_latinify` for checking if a character is a vowel or not.\n\nThe example usage at the end demonstrates how to use the `pig_latinify` function with a sample vector of words and prints out the resulting pig latinified words.","status":200,"tokens":[0,723],"elapsed":56.579053142,"_type":"aimessage"}]
