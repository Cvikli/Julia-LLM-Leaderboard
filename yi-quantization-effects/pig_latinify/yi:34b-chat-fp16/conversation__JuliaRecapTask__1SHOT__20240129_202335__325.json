[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses the `@threads` macro to parallelize the translation of each word to Pig Latin across multiple threads. The `translate_to_pig_latin` function is used to translate individual words by identifying vowel sounds and appending \"ay\" to the end of the word.\n\nThe `@assert` statement ensures that the input vector is not empty, as it would be impossible to pig latinify an empty string. The `eachchar` iterator is used to iterate over each character in a string. The `isascii` function is used to check if a character is within the ASCII range, and `isequal` is used to compare characters for equality.\n\nThe function returns a vector of strings where each element is the Pig Latin translation of the corresponding word in the original vector.","status":200,"tokens":[377,577],"elapsed":45.245272906,"_type":"aimessage"}]
