[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function is designed to operate on a vector of strings (`words`). It first divides the input vector into equal chunks and stores them in another vector, `chunks`. Each chunk is then processed by a separate thread using the `@threads` macro.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_word!` function is where the actual transformation takes place. It handles special cases for words that start with a vowel or 'q' followed by a vowel, and otherwise applies the standard pig latin rules. The exclamation mark (`!`) in the function name indicates that it modifies its argument in place.\n\nPlease note that this code is provided as an example of how to implement the `pig_latinify` function using threading. It assumes that each word can be processed independently and that there are no performance benefits from processing words in a specific order. If the input data has certain characteristics that would benefit from a different parallelization strategy, you might need to adjust the algorithm accordingly.\n\nAlso, for debugging purposes, the transformed words are printed out after being modified. This should be removed before using the function in a production environment.\n\n### Double-checking the Solution\n\nTo double-check that the solution is correct, we can run some tests:\n\n```julia\nusing Test\n\n@testset \"Pig Latin Transformation\" begin\n    words = [\"dog\", \"apple\", \"fish\", \"bird\"]\n    expected_output = [\"ogday\", \"ppleay\", \"ishway\", \"irdday\"]\n    actual_output = pig_latinify(words)\n    @test actual_output == expected_output\nend\n```\n\nThis test verifies that the `pig_latinify` function correctly transforms a vector of simple words into their pig latin equivalents.","status":200,"tokens":[0,722],"elapsed":56.407936908,"_type":"aimessage"}]
