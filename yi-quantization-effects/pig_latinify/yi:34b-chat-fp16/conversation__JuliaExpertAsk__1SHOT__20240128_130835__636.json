It uses the threading macros from `Base.Threads` to parallelize the transformation across multiple threads. Each thread works on one element of the input vector, applying the Pig Latin translation rule to it before appending \"ay\". The function ensures that non-alphabetic characters are preserved in their original positions by checking if the first character is a consonant sound using `isalpha` and `isuppercase`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,394],"elapsed":30.567843275,"_type":"aimessage"}]
