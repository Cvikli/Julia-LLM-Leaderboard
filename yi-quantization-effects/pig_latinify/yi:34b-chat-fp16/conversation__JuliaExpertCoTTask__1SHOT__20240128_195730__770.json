It uses `Threads.threadids()` to create a thread for each element in the input vector. The `@async` macro is used to run the pig latinification on each thread asynchronously, and the results are collected into a new output vector.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_single` function follows the rules of Pig Latin to transform a single word. It checks if the word starts with a vowel and applies the corresponding transformation rule.","status":200,"tokens":[197,393],"elapsed":47.341585093,"_type":"aimessage"}]
