[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The main loop is parallelized using the `@threads` macro, which distributes the work across multiple threads. Each thread processes a portion of the text vector, ensuring that no element is processed by more than one thread.\n\nThe function `pig_latinify_single` handles the actual transformation of a single string into pig latin. It searches for the first vowel and splits the string into a prefix and suffix. The suffix is then appended with \"ay\", and the prefix is prepended to form the pig latin translation. If no vowels are found, the original string is returned unchanged.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you are using a Julia version that supports `@threads` and thread-local storage (which has been available since at least Julia 1.5).","status":200,"tokens":[0,644],"elapsed":50.310482023,"_type":"aimessage"}]
