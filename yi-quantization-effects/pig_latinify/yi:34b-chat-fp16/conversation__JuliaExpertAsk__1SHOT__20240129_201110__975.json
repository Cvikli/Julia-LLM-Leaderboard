It uses threading to process each string in parallel using the `@threads` macro. The `translate_to_pig_latin` function provides an example translation logic, which you would need to replace with your actual pig latin translation rules.","status":200,"tokens":[0,283],"elapsed":21.953464631,"_type":"aimessage"}]
