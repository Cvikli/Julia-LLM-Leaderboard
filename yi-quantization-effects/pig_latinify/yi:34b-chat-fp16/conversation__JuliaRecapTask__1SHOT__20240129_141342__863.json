[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses the `@threads` macro to parallelize the transformation over each word in the input vector. The `is_vowel` function is used within the loop to determine if the first letter of a word is a vowel.\n\nTo test this function, you can use the following code:\n\n```julia\nusing Test\n\n# Example words to pig latinify\nwords = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"dog\", \"eggplant\"]\n\n@testset \"Pig Latin Transformation\" begin\n    expected_pig_latin_words = [\"appleway\", \"bananaway\", \"cherryway\", \"dogay\", \"eggplantway\"]\n    actual_pig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\n    @test actual_pig_latin_words == expected_pig_latin_words\nend\n```\n\nThis test checks that the `pig_latinify` function works as expected for a given set of words.","status":200,"tokens":[0,610],"elapsed":47.666250965,"_type":"aimessage"}]
