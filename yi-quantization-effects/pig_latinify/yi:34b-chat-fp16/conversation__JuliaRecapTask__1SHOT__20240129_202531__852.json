[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The main loop of `pig_latinify` is parallelized using the `@threads` macro, which allows each thread to process a chunk of the words vector. The `remainder` variable ensures that we handle the leftover elements after each chunk equally among threads.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_word` function checks if the word is empty or contains spaces; if so, it returns the original word unchanged. Otherwise, it determines whether the first character is a vowel. If not, the word is modified by appending the substring \"ay\" after the first character.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you are using at least Julia version 1.5, as the `@threads` macro was introduced in that version.","status":200,"tokens":[0,532],"elapsed":41.623081774,"_type":"aimessage"}]
