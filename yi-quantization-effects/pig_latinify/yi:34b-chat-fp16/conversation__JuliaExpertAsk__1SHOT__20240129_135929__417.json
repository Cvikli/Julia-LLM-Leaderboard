You will need to implement the actual translation logic within this function. Pig Latin translation typically involves moving the first letter of a word to the end and adding \"ay\", but there are exceptions for words starting with vowels and certain consonant clusters. The `translate_to_pig_latin` function should handle these cases appropriately.","status":200,"tokens":[96,305],"elapsed":23.659338337,"_type":"aimessage"}]
