[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It does not spawn threads directly but uses Julia's multithreading capabilities through `@spawn` within the `Threads` module to run each transformation in parallel. The `@spawn` macro takes a function call and returns a Future object, which is used to wait for the result of the computation.\n\nThe `_pig_latinify` function is a helper function that actually performs the translation from English to Pig Latin. It finds the first vowel in the string (or the end of the string if no vowels are found) and then builds the pig latin equivalent by prefixing the non-vowel part of the word to the suffix \"ay\". If there are no vowels, it returns an empty string.\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function iterates over the vector of strings using a for loop with `@inbounds` to ensure that bounds checking is disabled for performance reasons (since we know the indices will be within the range of the vector). For each string, it calls `_pig_latinify` and stores the result in an output vector.\n\nSince this is a multithreaded operation, you should see a speedup on systems with more than one physical core (assuming the strings are long enough to benefit from parallel processing). The number of threads used is determined by `nthreads()`, which returns the total number of logical cores available on the system.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you have at least one thread enabled in your Julia session (which is usually the case unless you've specifically set JULIA_NUM_THREADS to 1). If you want to run with a specific number of threads, you can do so by setting `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` before running the code, for example:\n\n```sh\nexport JULIA_NUM_THREADS=4  # or any other desired number\n```\n\nand then executing your script.","status":200,"tokens":[0,713],"elapsed":55.715812351,"_type":"aimessage"}]
