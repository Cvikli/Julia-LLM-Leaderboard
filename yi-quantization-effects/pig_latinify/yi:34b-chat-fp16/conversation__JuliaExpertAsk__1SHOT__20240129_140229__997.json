It searches for the first vowel (a, e, i, o, u) in each string and applies the pig latin transformation accordingly. If no vowels are found at the start of the string, it simply appends \"ay\" to the end. Otherwise, it moves everything before the first vowel to the end and concatenates \"ay\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,313],"elapsed":24.256400982,"_type":"aimessage"}]
