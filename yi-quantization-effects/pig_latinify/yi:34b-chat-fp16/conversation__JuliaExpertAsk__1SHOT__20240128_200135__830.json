The pig latin transformation rule is as follows:\n\n1. Move the first letter of the word to the end of the word and append \"ay\".\n2. If the word begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), then just add \"way\" to the end.\n\nFor example:\n- \"Hello\" -> \"elloHay\"\n- \"Pig\" -> \"gPigway\"\n- \"Apple\" -> \"ppleAway\"\n\nYour `pig_latinify` function should ensure that each string is processed in parallel, and the final vector contains the pig latin translations of all original strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,437],"elapsed":33.909584301,"_type":"aimessage"}]
