The actual transformation is done by threads, with one thread per string to be processed. To ensure that all threads have something to work on, we divide the array into blocks and assign a thread to process each block.\n\nThe `@threads` macro is used to parallelize the loop over strings. It's important to note that the `@threads` macro should only be used in loops where the iterations are independent of one another. Since the pig latin transformation of one string does not depend on the transformation of any other string, this is a suitable use case for threading.\n\nThe `nthreads_per_block` variable is set to the number of threads available on the system, and `num_blocks` is calculated based on the length of the input vector and the number of threads per block. This ensures that each thread processes one or more strings from the input vector. The `eachindex(out_strs)` function generates a range of indices corresponding to the elements in the output array, which is used as the iteration variable inside the `@threads` macro.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_single` function contains the logic for transforming a single string into pig latin format. It checks if the first character of the word is a vowel and applies the appropriate transformation rules.","status":200,"tokens":[0,705],"elapsed":54.861847539,"_type":"aimessage"}]
