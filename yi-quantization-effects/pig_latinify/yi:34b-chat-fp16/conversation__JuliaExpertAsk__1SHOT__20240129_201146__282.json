It uses `Threads.nthreads()` to determine the number of threads available and divides the work across those threads. Each thread processes a chunk of the input vector, and if there are any remaining strings after the last chunk, they are processed by the main thread.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_string` function is used to convert an individual string into pig latin. It splits the string into words, adds \"ay\" to each word that doesn't start with \"a\", and then joins them back together with spaces. This ensures that words like \"apple\" become \"appleay\" while words like \"banana\" remain unchanged because they already start with a vowel.","status":200,"tokens":[0,466],"elapsed":36.253133602,"_type":"aimessage"}]
