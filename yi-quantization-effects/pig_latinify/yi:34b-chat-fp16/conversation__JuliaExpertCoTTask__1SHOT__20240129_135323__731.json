It uses `@async` to spawn a new thread for each word, which then performs the translation asynchronously. After all threads have finished their work, the results are collected using `wait.(threads)` and the updated vector is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[197,267],"elapsed":37.456428154,"_type":"aimessage"}]
