[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinize!` function itself splits the string into characters, applies the Pig Latin rules, and then joins them back together.\n\nTo run this on separate threads, we can use the `@threads` macro provided by Julia's `Threads` module. However, since `pig_latinize!` does not have a natural parallelization point (it operates on a single string), using threads here might not significantly speed up the process unless the strings are very long and the overhead of thread creation is low compared to the work done per thread.\n\nIf you still want to use `@threads` for educational purposes or if the strings are indeed very long, you can modify the `pig_latinify` function as follows:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads: @threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(texts::Vector{String})\n    @threads for text in texts\n        pig_latinize!(text)\n    end\n    return texts\nend\n\n# ... rest of the code remains the same\n```\n\nPlease note that using threads without proper synchronization can lead to race conditions, especially when modifying shared state. Since `pig_latinize!` does not modify any shared state and each iteration operates on a different string, there is no risk of race conditions in this particular example.","status":200,"tokens":[0,744],"elapsed":58.11217607,"_type":"aimessage"}]
