This will create a separate thread for each element, which can lead to better performance if the work per thread is significant and the data is large enough to benefit from parallelization. However, for small tasks like this, the overhead of creating threads might not be worth it, and the code could even run slower due to contention among threads.\n\nFor a more realistic scenario where you have a large dataset or computationally intensive operations, using `Threads` can lead to significant performance improvements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,632],"elapsed":49.320169503,"_type":"aimessage"}]
