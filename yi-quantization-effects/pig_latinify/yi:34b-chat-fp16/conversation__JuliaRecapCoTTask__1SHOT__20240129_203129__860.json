[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify_string` function provided is a basic example and does not account for all the rules of pig latin. For a full implementation, you would need to handle edge cases such as words starting with vowels or special characters, and possibly consult a more detailed description of the pig latin translation process.\n\nAlso, the `@threads` macro is used to parallelize the transformation over multiple threads. However, the way it is implemented here may not be optimal, especially for long strings or large collections, as each thread will have its own copy of the string being transformed, which can lead to unnecessary memory allocation and copying. For better performance, you might consider using a more sophisticated approach that avoids these issues, such as using shared memory or message passing between threads.\n\nFinally, the `@threads` macro is used with caution, as it may introduce race conditions if not used properly. In this example, since we are only appending to the strings and not modifying them in place, there is no risk of concurrent modification issues. However, if you were to modify the strings directly or use shared mutable state, you would need to ensure that your code is thread-safe.","status":200,"tokens":[0,581],"elapsed":45.462264936,"_type":"aimessage"}]
