[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It then distributes the work across multiple threads, with each thread processing a chunk of the input vector. After all threads have finished their work, it collects the results and returns them as a vector of strings.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_chunk` function is responsible for actually converting each word in the chunk to Pig Latin according to the provided rules. It accounts for the fact that if the first letter of a word is not a vowel, we add \"ay\" to the end; otherwise, we add \"way\".\n\nThe example usage at the bottom demonstrates how to use the `pig_latinify` function with a simple vector of words and prints out the resulting Pig Latinified words.","status":200,"tokens":[11,708],"elapsed":55.322697704,"_type":"aimessage"}]
