[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It defines two helper functions: `is_vowel_sound` to determine if the first syllable is a vowel sound (including \"h\" before certain vowels), and `prepend_syllable` to prepend the appropriate syllable to the word based on whether it starts with a vowel sound or not.\n\nThe function uses `Threads.@threads` macro to parallelize the loop over each string in the vector. It ensures that there are more than one thread available before proceeding and calculates the chunk size for efficient distribution of work among threads.\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes that all words are valid English words, and it does not account for punctuation or multi-word inputs.","status":200,"tokens":[0,525],"elapsed":41.086149685,"_type":"aimessage"}]
