[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The transformation is done by the `pig_latin` function, which simply appends \"ay\" to the end of the word if the first letter is a lowercase ASCII letter from 'a' to 'z'.\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function uses `Threads.nthreads()` to determine how many threads to spawn and then divides the work into chunks, ensuring that there's an additional chunk for any remaining words if the number of words is not divisible by the number of threads. Each thread processes a chunk of the input vector asynchronously using `@async`, which allows the main thread to continue while the computation is ongoing.\n\nThe code is written in a way that prioritizes performance and clarity. It uses Julia's built-in threading capabilities without relying on external packages. The `pig_latin` function is simple and efficient, performing only a few operations per word.","status":200,"tokens":[0,526],"elapsed":41.084702304,"_type":"aimessage"}]
