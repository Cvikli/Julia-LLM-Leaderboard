It creates a separate thread for each string and then blocks until all threads have finished their work using the `fetch` method. The `pig_latinify` function itself is not parallelized, as it operates on a single string at a time.","status":200,"tokens":[0,224],"elapsed":6.320779619,"_type":"aimessage"}]
