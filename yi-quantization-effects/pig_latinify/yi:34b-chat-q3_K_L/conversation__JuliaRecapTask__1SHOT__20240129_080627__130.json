[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

This macro is provided by Base.Threads and allows you to write code that will run on multiple threads.\n- The `pig_latinize` function follows two rules for transforming a word to pig latin:\n  1. If the first letter is a vowel, add \"way\" to the end of the word.\n  2. If the first letter is not a vowel, move it to the end and add \"hay\".\n- The `isvowel` function checks if a character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, or y) using ASCII values. This is necessary because in Julia, `isletter` does not distinguish between uppercase and lowercase letters, so we need to check for each vowel manually.\n- The `join` function is used to concatenate the parts of the word back together after applying the pig latin rules.\n\nPlease note that threading can be complex and may require additional considerations such as synchronization if data races are a concern. This example assumes that the input strings are independent of each other and thus can be processed in parallel without any synchronization needed between threads.","status":200,"tokens":[0,558],"elapsed":16.104140662,"_type":"aimessage"}]
