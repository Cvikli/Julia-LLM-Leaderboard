[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin.

Each thread will run the `pig_latinify` function on a different element of the vector.\n- Inside the loop, we use `replace` with regular expressions to apply the rules of Pig Latin transformation. We uppercase the text first because the regex matching is case-sensitive, and then lowercase it again after the substitution to ensure the result is in lowercase.\n- The `nthread()` function is used to get the number of threads available for parallel execution.\n- Note that this implementation does not check if the string contains more than one word. It assumes each string is a single word and applies the Pig Latin transformation accordingly.\n\nDouble-check:\n- The `pig_latinify` function should operate on a vector of strings.\n- Each iteration of the loop should run on a separate thread using `@threads`.\n- The transformation rules are case-insensitive, as specified by the uppercase and lowercase conversions.\n- The result is returned as a vector with the original order preserved.","status":200,"tokens":[0,562],"elapsed":16.219585693,"_type":"aimessage"}]
