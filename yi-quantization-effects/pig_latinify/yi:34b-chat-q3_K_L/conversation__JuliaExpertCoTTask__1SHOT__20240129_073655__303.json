It does this by defining a separate function `convert_to_pig_latin` that handles the actual conversion, and then starts a thread for each word in the list. Finally, it waits for all threads to finish and prints the results.\n\nPlease note that the code above is a basic example and may need adjustments depending on your Julia version and operating system. It's also worth mentioning that using threads can be more complex than this simple example suggests, as it involves managing concurrency and ensuring safe usage of shared resources if necessary.","status":200,"tokens":[197,432],"elapsed":29.093679167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
