Define a function `pig_latinize` that takes a string and returns the pig latin version of it.\n2. Create a vector of strings to be transformed.\n3. Use `ThreadPool` to run the `pig_latinize` function on each element of the vector in parallel.\n4. Collect the results from each thread and return them as a vector.\n\n# Code\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads: ThreadPool\n\nfunction pig_latinize(text)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    consonants = filter(c -> !in(c, vowels), text)\n    if length(consonants) == 0\n        return \"$text-ay\"\n    end\n    first_consonant = first(consonants)\n    rest_of_word = String(vowels[1]) * consonants[2:end]\n    return rest_of_word * first_consonant * \"-ay\"\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(texts::Vector{String})\n    threadpool = ThreadPool()\n    results = pmap(threadpool, texts) do text\n        pig_latinize(text)\n    end\n    return results\nend\n\n# Example Usage\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]) # Output will be printed to the console.\n```\n\n# Solution\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function now operates on a vector of strings and transforms each element into its pig latin version using multiple threads.\n\n# Checking Correctness\n\nTo check that the solution is correct, we can run the provided example usage and verify that the output matches our expectations for how pig latin transformation should work.","status":200,"tokens":[0,426],"elapsed":12.147908179,"_type":"aimessage"}]
