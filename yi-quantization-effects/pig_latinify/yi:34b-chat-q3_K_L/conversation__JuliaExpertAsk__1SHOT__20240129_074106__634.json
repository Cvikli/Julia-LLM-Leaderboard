Pig Latin translation involves moving the first consonant sound of the word (or the whole word if it begins with a vowel) to the end of the word and then adding \"ay\". If the word starts with a consonant blend, each part is moved separately. For example:\n\n- `dog` becomes `ogday`\n- `apple` becomes `ppleay`\n\nYou can use regular expressions or other string manipulation techniques to achieve this translation.","status":200,"tokens":[108,435],"elapsed":17.358852791,"_type":"aimessage"}]
