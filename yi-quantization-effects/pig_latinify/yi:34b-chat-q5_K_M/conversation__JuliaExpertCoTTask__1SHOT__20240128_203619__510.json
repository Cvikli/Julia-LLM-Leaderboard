We use `Threads.@spawn` to spawn a new thread for each string and then join all the threads after they've finished processing their respective strings.\n\nPlease note that running each iteration on a separate thread may not always be the most efficient approach, especially if the work done per thread is very small compared to the overhead of thread creation and management. In such cases, it might be better to process the strings in batches or use a different concurrency strategy.","status":200,"tokens":[197,670],"elapsed":28.459808044,"_type":"aimessage"}]
