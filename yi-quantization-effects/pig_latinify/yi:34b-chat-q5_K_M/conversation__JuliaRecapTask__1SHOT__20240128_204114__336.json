[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It then uses `@threads` to parallelize the iteration over each string in the vector. Inside the threaded loop, it applies the following rules to translate the string into Pig Latin:\n\n1. If a word begins with one of the vowels (\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", or \"u\"), append \"way\" to the end of the word.\n2. If the word is empty, return an empty string.\n3. Otherwise, remove the first letter from the word and concatenate it with the original word plus \"ay\" (the \"first_letter\" + \"ay\" part).\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes that each thread will operate on a different element of the vector, which may not be the case if the vector is small enough to fit in the CPU cache. In such cases, it might be more efficient to process the entire vector sequentially.","status":200,"tokens":[0,442],"elapsed":14.610228402,"_type":"aimessage"}]
