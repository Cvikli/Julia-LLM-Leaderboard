It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"## Step 1: Understand the Pig Latin Transformation Rule\n\nPig Latin is a language game where words are translated by moving the first letter of the word to the end and adding the suffix \"-ay.\" If the word begins with a vowel, then the entire word is moved to the end and \"-yay\" is added. For example:\n\n- \"hello\" becomes \"ello-hay\"\n- \"apple\" becomes \"pple-a-ay\"\n- \"strong\" becomes \"rong-s-tay\"\n- \"world\" becomes \"orld-w-ay\"\n\n## Step 2: Define the Pig Latin Transformer Function\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    # Initialize an output vector to store transformed words\n    out_words = Vector{String}()\n\n    # Iterate over each word in the input vector\n    for word in words\n        # Define a function that transforms a single word to Pig Latin\n        function transform_word(word::String)\n            if is_vowel_initial(word)\n                return \"$word-yay\"\n            else\n                return \"$word-hay\"\n            end\n        end\n\n        # Apply the transformation function on each word in a separate thread\n        out_words = [out_words; Threads.@spawn transform_word(word)]\n    end\n\n    # Return the transformed words vector\n    return out_words\nend\n```\n\n## Step 3: Define Helper Functions if Needed\n\nFor this task, we don't need a separate helper function as the transformation logic is simple and can be defined within the `pig_latinify` function. However, if the task required checking for vowel-initial words, a helper function could be used:\n\n```julia\nfunction is_vowel_initial(word::String)\n    return occursin(\"aAeEiIoOuUyY\", word[1]) || word[1] == \"h\" && is_vowel_initial(word[2:end])\nend\n```\n\n## Step 4: Test the Function\n\n```julia\n# Sample input data\nwords = [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]\n\n# Call the pig latinify function\npig_latinified_words = pig_latinify(words)\n\n# Print the result\nprintln(pig_latinified_words)\n```\n\n## Step 5: Check for Correctness\n\nRun the program and verify that the output matches the expected transformation for each word in the input vector. The output should be:\n\n```\n[\"ello-hay\", \"pple-a-ay\", \"rong-s-tay\", \"orld-w-ay\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[197,634],"elapsed":27.272641387,"_type":"aimessage"}]
