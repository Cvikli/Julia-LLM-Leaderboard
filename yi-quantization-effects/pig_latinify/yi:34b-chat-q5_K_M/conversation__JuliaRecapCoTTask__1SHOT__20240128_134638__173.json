[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It does this by first splitting each string into characters and then creating a thread for processing each input string's characters in parallel. The `process_characters` function is run within the threads to modify the character arrays, moving any letters to the end of the array with 'ay' appended. Once all threads have finished, the modified characters are recombined into strings and returned as a vector.\n\nThe `@sync` macro ensures that the main thread waits for all spawned threads to finish before proceeding. The `@async` macros are used to run the functions in parallel without blocking the progress of the `pig_latinify` function.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes the use of Julia 1.6 or later, as it makes use of the `@sync` and `@async` macros which were introduced in that version.","status":200,"tokens":[11,551],"elapsed":18.311883867,"_type":"aimessage"}]
