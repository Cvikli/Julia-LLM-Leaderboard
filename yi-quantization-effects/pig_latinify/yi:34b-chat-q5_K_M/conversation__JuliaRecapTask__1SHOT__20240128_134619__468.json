[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Within each thread, it iterates over every character in each string and applies the pig latin transformation rule (moving the first letter to the end and appending \"-way\") if the character is a letter.\n\nThe `isletter` function is used to determine if a character is a letter, and `uppercase` or `lowercase` are used to ensure that the letter is converted to uppercase or lowercase before being appended to the word. The `replace` function is used to replace the original character with the pig latin equivalent.\n\nAfter all threads have finished their work, the resulting strings are returned in the vector `texts`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,342],"elapsed":11.286654356,"_type":"aimessage"}]
