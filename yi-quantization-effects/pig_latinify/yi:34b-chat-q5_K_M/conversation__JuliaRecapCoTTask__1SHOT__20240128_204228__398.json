[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

If the number of threads is greater than 1, it splits the input vector into chunks and uses `pmap` to translate each chunk to Pig Latin in parallel. The `split_chunks` function ensures that each chunk has approximately the same number of elements by dividing the length of the vector by the number of threads.\n\nThe `translate_to_pig_latin` function is used both within `pmap` and as a fallback if there's only one thread available. It translates each word in the vector to Pig Latin, either by adding \"way\" to the end (if the word doesn't start with a vowel) or leaving it unchanged (if it does).\n\nPlease note that `pmap` is used here, which means that the function will be applied to each chunk in parallel if possible. The result of each chunk's processing is collected into an array and concatenated at the end. However, the use of `pmap` may not fully utilize all threads if the work per thread is not substantial enough. If this is a concern, you might want to consider other approaches like using `Threads.@spawn` or `Future`s for more fine-grained control over parallelism.","status":200,"tokens":[0,642],"elapsed":21.284784014,"_type":"aimessage"}]
