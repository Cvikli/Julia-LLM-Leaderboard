The work is divided into chunks and processed by separate threads using `Threads.@spawn` and `Future` objects.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_chunk` function processes a chunk of words in parallel, while `pig_latinify_single_word` defines the rules for transforming a single word to Pig Latin. The `subs` function is used to get the substring from the second character to the end of the word, which is then concatenated with the first character and \"ay\" to form the Pig Latin translation.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you are using at least Julia 1.3, as it makes use of `Base.Threads` and the `@sync` macro, which were introduced in that version.","status":200,"tokens":[0,719],"elapsed":23.578193267,"_type":"aimessage"}]
