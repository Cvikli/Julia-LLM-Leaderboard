[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

For example, \"Hello\" would become \"Ellohay\".\n```\n\nHere is the solution with the specified instructions:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(input::Vector{String}; progress_every=10)\n    # Initialize a counter for tracking progress\n    progress = 1\n    total = length(input)\n\n    # Start the task in parallel\n    @threads for i in eachindex(input)\n        current_word = input[i]\n        output = pig_latinize(current_word)\n        input[i] = output\n    end\n\n    # Update progress every `progress_every` seconds\n    while true\n        if (progress / total * 10) % progress_every == 0\n            print(\"\\r$((progress / total) * 100)% completed.\")\n            flush(stdout)\n        end\n\n        # Sleep for a short period to reduce CPU usage\n        sleep(1)\n\n        # Increment the progress counter\n        progress += 1\n    end\n\n    return input\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinize(word::String)\n    first_syllable = first_consonant(word) * rest_of_word(word)[2:end] * \"ay\"\n    if isempty(first_syllable)\n        # If the word starts with a vowel, add 'way'\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        return first_syllable\n    end\nend\n\nfunction first_consonant(word::String)\n    if isempty(word)\n        return \"\"\n    end\n    first_char = word[1]\n    if (isalpha(first_char) && !is_vowel(first_char)) || first_char == 'y'\n        # Treat 'y' as a consonant at the start of a word\n        return first_char\n    else\n        # Return the second character if the first is not a consonant\n        return word[2]\n    end\nend\n\nfunction rest_of_word(word::String)\n    if isempty(word)\n        return \"\"\n    end\n    return word[2:end]\nend\n\nfunction is_vowel(letter::Char)\n    return letter in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\nend\n\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"Hello\", \"World\", \"PigLatin\"]\npig_latinify(words)\n```\n\nTo use the `pig_latinify` function, simply define a vector of strings and call the function with your desired progress interval. The output will be the input vector with each string transformed into pig latin.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes you are using Julia 1.6 or later, as it makes use of the `@threads` macro for parallel processing.","status":200,"tokens":[11,762],"elapsed":25.3027072,"_type":"aimessage"}]
