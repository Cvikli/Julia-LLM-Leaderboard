It uses a thread pool to parallelize the transformation across multiple threads. The `@spawnat` macro is used to submit jobs to the thread pool, and `wait` is used to wait for each job to finish before moving on to the next string. Finally, the results are taken from the thread pool's result queue and stored in a vector that is returned at the end of the process.","status":200,"tokens":[0,367],"elapsed":11.952125488,"_type":"aimessage"}]
