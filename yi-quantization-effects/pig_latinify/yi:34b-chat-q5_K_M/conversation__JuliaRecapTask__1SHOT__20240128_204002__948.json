[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The work is parallelized using the `@threads` macro provided by Julia's standard library, which allows each thread to process a subset of the elements in the vector.\n\nThe `pig_latinize` function handles the actual transformation of a single word into pig latin. It first checks if there is a vowel sound (a, e, i, o, u, or y followed by a consonant) within the word. If not, it appends \"ay\" to the end of the word. Otherwise, it splits the word around the vowel sound and recombines it with \"ay\" at the end.\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes that the input strings are valid English words (e.g., no punctuation) and that there is at least one vowel sound in each word.","status":200,"tokens":[377,473],"elapsed":15.867400544,"_type":"aimessage"}]
