It calculates the number of threads to use (`nworkers()`) and divides the string chunking into equal parts (or as close as possible) for processing by each thread. Each thread then processes its own chunk using the `pig_latinify_chunk` function, which in turn calls the `pig_latinify_string` function to convert individual strings to Pig Latin. The results from all threads are collected and concatenated back together to form the final output vector of Pig Latin translations.","status":200,"tokens":[96,489],"elapsed":15.809290615,"_type":"aimessage"}]
