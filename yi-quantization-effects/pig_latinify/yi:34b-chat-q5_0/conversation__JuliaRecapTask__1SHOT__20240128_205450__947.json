[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses the `@threads` macro from the `Base.Threads` module to parallelize the transformation of each word in the vector across threads. The pig latin transformation itself is done inside the threaded loop, where we split the word into characters and recombine them according to the rules of pig latin (moving the first vowel-sound letter to the end and appending \"ay\").\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes the strings provided are English words and may not work correctly for non-English words or words with non-standard pronunciation. It also uses a simple rule to determine when to start building the new word, which might not cover all cases (e.g., words starting with silent letters).\n\nTo test this function, you could do something like:\n\n```julia\nusing Test\n\n@testset \"Pig Latin Transformation\" begin\n    words = [\"Hello\", \"World\", \"Julia\"]\n    expected_words = [\"elloHay\", \"orldWay\", \"uliaYay\"]\n    actual_words = pig_latinify(words)\n    @test actual_words == expected_words\nend\n```\n\nThis will run the `pig_latinify` function on a vector of words and compare the resulting transformed words with the expected results.","status":200,"tokens":[0,550],"elapsed":17.757944096,"_type":"aimessage"}]
