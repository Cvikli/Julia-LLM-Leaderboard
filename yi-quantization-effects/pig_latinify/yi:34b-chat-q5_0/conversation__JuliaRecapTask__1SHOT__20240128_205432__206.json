X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It iterates over each word using the `@threads` macro to run each iteration on a separate thread. The pig latin transformation is done according to the following rules:\n\n1. If the word begins with a vowel, add \"ay\" to the end.\n2. If the word begins with a consonant (or consonant cluster), remove it and add it to the end of the word together with \"ay\".\n\nThe `@threads` macro ensures that each iteration is run in parallel on separate threads, which can significantly speed up the transformation for large vectors of strings. However, it's important to note that string processing in Julia is not highly optimized for concurrency, and the overhead of thread creation might not be worth the benefit for small tasks or with a small number of threads.\n\nThe function first creates an empty vector of the same length as the input `words` vector to store the transformed words. Then, it uses a loop within the `@threads` macro to apply the transformation rules to each word in parallel. The `isascii` check is used to ensure that only ASCII characters are processed, which simplifies the regex matching and string slicing.\n\nThe `findfirst` function is used to find the index of the first non-vowel character, and `SubString` is used to create substrings without copying the entire string. This is more efficient than using `String` constructors with substring ranges.\n\nFinally, the example usage demonstrates how to apply the `pig_latinify` function to a vector of words and print the transformed results.","status":200,"tokens":[377,816],"elapsed":26.622918876,"_type":"aimessage"}]
