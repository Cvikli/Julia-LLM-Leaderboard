[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses `eachslice` from the `Base.Slice` module to split the input vector into chunks, one for each thread. The `threaded_pig_latinify` function is where the actual transformation takes place, and it's called within a `@spawn` macro to run on separate threads.\n\nThe `isconsonant` function defines a set of consonants to determine whether a word starts with a vowel or not. The `subs` function is used for slicing the string without the first and last characters.\n\nFinally, the test at the end ensures that the pig latinified words are correctly transformed and appended to the result vector.","status":200,"tokens":[0,790],"elapsed":25.535236084,"_type":"aimessage"}]
