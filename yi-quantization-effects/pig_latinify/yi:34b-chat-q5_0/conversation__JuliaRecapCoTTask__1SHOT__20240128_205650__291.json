[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Ensure that the `pig_latinify` function correctly handles words starting with vowels and empty strings by appending \"way\" to them.\n2. Verify that words not starting with a vowel are split into their first chunk (considering \"y\" as a consonant if it's not at the beginning of the word) and the rest, then combined in the correct order with \"ay\" added.\n3. Confirm that the `@threads` macro is used to parallelize the processing over each word in the vector.\n4. Test the function with a variety of inputs, including long strings, short strings, strings starting with vowels, and empty strings.\n5. Ensure that the output is correct and matches the expected result for pig latin translations.\n6. Check that the `pig_latinify_thread` function is correctly implemented to handle each word in a separate thread.\n7. Verify that the use of `Future` and `fetch` allows for the asynchronous execution of tasks and the collection of results without blocking.\n8. Confirm that there are no deadlocks or race conditions in the implementation, especially regarding the shared state (the vector of futures).\n\nPlease provide the Special Instructions to proceed with double-checking the solution against them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,852],"elapsed":27.593260701,"_type":"aimessage"}]
