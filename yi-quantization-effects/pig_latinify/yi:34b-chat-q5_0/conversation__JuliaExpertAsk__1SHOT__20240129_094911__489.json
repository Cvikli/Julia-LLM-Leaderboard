It uses multithreading to process the strings in parallel, dividing the input vector into chunks and assigning one chunk to each thread. The actual translation of strings to Pig Latin is done within the `pig_latinify_string` function.\n\nPlease note that this implementation may not be the most efficient for large vectors, as it creates a new vector of strings for each chunk before collecting all results into a single vector. This could result in high memory usage and overhead. The `findfirst` call within `pig_latinify_string` can also be optimized for performance, especially when dealing with long strings. However, this code provides a basic starting point for parallel processing in Julia using multithreading.","status":200,"tokens":[108,678],"elapsed":27.917643542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
