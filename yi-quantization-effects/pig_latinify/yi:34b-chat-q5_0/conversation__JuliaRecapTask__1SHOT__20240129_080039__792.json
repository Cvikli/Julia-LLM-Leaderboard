[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The vector of strings is divided into chunks, and each chunk is processed by a separate thread. Within each chunk, the strings are converted to Pig Latin using the `pig_latinify_one!` function, which modifies the string in-place and writes the result to an intermediate array.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_one!` function is designed to be efficient with two local variables, `front` and `back`, to avoid allocations from repeated concatenation. It uses a regular expression to split the source string into the leading consonants (or consonant cluster) and the rest of the word. If the entire word consists only of vowels or is an empty string, it simply appends \"ay\" to the end of the word. Otherwise, it concatenates the front part followed by the back part and adds \"ay\".\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function ensures that the result vector is the same length as the original vector of strings, and it copies the modified strings from the intermediate array to the corresponding positions in the result vector.\n\nTo test this function:\n\n```julia\nusing Test\n\n@testset \"Pig Latin Transformer\" begin\n    strs = [\"Hello\", \"World\", \"Julia\"]\n    expected_translations = [\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"uliay\"]\n    actual_translations = pig_latinify(strs)\n    @test actual_translations == expected_translations\nend\n```\n\nPlease note that the `Threads` module is a relatively new addition to Julia and may not be available in older versions. If you are using an older version, you might need to install a package like `ThreadingUtilities` or use other techniques for parallelization (like `@spawn`). Additionally, make sure to include the necessary `using` statements and imports at the beginning of your code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,767],"elapsed":24.807237399,"_type":"aimessage"}]
