It divides the string into chunks and assigns each chunk to a separate thread for processing. The `pig_latin` function is a simple implementation that adds \"ay\" or \"way\" to the end of the word depending on whether it starts with a vowel or a consonant (followed by \"qu\"), respectively.","status":200,"tokens":[96,364],"elapsed":11.719642216,"_type":"aimessage"}]
