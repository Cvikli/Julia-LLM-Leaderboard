The `pig_latinify_thread` function is where you would implement the actual translation of text to Pig Latin. This function is also run on a separate thread using `Threads.@spawn`.\n\nTo use this transformer, simply call `pig_latinify` with a vector of strings:\n\n```julia\ntexts = [\"Hello World\", \"How are you?\", \"I am fine, thank you!\"]\ntranslated_texts = pig_latinify(texts)\n# translated_texts will be a vector of the Pig Latin translations of each string in texts\n```\n\nThis code is written assuming that the Julia version being used supports `Threads.@spawn` and other multithreading features introduced in recent versions of the language.","status":200,"tokens":[0,419],"elapsed":15.581118708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
