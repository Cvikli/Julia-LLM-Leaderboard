[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses the `@threads` macro to parallelize the operation across multiple threads, with each thread processing a chunk of the input vector. The `pig_latinify_string` function is used to translate an individual string into pig latin.\n\nThe algorithm for translating a string to pig latin is straightforward: if the first character is a vowel, we add \"way\" to the end; otherwise, we move the first consonant (or set of consonants) to the end and add \"ay\".\n\n# Solve the Task\n\nGiven the provided `text` vector, apply the pig latin transformation using the `pig_latinify` function defined above. The function should return a new vector containing the translated strings.\n\n```julia\nfunction solve_task(text::Vector{String})\n    # Your code here to translate text into pig latin\nend\n```\n\n# Double-check that the Solution is Correct\n\nTo double-check that the solution is correct, you can perform a few sanity checks:\n\n1. Ensure that the length of the output vector matches the length of the input vector.\n2. Check several elements from the output vector against their expected pig latin translations to ensure the transformation is applied correctly.\n3. If possible, include a test case in your code to verify the functionality of `pig_latinify`.\n\nRemember to follow the guidelines provided and any special instructions given.","status":200,"tokens":[11,666],"elapsed":25.186254062,"_type":"aimessage"}]
