The `Threads.@threads` macro is used to run the loop over each string in parallel, ensuring that each thread processes a contiguous block of strings to avoid race conditions. The `nthreads` variable is used to determine how many threads should be used for processing.","status":200,"tokens":[0,666],"elapsed":24.913577714,"_type":"aimessage"}]
