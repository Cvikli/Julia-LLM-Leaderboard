It uses the `@threads` macro to iterate over each string in parallel, applying the pig latin transformation to each string. The pig latin algorithm is simple: if the first letter of the word is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), the word is prefixed with \"way\"; otherwise, the word excluding its first letter is appended with \"ay\".\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you are using at least Julia 1.5, which introduced the `@threads` macro for thread-based parallelism. If you're using an older version of Julia, you might need to use a different approach or update your Julia installation.","status":200,"tokens":[96,373],"elapsed":14.013498148,"_type":"aimessage"}]
