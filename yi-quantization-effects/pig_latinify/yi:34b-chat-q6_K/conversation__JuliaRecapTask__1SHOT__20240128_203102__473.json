[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Each thread works on a separate string, applies the `translate_to_pig_latin` function to it, and then updates the corresponding element in the original vector. The `nthreads` function is used to determine the number of threads to use for the parallelization.\n\nTo ensure that each thread is working on distinct elements of the vector, we use a `local` variable `local_result` inside the `@threads` block. This way, each thread can modify its own copy of `local_result` without interfering with other threads. The global vector `text` is then updated in place with the result from each thread after the parallel region has completed.\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes that the strings do not contain any null bytes (`\"\\0\"`), as these would cause issues when used as indices into the vector `text`. If such strings are possible, additional precautions should be taken to ensure safe indexing.","status":200,"tokens":[0,478],"elapsed":17.997061554,"_type":"aimessage"}]
