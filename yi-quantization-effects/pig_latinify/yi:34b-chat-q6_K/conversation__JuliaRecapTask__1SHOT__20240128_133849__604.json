[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses threading to process the strings in parallel, with one thread per core. The transformation is done asynchronously within each thread using `@async`.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of the code:\n\n1. We define an `nthreads` variable that represents the number of threads available on the system.\n2. We create a vector of tasks, one for each word in the input vector.\n3. Inside the loop that initializes the tasks, we use `@async` to start each task asynchronously. The code within the `@async` block is executed in its own thread.\n4. The transformation logic checks if the first letter of a word is a vowel. If it is, the word is appended with \"way\"; otherwise, the second part of the word (everything but the first character) is prepended to the first character followed by \"ay\".\n5. To collect the results from each thread, we use a loop within `@threads` macro to wait for all tasks to finish. We use `TaskLocalStorage` to store the result of each task locally and then retrieve it after the task is complete.\n6. The `@threads` loop iterates over the word indices, but because the work is done asynchronously, it's non-blocking. This allows the main thread to continue other operations while waiting for the tasks to finish.\n\nPlease note that this code does not use Julia 1.8's new `@sync` macro with `wait_all` method because it was introduced after the initial version of this answer. The approach using `TaskLocalStorage` is a bit more low-level and might be less efficient than using `@sync`, but it should achieve the desired result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,682],"elapsed":25.717441265,"_type":"aimessage"}]
