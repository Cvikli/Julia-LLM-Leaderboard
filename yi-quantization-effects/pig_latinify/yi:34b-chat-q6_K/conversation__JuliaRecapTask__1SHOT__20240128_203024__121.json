[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Base: Threads, @threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    length(words) == 0 && return words  # Special case for empty input\n    @threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        words[i] = translate_to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    return words\nend\n\nfunction translate_to_pig_latin(word::String)\n    # Algorithm: Move first consonant (or all if starts with vowel) to end, add 'ay'\n    consonants = 'bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxz'\n    first_consonant_index = findfirst(x -> x in consonants, word)\n    if first_consonant_index === nothing\n        # Word starts with a vowel or space, add 'ay'\n        return \"$word ay\"\n    end\n    prepend = word[1:first_consonant_index - 1]\n    append = word[first_consonant_index + 1 : end] * \"ay\"\n    return prepend * append\nend\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `pig_latinify` that transforms a vector of strings into their pig latin equivalents, with each transformation happening on a separate thread using the `@threads` macro. The `translate_to_pig_latin` function is used to perform the actual translation from English to Pig Latin.\n\nThe `findfirst` function is used to find the index of the first consonant in the word. If it does not exist (i.e., the word starts with a vowel or a space), then we simply append \"ay\" to the word. Otherwise, we prepend all the characters up to the first consonant and append everything else plus \"ay\".\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes that the input strings do not contain any non-English characters. If they do, you may need to adjust the `consonants` string or use a more sophisticated algorithm to determine which characters are vowels and which are consonants.\n\nTo test the function, you can run the following code:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"cat\", \"apple\", \"fish\", \"spaceship\"]\npig_latinified_words = pig_latinify(words)\nfor (original, translated) in zip(words, pig_latinified_words)\n    println(\"$original -> $translated\")\nend\n```\n\nThis will output the original words and their corresponding pig latin translations.","status":200,"tokens":[377,595],"elapsed":22.642006347,"_type":"aimessage"}]
