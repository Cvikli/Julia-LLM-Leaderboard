Here's how you could implement it:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strs::Vector{String})\n    # Initialize an output vector of strings\n    out_strs = Vector{String}(undef, length(strs))\n\n    # Spawn a thread for each string to translate it to Pig Latin\n    threads = [Threads.@spawn pig_latinify_thread(s) for s in strs]\n\n    # Wait for all threads to finish and collect the results\n    for thread in threads\n        out_strs[thread.id - 1] = take!(thread)\n    end\n\n    return out_strs\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_thread(str::String)\n    # Pig Latin translation rules:\n    #   - Add \"ay\" to the end of the word if it starts with a vowel.\n    #   - Move the first letter (or letters if a consonant cluster) to the end and add \"ay\".\n    chars = collect(str)\n    vowels = 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'\n    if chars[1] in vowels\n        return string(str[2:end], \"ay\")\n    else\n        consonants = findall(x -> x != ' ' && !(x in vowels), chars)\n        if isempty(consonants)\n            return str\n        else\n            front_part = string(chars[1])\n            back_part = string(chars[2:end-1])\n            return \"$back_part$front_partay\"\n        end\n    end\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nstrs = [\"Hello\", \"World\", \"Julia\"]\npig_latinified_strs = pig_latinify(strs)\nprintln(pig_latinified_strs)  # Output will be: [\"elloHay\", \"orldWay\", \"uliaJay\"]\n```\n\nIn this code, `pig_latinify` spawns a thread for each string in the vector using `Threads.@spawn` and stores them in a list of threads. Then it waits for all threads to finish by iterating over the list and collecting the results into an output vector.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_thread` function is where the actual translation takes place. It follows these rules:\n\n- If the word starts with a vowel, add \"ay\" to the end.\n- If the word starts with one or more consonants (a consonant cluster), move those consonants to the end and add \"ay\".\n\nPlease note that in this implementation, I've used `Threads.@spawn` without any additional synchronization because the function is purely functional and does not modify any shared state.
