[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The utility function `firstletter` is used to get the first letter of each word for the pig latin transformation. The resulting vector is returned.\n\nThe function works by iterating over the vector of strings in separate threads using `Threads.@threads`. Each thread performs the pig latin translation on its corresponding string, and then the results are collected back into a vector.\n\nPlease note that the actual translation logic to Pig Latin may require further refinement based on the rules of Pig Latin. The example provided here assumes that words beginning with 'q' should have 'u' appended after the original word, but this might not be accurate for all cases. Additionally, edge cases such as empty strings or strings containing non-alphabetic characters should also be considered.","status":200,"tokens":[0,546],"elapsed":15.402339276,"_type":"aimessage"}]
