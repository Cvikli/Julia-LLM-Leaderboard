The `async_pig_latinify` function uses `ThreadingUtilities.AsyncTask`s to create a separate asynchronous task for each string, which are then awaited and their results collected.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you have the `ThreadingUtilities` package installed. If you're using Julia v1.7 or later, you can replace the `Pkg` command with `using Pkg; Pkg.add(\"ThreadingUtilities\")` at the top of your script to install the package if it's not already installed.\n\nWhen you call `async_pig_latinify(texts)`, the function will start converting each string in texts asynchronously using separate threads, and once all tasks have completed, it will return a vector containing the resulting Pig Latin translations of the original strings.","status":200,"tokens":[69,761],"elapsed":25.498558193,"_type":"aimessage"}]
