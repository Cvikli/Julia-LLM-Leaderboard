It uses an auxiliary function `findfirst` from the standard library to locate the first vowel in the string, which determines how the transformation should proceed. The original string is divided into two parts: before the first vowel (considering 'y' as a consonant) and after the last vowel. The second part is moved to the beginning of the new string with \"ay\" appended, and the first part is prepended to it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,468],"elapsed":12.961425823,"_type":"aimessage"}]
