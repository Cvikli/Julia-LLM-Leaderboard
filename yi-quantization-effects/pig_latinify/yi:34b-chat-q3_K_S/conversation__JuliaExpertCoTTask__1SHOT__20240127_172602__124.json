It does this by splitting the word into its first letter and the rest, then concatenating them back together in the correct order for pig latin.\n\nThe `threaded_processor` function is used to run `process_word` on a separate thread for each word in the vector. This function uses the `ThreadPool.executor()` which provides a simple interface to execute tasks on a thread pool.\n\nFinally, we call `pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])` to demonstrate how the function works.","status":200,"tokens":[0,280],"elapsed":7.450433238,"_type":"aimessage"}]
