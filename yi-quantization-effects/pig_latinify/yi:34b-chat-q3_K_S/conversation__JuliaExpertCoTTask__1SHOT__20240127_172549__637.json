If the word starts with a vowel or is all punctuation/non-letters, it just appends \"ay\" to the end. The function uses `findfirst` from Base Julia to find the first non-vowel character and then builds the new pig latinified string accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[197,320],"elapsed":13.064552866,"_type":"aimessage"}]
