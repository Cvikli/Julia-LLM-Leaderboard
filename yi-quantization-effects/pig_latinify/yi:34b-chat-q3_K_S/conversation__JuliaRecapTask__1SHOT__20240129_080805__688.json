X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses the `Threads.@spawn` macro to spawn a new thread for each element in the input vector and then waits for all threads to finish before returning the result. The actual translation to pig latin is done inside a separate function `pig_latinify_threaded`, which is called by the main function with each string element assigned to it.\n\nThe function `split_on_vowels` is used to split the text into consonants and vowels based on a regular expression that matches English pronunciation rules. The first letter of the vowel part is prepended to the consonant part, and the remaining vowels are appended as a suffix, all joined together with \"ay\".\n\nThe `first_letter` function returns the first letter of a string without allocating an intermediate string, and `suffix` extracts the suffix of a string after the last occurrence of a vowel character.\n\nThe `split_on_vowels` function is used to split the text into consonants and vowels based on a regular expression that matches English pronunciation rules. The first letter of the vowel part is prepended to the consonant part, and the remaining vowels are appended as a suffix, all joined together with \"ay\".\n\nThe `pig_latinify_threaded` function performs the actual translation in each thread and then joins the resulting strings back into a single vector of strings. The `nthreads` parameter is used to specify how many threads should be used for the operation, and it defaults to the number of available threads on the system.\n\n### Performance Considerations\n\nNote that string operations in Julia can be costly due to their immutability. However, this function tries to minimize unnecessary allocations by using existing strings wherever possible and avoiding temporary string creation where appropriate (such as in `first_letter` and `suffix`). It also assumes that the input strings do not contain any null bytes (`\"\\0\"`), which would cause undefined behavior if encountered during slicing or indexing operations.","status":200,"tokens":[0,1085],"elapsed":30.769399479,"_type":"aimessage"}]
