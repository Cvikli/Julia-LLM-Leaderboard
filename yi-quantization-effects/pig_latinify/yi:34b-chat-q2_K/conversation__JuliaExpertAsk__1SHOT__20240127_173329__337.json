The transformation itself is left as a placeholder for you to implement. You can choose to run the iterations on separate threads by using `Threads.@spawn`, but note that in this simple case, Julia's type inference might not be able to infer the correct type of the output vector without explicit type annotations. The `pig_latinify` function itself should also return a string containing the translated text.\n\nHere's an example of how you might implement the actual translation logic for Pig Latin:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(text::String)\n    words = split(text, \" \")\n    pig_latinized_words = String[]\n    for word in words\n        if startswith(word, \"-\") || endswith(word, \"-\")\n            # Handle non-alpha characters separately for now\n            pig_latinized_words += [word]\n            continue\n        end\n        vowel_sound = true\n        if word[1] == 'h'\n            # Handle 'h' at the beginning of a word\n            word = \"$(word[2:])\"\n        elseif isletter(word[1])\n            vowel_sound = false\n        end\n        if !vowel_sound && length(word) > 1\n            # Add \"ay\" to the end of words that start with a consonant and have more than one letter\n            word *= \"ay\"\n        end\n        suffix = \"ay\"\n        if word[end] == 'y'\n            suffix = \"$(word[1:(end - 1))\" * \"ay\"\n            word = word[1:(end - 1)]\n        end\n        pig_latinized_words += [prefix(word) * suffix]\n    end\n    return join(pig_latinized_words, \" \")\nend\n```\n\nThis is one possible implementation of the Pig Latin transformation logic. Note that this translation rule does not cover all edge cases and special handling for non-English words or punctuation.","status":200,"tokens":[0,660],"elapsed":17.065280422,"_type":"aimessage"}]
