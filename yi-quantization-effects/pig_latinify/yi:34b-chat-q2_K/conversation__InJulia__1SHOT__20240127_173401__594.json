Here's how you could implement it:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(texts)\n    # Use an empty string as the destination vector\n    pig_latin_texts = Vector{String}(undef, length(texts))\n    @assert length(texts) > 0 \"No text provided\"\n\n    # Initialize a counter for thread-safe iteration\n    thread_idx = Threads.SpinLock()\n    threads_count = Threads.nthreads()\n\n    # Launch threads and perform the transformation in parallel\n    for i in eachindex(texts)\n        @async begin\n            Threads.lock(thread_idx)\n            local_i = i % threads_count + 1\n            pig_latin_texts[local_i] = pig_latinify(texts[local_i])\n            Threads.unlock(thread_idx)\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Wait for all the transformations to complete\n    while true\n        if !isempty(pig_latin_texts) || i == length(texts)\n            break\n        end\n        sleep(0.1) # Sleep for a short duration to allow threads to finish\n    end\n\n    return pig_latin_texts\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(text)\n    # Pig Latin translation logic goes here\n    # Example: \"Hello World\" would become \"ello Horlday\" in Pig Latin\n    pigLatinText = \"\"\n    for word in split(text)\n        wordStart = first(word)\n        if wordStart == 'h' || wordStart == 't' || wordStart == 's' || wordStart == 'a'\n            # Add the word to the string\n            pigLatinText += word[5:end] * \"ay\"\n        else\n            pigLatinText += wordStart * (wordStart > 'z') * (length(word) - 1) + word[2:end]\n        end\n    end\n    return pigLatinText\nend\n```\n\nThis function `pig_latinify` takes a vector of strings and returns another vector containing the corresponding Pig Latin translations. Each element is processed in its own thread, with a lock to ensure that the iteration happens safely across threads. The `pig_latinify` function itself does not use any threads but could be made parallel by modifying it appropriately if needed for a different scenario.\n\nPlease note that this code uses Julia 1.x syntax and features. If you are using an older version of Julia, some features might need to be adapted accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,635],"elapsed":16.367156517,"_type":"aimessage"}]
