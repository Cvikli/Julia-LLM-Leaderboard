The `pig_latin` function itself just rearranges the characters of a string according to the rules of Pig Latin. Here's how you would implement it:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(texts)\n    for text in texts\n        @async translate(String(text))\n    end\nend\n\nfunction translate(text)\n    # Pig latin translation logic here\n    # For example, \"Hello world\" would become \"ellooworlday\"\n    result = String[]\n    start_index = findfirst(c -> c == 'a' || c == 'e' || c == 'i' || c == 'o' || c == 'u', text)\n    if start_index !== nothing\n        # If first character is a vowel, add it to the result\n        result = vcat(text[1], result)\n        # Remove it from the original string and continue\n        text = sub(text, start_index + 1:)\n    end\n    for c in text\n        if c == ' ' || c == '-'\n            # Ignore spaces and dashes\n            continue\n        elseif isletter(c)\n            # Add to the result\n            result = vcat(c, result)\n        end\n    end\n    return join(result)\nend\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `pig_latinify` takes a vector of strings `texts` and passes each string to `translate` function.\n- `translate` first finds the index of the first vowel (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, or `u`) in the text, which indicates where the word starts. If the first character is a vowel, it prepends that character to the result, as Pig Latin puts the initial consonants at the end of the word.\n- It then iterates over the rest of the string, adding each non-space and non-dash character to the result. This handles the case where the first character is a consonant or a letter after a vowel.\n- Finally, it joins the result into a single Pig Latin translation.\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes you are using Julia 1.2 or later, as the `@async` macro was introduced in that version. Also, running `translate` on its own does not wait for the async job to finish; it just starts them and then returns immediately. You would need to use some form of synchronization if you want to wait for all threads to finish before proceeding with the next operation.\n\nIn practice, you might choose to write a more complex solution that collects results from each thread or uses `@sync` instead of `@async` if you want to block until all threads have finished.","status":200,"tokens":[0,641],"elapsed":16.524509298,"_type":"aimessage"}]
