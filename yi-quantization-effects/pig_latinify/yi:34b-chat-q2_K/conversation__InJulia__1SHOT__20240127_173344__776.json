To do this efficiently, we'll use `@threads` macro provided by Base Julia.\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(texts::Vector{String})\n    n = length(texts)\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, n)\n    @assert all([isascii(c) for c in Iterators.flatten(texts)]) \"Non-ASCII characters are not supported\"\n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:n\n        x = texts[i]\n        result[i] = pig_latinify_string(x)\n    end\n    return result\nend\n\n# Utility function to convert a single string to Pig Latin\nfunction pig_latinify_string(s::String)\n    chars = collect(s)\n    n = length(chars)\n    i = findfirst(' ', chars)\n    if i !== nothing\n        return String(chars[1:i-1]..., \"ay\", chars[i+1:end]...)\n    else\n        return String(chars[1:(n-1)]..., \"ay\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function works as follows:\n\n1. The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings `texts`.\n2. It checks using `all([isascii(c) for c in Iterators.flatten(texts)])` if all characters in the vector are ASCII, and throws an assertion error if not, because we require this for efficient parallel processing.\n3. The `Threads.@threads` macro is used to run the loop over each string in parallel using a separate thread.\n4. Inside the loop, the actual conversion of a single string to Pig Latin is done using the `pig_latinify_string` function.\n5. The resulting vector of Pig Latin strings is returned.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_string` utility function converts a single string to Pig Latin by looking for the first space character to split between the original word and \"ay\" suffix. If no space is found, it assumes that the entire string is a word with an implied space at the end and adds a space before appending \"ay\".\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes that each string does not contain any non-ASCII characters and does not check for edge cases such as empty strings or very long strings that might exceed the maximum length of a Julia string.","status":200,"tokens":[66,588],"elapsed":15.288825259,"_type":"aimessage"}]
