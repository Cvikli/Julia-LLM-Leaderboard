Since you have provided an example of what the input might be, I'll use your example in the testing below.\n\n```julia\n# Example usage and testing with the provided data:\ntexts = [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]\npig_latinified_texts = pig_latinify(texts)\n\nprintln(\"The transformed texts are:\")\nfor text in pig_latinified_texts\n    println(text)\nend\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it should output the following:\n\n```\nThe transformed texts are:\nhelloay\nappleay\nstrongtay\nworldway\n```\n\nPlease note that the actual transformation of words into pig latin is not trivial and requires a more complex algorithm than a simple substitution cipher. The example above demonstrates the structure of the code but does not accurately reflect the full complexity of transforming text into pig latin.","status":200,"tokens":[0,525],"elapsed":13.57244549,"_type":"aimessage"}]
