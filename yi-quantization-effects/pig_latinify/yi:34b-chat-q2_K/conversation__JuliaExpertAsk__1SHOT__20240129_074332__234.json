It uses futures and async tasks to achieve parallel processing of strings. The `chunks` function from the `Dates` package is used to divide the input vector into chunks, which are processed asynchronously in separate threads using `@async`. Finally, `gather_results` collects the results from the completed futures.","status":200,"tokens":[0,491],"elapsed":13.10920209,"_type":"aimessage"}]
