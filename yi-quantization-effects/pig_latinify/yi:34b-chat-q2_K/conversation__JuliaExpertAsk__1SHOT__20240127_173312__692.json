The `@threads` macro provided by Base allows iteration over the collection with each element being operated on by a separate thread. However, the actual implementation details of `@threads` can vary between Julia versions, so it's best to check the official documentation or release notes for any changes.","status":200,"tokens":[0,266],"elapsed":6.798978703,"_type":"aimessage"}]
