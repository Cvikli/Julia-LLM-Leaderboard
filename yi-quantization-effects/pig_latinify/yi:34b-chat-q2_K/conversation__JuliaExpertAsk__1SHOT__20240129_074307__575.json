It only demonstrates how you might structure such a function using `async` to run on separate threads. To translate strings into Pig Latin, you would need to implement the translation logic within the `pig_latinize` function and replace the placeholder code above with your actual translation algorithm.","status":200,"tokens":[108,250],"elapsed":10.778142921,"_type":"aimessage"}]
