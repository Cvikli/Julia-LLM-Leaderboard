[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses `@spawn` to spawn a task for each word on a separate thread, assuming that the number of threads is known or can be inferred from the system. The `wait` function is used to wait for the completion of each spawned task, ensuring that the result is collected before moving on to the next iteration.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_task` function itself breaks down a string into its first letter and the rest of the word using helper functions `firstletter` and `restofword`, then constructs the new pig latin form of the word by appending \"ay\" to the rest of the word preceded by the first letter. The `join` function is used to join all the words back into a single string with spaces in between.","status":200,"tokens":[0,605],"elapsed":15.822475007,"_type":"aimessage"}]
