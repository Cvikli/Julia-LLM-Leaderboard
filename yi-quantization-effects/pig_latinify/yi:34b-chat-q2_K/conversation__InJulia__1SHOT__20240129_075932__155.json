Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    # Use pmap to operate on each element in the vector with separate threads\n    return pmap(string -> _pig_latinify(string), strings)\nend\n\n# Helper function to convert a single string to Pig Latin\nfunction _pig_latinify(str::String)\n    # Example logic to convert str to pig latin (this does not fully handle every case)\n    parts = split(str, \" \")\n    out = []\n    for w in parts\n        if isuppercase(firstchar(w))\n            # Handle uppercase word - no transformation needed\n            push!(out, w)\n        else\n            vowel_sound = false\n            vowels = [\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"]\n            if ismember(w[1], vowels)\n                # If first char is a vowel, it's a vowel sound\n                vowel_sound = true\n            end\n            if !vowel_sound && w[1] == lowercase(w[1])\n                # Add to end of output if not a vowel sound and no transformation needed\n                push!(out, w)\n            else\n                # Transformation for Pig Latin: 'y' is a vowel, everything else moves to the end\n                if vowel_sound && w[1] == \"y\"\n                    w = replace(w, \"y\" => \"i\")  # Adjust the string if it starts with 'y' (a vowel in Pig Latin)\n                end\n                push!(out, join((vowel_sound ? \"\" : w[1]), w[2:end], \"\"))  # Join the pieces together with an empty separator\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return join(out, \" \")  # Re-join all the words in the sentence\nend\n\n# Utility function to get first character of a string\nfunction firstchar(str::String)\n    return str[1]\nend\n\n# Utility function to check if a string starts with a given substring\nfunction ismember(substr::String, str::String)\n    return substr == \"\" || substr == firstchar(str)\nend\n```\n\nPlease note that the above code is an example and may need adjustments based on your specific requirements for transforming strings into Pig Latin. It includes basic logic to handle words starting with vowels or consonants, but does not account for all edge cases (e.g., punctuation, capitalization). You might also want to add error handling for empty strings or invalid inputs.","status":200,"tokens":[0,671],"elapsed":18.019735335,"_type":"aimessage"}]
