Below is an example implementation using the `@async` macro to run each transformation in a separate task:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(texts::Vector{String})\n    for text in texts\n        @async begin\n            print(pig_latinify(text))\n            println()\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(text::String)\n    # Example of how to convert a string to Pig Latin:\n    # \"Hello world\" -> \"ello woldhay\"\n    # Remove leading vowels (a, e, i, o, u) and add \"ay\" at the end.\n    parts = split(text)\n    new_word = []\n    for part in parts\n        if isascii(part[1]) && isalpha(part[1])\n            if part[1] == 'h' || part[1] == 'r' || part[1] == 'l' || part[1] == 's' || part[1] == 't' || part[1] == 'w'\n                pushfirst!(new_word, part)\n            elseif isupper(part[1])\n                push!(new_word, lowercase(part)[2:end] * \"ay\")\n            else\n                push!(new_word, part)\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return join(new_word)\nend\n```\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings and applies the transformation to each element in parallel. The inner logic of the conversion from string to Pig Latin is also provided. Note that this implementation assumes a simplified version of Pig Latin where we only convert consonants at the beginning of the word followed by a vowel, and then add \"ay\" to the end of the word.\n\nWhen calling `pig_latinify`, ensure that you're not running it within another asynchronous block or on a different thread to avoid race conditions or incorrect output, especially when printing the results.","status":200,"tokens":[0,490],"elapsed":13.071624779,"_type":"aimessage"}]
