[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

If you need to handle edge cases where the first letter of a word is \"a\" and the word does not start with a vowel, please provide an example so I can update the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,243],"elapsed":6.228451398,"_type":"aimessage"}]
