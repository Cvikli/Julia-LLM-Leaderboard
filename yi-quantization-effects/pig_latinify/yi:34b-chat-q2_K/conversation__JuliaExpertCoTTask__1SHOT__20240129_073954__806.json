You would need to implement or provide the translation logic according to the rules of Pig Latin. The `pig_latinify` function assumes that each string in the vector will be processed independently, which is why it's important to understand how the `translate_piglatin` function works before proceeding with the implementation.","status":200,"tokens":[0,500],"elapsed":13.426619475,"_type":"aimessage"}]
