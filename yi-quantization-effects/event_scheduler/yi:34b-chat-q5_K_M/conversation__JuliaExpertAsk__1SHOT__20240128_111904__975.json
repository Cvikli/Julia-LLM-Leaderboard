It returns \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events, \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time, and \"No events\" if the list is empty. The `Dates` package is used for parsing the date strings into dates for comparison.","status":200,"tokens":[150,361],"elapsed":11.955190384,"_type":"aimessage"}]
