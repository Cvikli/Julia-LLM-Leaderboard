It then checks each event against all subsequent events by comparing their start times. If any event starts within 24 hours of another event's end, it indicates a conflict. The function returns \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events or \"Conflict\" if any overlap is detected. If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,298],"elapsed":9.715137899,"_type":"aimessage"}]
