[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

It then uses a nested loop to check for conflicts between events, ensuring that the finish time of one event does not overlap with the start time of another. If no conflicts are found, it returns \"No conflicts\"; otherwise, it returns \"Conflict\".\n\nThe `startswith` check is added to prevent circular references in the event list, which could lead to infinite loops or incorrect results.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes the input events do not contain any duplicates and are sorted by their start times for efficiency. If this assumption is not met, additional logic would be needed to handle such cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,720],"elapsed":23.879317027,"_type":"aimessage"}]
