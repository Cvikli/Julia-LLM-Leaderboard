It uses the `Dates` package for parsing the date strings into Date objects for accurate time comparison. The function iterates over all pairs of events, checking if there is an overlap between their start and finish times. If no conflict is found, it returns \"No conflicts\"; otherwise, it returns \"Conflict\". If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,305],"elapsed":9.945236997,"_type":"aimessage"}]
