It then sorts the events by their start times to ensure efficient checking. Using a sorted list, it iterates over each event starting from the second one (since the first event doesn't have a previous event to check against). For each event, it checks if the current event's start time is within an hour of the previous event's end time and vice versa. If there's an overlap, the function returns \"Conflict\"; otherwise, it continues until all events are checked and returns \"No conflicts\" if no conflicts were found.","status":200,"tokens":[0,342],"elapsed":11.157111013,"_type":"aimessage"}]
