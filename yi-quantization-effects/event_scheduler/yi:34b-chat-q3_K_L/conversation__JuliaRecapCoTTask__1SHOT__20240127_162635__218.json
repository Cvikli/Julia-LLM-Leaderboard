X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

The `event_scheduler` function iterates over all pairs of events and checks for time overlap using the `overlap_time` function. This function defines when an overlap occurs, considering both the start and finish times of each event.\n\nThe algorithm is designed to check for conflicts in the most efficient way by only comparing each event with subsequent ones. This is more efficient than comparing all pairs of events against each other, which would be O(n^2) in the worst case. The provided solution is O(n) in time complexity.\n\nGiven a list of events, the `event_scheduler` function will return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events do overlap in time. If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,579],"elapsed":16.262509327,"_type":"aimessage"}]
