[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

It uses the `Dates` package to parse the dates and times from the strings provided. The `map` function is used to convert each event into a pair of DateTime values for the start and finish times. These are then sorted by the start time to ensure that they are checked in order.\n\nThe main logic for checking conflicts occurs in a loop over all pairs of events, where the first event is compared with every subsequent event. If any overlap is found between the finish time of one event and the start time of another, the function returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, if no conflicts are found, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that all events have a unique start time, and it does not handle cases where multiple events start at exactly the same time. Also, the HH:MM format for specifying times is assumed to be in the 24-hour format without seconds or milliseconds.","status":200,"tokens":[11,491],"elapsed":13.859514546,"_type":"aimessage"}]
