It then converts these strings into `DateTime` objects using the `Dates` package for accurate time comparison. Afterward, it checks for any conflicts between each pair of events by comparing their start and end dates. If there's a conflict (i.e., if the finish time of one event is before the start time of another event), the function returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\". If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,346],"elapsed":9.57993293,"_type":"aimessage"}]
