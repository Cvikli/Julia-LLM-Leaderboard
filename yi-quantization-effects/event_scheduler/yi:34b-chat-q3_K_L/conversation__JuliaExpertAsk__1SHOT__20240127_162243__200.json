It sorts the events by their start time for efficient comparison. Then it iterates through the list, comparing the start time of each event to the end time of the previous one. If any overlap is detected, the function returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\". If the provided list is empty, the function returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,405],"elapsed":11.207446696,"_type":"aimessage"}]
