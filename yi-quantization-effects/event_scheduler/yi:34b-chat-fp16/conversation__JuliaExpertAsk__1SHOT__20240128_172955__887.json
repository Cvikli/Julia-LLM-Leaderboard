It uses the `Dates` package to parse the strings into `DateTime` objects for comparison. The algorithm iteratively checks if each event's start time is before the previous event's finish time and their finish times don't overlap. If there are no conflicts, it returns \"No conflicts\"; otherwise, it returns \"Conflict\". If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,427],"elapsed":33.169230592,"_type":"aimessage"}]
