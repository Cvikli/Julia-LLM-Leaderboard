It first sorts the events by their start time to make conflict checking easier. Then, it iterates over the sorted list and for each event, checks if it overlaps with the previous event. If no conflicts are found, the function returns \"No conflicts\". Otherwise, it returns \"Conflict\". If the list is empty, the function returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,355],"elapsed":27.544925628,"_type":"aimessage"}]
