For each event, it calculates the finish time by adding 24 hours minus the start hour and minute to the start time. It then checks if the event starts while another is active or if it overlaps with an existing event by comparing its finish time with the start times of previous events and its start time with the finish times of previous events. If there's a conflict, the function returns \"Conflict\"; otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\". If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,512],"elapsed":39.817078038,"_type":"aimessage"}]
