Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    for (i, e1) in enumerate(events)\n        start1, finish1 = DateTime.(e1)\n        for e2 in events[i+1:end]\n            start2, finish2 = DateTime.(e2)\n            if start1 <= start2 && finish2 <= finish1 || start2 <= start1 && finish1 <= finish2\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\n\n# Checking Correctness\n\nThe `event_scheduler` function iterates over each event in the list and checks for conflicts with subsequent events. It uses `DateTime` to parse the string dates and times provided, ensuring accurate time comparisons.
