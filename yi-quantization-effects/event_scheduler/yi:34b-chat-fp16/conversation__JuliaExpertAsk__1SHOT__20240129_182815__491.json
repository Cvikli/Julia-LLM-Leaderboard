It uses the `Dates` package to parse the start and finish times in the YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM format. The function returns \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events, \"Conflict\" with a list of conflicting event indices if any events overlap in time, and \"No events\" if the list is empty.","status":200,"tokens":[0,503],"elapsed":39.174979127,"_type":"aimessage"}]
