[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

We use the `Dates` package to parse the date and time strings into `Date` and `DateTime` objects, respectively.\n2. To check for conflicts, we create a vector of time ranges for each event by subtracting one hour from the start time and adding one hour to the finish time. This ensures that events are checked for overlap in a way that includes both the start and finish times (i.e., the range is inclusive).\n3. We then iterate over all pairs of events, checking for intersection between their respective time ranges. If any conflict is found, we return \"Conflict\" immediately.\n4. If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of events, we return \"No conflicts\".\n5. If the list of events is empty, we return \"No events\".\n\nNote: The `event_scheduler` function assumes that each event's finish time is strictly later than the start time. It also assumes that the provided dates and times are valid and can be parsed without issues by the `Dates` package.","status":200,"tokens":[0,576],"elapsed":45.027009577,"_type":"aimessage"}]
