It uses the `Dates` package to parse these strings into `Date` objects and then checks for intersection between all pairs of events to determine if there are any conflicts. If no conflicts are found, it returns \"No conflicts\"; otherwise, it returns \"Conflict\". If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,439],"elapsed":34.213558123,"_type":"aimessage"}]
