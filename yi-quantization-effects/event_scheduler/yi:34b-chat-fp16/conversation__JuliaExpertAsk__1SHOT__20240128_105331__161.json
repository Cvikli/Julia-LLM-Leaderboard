It then checks for any overlaps between the start and finish times of all pairs of events. If there is no overlap, it returns \"No conflicts\"; if there is at least one conflict, it returns \"Conflict\"; otherwise, if the list is empty, it returns \"No events\". The `Dates` package is used for parsing the dates and durations from the strings provided in the tuples.","status":200,"tokens":[0,409],"elapsed":31.767383654,"_type":"aimessage"}]
