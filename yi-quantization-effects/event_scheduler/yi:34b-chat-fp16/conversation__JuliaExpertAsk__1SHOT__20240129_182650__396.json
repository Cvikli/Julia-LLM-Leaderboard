It uses the `Dates` package for parsing the date strings into `DateTime` objects, which makes the time comparison easier. The function returns \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events, or a message indicating the conflict with the conflicting events listed. If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,623],"elapsed":48.56727486,"_type":"aimessage"}]
