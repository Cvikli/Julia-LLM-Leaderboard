It uses the `Dates` package to parse the dates. The events are sorted by their start time, and then we check each event's finish time against the current finish time, which is updated after processing each event. If at any point a new event's finish time falls before or on the current finish time, it indicates a conflict.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the events are listed in chronological order by start time and that there are no duplicate events with the same start and finish times. It also does not handle edge cases like events that start exactly at the end of another event or events with identical start and finish times.","status":200,"tokens":[150,469],"elapsed":36.4853599,"_type":"aimessage"}]
