Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    for i in 1:length(events)-1\n        event_start = Date(events[i][1]) + Hour(Events[i][2]:Minute(events[i][2]:Second(0))\n        event_finish = event_start + Hour(events[i][3]):Minute(events[i][4]):Second(59)\n        for j in i+1:length(events)\n            if Date(events[j][1]) ∈ (event_start, event_finish) || Date(events[j][2]) ∈ (event_start, event_finish)\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\n# Example Call\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\n\n# Checking the Solution\n\nThe solution checks for conflicts by iterating through each event and checking if its start or finish time overlaps with the start or finish times of any other event. If a conflict is found, \"Conflict\" is returned. If all events are checked without finding a conflict, \"No conflicts\" is returned. If the list is empty, \"No events\" is returned as per the task requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,402],"elapsed":31.322890882,"_type":"aimessage"}]
