It also checks only for conflicts within the next hour after the start of each event. If an event is scheduled more than an hour from now, it's considered a conflict because the scheduler cannot guarantee that no other event will be scheduled in the meantime.","status":200,"tokens":[0,602],"elapsed":46.866128691,"_type":"aimessage"}]
