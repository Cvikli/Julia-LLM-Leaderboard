The following function does this:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    # Check if there are any events\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    # Parse the start and finish times of each event into DateTime objects\n    event_times = [DateTime(start_time) => DateTime(finish_time) for (start_time, finish_time) in events]\n\n    # Check for conflicts by comparing adjacent intervals\n    conflicts = false\n    for i in 1:length(event_times)-1\n        if event_times[i][2] > event_times[i+1][1]  # Check if there's an overlap\n            conflicts = true\n            break\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return the result\n    conflicts ? \"Conflict\" : \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of events, where each event is a tuple containing its start and finish times in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`. It then parses these times into `DateTime` objects using the `Dates` package. It checks for conflicts by comparing the end time of one event with the start time of the next event. If there is a case where the end time of an event is before the start time of the next event, it means there's an overlap, and the function returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, if all events are non-overlapping, the function returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nIf you want to handle more complex scenarios (e.g., multiple overlapping events) or provide additional information about the conflicts, you might need a more sophisticated algorithm or data structure (like a binary search tree or interval tree) to efficiently check for conflicts among all event intervals. However, for this simple case where each event is non-overlapping with its neighbors, the above function should suffice.","status":200,"tokens":[0,469],"elapsed":36.482723982,"_type":"aimessage"}]
