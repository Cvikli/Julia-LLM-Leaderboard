Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

It sorts the events by their start time using `sort!` to ensure that we can efficiently check for conflicts by iterating over the list. For each event starting from the second one (since the first event has no previous event to conflict with), it checks if the current event starts before or at the end of the previous event. If so, there is a scheduling conflict, and the function returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it continues until all events have been checked. If no conflicts are found, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[150,324],"elapsed":25.186625051,"_type":"aimessage"}]
