It then parses these strings into `DateTime` objects using the `Dates` package. It iteratively checks if the start time of an event is before the finish time of the previous event, indicating a scheduling conflict. If no conflicts are found, it returns \"No conflicts\"; otherwise, it returns \"Conflict\".\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that all times provided are in the local time zone and that there are no issues with parsing the dates or handling different time zones. If your application requires more robust date parsing or if you expect events to span across midnight or involve multiple time zones, you will need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[120,410],"elapsed":11.101859059,"_type":"aimessage"}]
