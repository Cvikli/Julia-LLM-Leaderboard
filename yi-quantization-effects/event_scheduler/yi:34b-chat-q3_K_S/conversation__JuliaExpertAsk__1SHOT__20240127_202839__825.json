Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\n# Example usage:\nusing Dates\nevents = [(2023, 04, 15, 09, 00), (2023, 04, 16, 10, 00)] # Sample events list\nprintln(event_scheduler(events))\n\n# Output:\n# No conflicts\n```\n\n```julia\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{Int, Int, Int, Int, Int}})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    conflicts = false\n    for i in 1:length(events) - 1\n        for j in (i + 1):length(events)\n            # Check if there's a time overlap between event i and j\n            if Date(events[i][1], events[i][2], events[i][3]) <=\n                Date(events[j][1], events[j][2], events[j][3]) <=\n                Date(events[i][1], events[i][2], events[i][3] + 1) &&\n                Time(events[i][4], events[i][5]) <= Time(events[j][4], events[j][5]) <= Time(events[i][4], events[i][5] + 1)\n                conflicts = true\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    if conflicts\n        return \"Conflict\"\n    else\n        return \"No conflicts\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nPlease note that the `events` list is expected to be a vector of tuples, where each tuple contains the year (YYYY), month (MM), day (DD), hour (HH), and minute (MM) for an event.
