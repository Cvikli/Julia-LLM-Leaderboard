Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{Date, Date}})\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    for i in 1:length(events) - 1\n        for j in i + 1:length(events)\n            start_i = Date(parse(DateTime, string(events[i][1])))\n            finish_i = Date(parse(DateTime, string(events[i][2])))\n            start_j = Date(parse(DateTime, string(events[j][1])))\n            finish_j = Date(parse(DateTime, string(events[j][2])))\n\n            if start_i <= finish_j && start_j <= finish_i\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function loops through all the events and checks if any of them overlap with each other. If there's an overlap, it returns \"Conflict\"; otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\". The `Date` constructor is used to convert the strings into `Date` objects for comparison. The `parse(DateTime, ...)` function from the `Dates` package is used to parse the date and time strings into `DateTime` objects.","status":200,"tokens":[0,307],"elapsed":8.149791875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
