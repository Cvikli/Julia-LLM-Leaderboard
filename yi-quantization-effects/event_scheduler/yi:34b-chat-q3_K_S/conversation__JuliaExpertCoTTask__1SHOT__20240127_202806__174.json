Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n\nFirst, we need to parse the dates and times into `DateTime` objects for comparison. Then, we can iterate over the events and check for overlaps using `DateTime`'s `<` and `>` operators.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    for (start1, finish1) in events\n        # Check for conflicts with other events\n        for (start2, finish2) in events[2:end]\n            if start2 <= start1 && finish1 >= finish2  # Overlap condition\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nNow we can test our function with the provided data:\n\n```julia\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```plaintext\n\"Conflict\"  # Since the second event overlaps with the first one.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,310],"elapsed":8.333304735,"_type":"aimessage"}]
