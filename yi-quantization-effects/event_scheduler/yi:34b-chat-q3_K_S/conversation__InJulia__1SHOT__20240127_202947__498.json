[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

It then sorts the events by their start time for efficient conflict checking. It iterates through the list and checks if any event ends before the next one starts. If not, it returns \"No conflicts\"; otherwise, it returns \"Conflict\".\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the input dates are formatted correctly according to the `Dates` package's expectations for parsing. The sorting step might be unnecessary if you have a more efficient algorithm in mind, but for a small number of events, this simple approach should suffice.","status":200,"tokens":[0,437],"elapsed":11.658689304,"_type":"aimessage"}]
