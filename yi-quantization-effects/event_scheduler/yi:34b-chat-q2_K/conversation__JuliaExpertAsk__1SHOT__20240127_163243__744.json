Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    for i in 2:length(events)\n        # Check if the current event starts before or finishes after a previous event\n        start1, finish1 = parse_event(events[i - 1])\n        start2, finish2 = parse_event(events[i])\n        if start1 <= finish2 || finish1 >= start2\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\nfunction parse_event((start, finish))\n    start_date = Date(start)\n    finish_date = Date(finish)\n    return (start_date, finish_date)\nend\n```\n\nPlease note that this function assumes the input events are in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` and that there is a valid time zone or offset associated with these dates.
