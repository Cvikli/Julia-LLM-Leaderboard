Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Julia Code\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    for i in 2:length(events)\n        event_start = Date(events[i][1])\n        event_finish = Date(events[i][2])\n        prev_event_end = Date(events[i - 1][2])\n\n        if event_start <= prev_event_end\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\n# Explanation\n\nThe `event_scheduler` function iterates over the list of events and checks if the start time of any event is before the end time of the previous event. If not, it returns \"No conflicts\". If there are no events, it returns \"No events\". The loop starts from the second element because the first one sets the initial state (the beginning of the iteration).\n\nThe `Date` function from the `Dates` package is used to parse strings into `Date` objects for comparison.","status":200,"tokens":[0,264],"elapsed":6.763195786,"_type":"aimessage"}]
