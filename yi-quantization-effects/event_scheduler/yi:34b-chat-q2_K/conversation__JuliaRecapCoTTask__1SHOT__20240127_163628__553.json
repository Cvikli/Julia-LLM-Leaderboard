[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates: Date, Time, formatdatetime, now, Hour, Minute, Second, Millisecond, Microsecond, Nanosecond, FormatSpec\nimport Base: ==, >, <\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    earliest_start = formatdatetime(first(events).starttime)\n    latest_finish = formatdatetime(last(events).finishtime)\n    conflict = false\n    for e in events[2:end]\n        if e.starttime <= latest_finish && earliest_start <= e.finishtime\n            conflict = true\n            break\n        end\n        earliest_start = min(earliest_start, e.starttime)\n        latest_finish = max(latest_finish, e.finishtime)\n    end\n    if !conflict\n        return \"No conflicts\"\n    else\n        return \"Conflict\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nPlease note that the `events` list should be defined as a custom type with fields for start and finish times, like so:\n\n```julia\nstruct Event\n    starttime::Date\n    finishtime::Date\nend\n```\n\nAnd you will need to parse your list of events into this format.
