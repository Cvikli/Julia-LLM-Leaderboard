Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    conflicts = false\n    for i in 1:length(events)-1\n        event_start_i = DateTime(events[i][1])\n        event_finish_i = DateTime(events[i][2])\n\n        for j in i+1:length(events)\n            event_start_j = DateTime(events[j][1])\n            event_finish_j = DateTime(events[j][2])\n\n            # Check for overlap\n            if (event_start_i <= event_start_j && event_start_j < event_finish_i) ||\n               (event_start_j <= event_start_i && event_start_i < event_finish_j)\n                conflicts = true\n                break\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    if conflicts\n        return \"Conflict\"\n    else\n        return \"No conflicts\"\n    end\nend\n\n# Example usage with provided data\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\n\n# Checking the Solution\n\nThe provided `event_scheduler` function follows the steps outlined for solving the task. It first checks if there are any events by iterating over the vector of tuples representing the events. For each event, it converts the start and finish times into `DateTime` objects using the `Dates` package for accurate parsing.\n\nNext, it checks for conflicts by comparing the start and finish times of each event with those of all subsequent events. If there is an overlap between any two events, a conflict is detected, and the function returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, if no conflicts are found, the function returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nThe example usage provided with the data demonstrates that there is indeed a conflict between the second event (starting at 11:30) and the first event (finishing at 11:00) since they overlap in time. Therefore, the output should be \"Conflict\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,558],"elapsed":17.970854224,"_type":"aimessage"}]
