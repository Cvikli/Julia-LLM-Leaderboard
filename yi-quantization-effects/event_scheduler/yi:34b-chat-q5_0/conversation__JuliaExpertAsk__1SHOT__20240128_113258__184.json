It uses the `Dates` package to parse these strings into `Date` objects for comparison. The function then checks each pair of events for overlapping time periods using a nested loop. If there is no overlap, it returns \"No conflicts\"; if there is a conflict, it returns \"Conflict\"; and if the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,316],"elapsed":10.052187363,"_type":"aimessage"}]
