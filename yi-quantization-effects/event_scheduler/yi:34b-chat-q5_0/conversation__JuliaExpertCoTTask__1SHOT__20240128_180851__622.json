It also only checks for consecutive events as specified in the task, which might be a limitation depending on the specific requirements. If non-consecutive events need to be checked, the inner loop should iterate over all events regardless of their position in the list.","status":200,"tokens":[0,371],"elapsed":11.905158615,"_type":"aimessage"}]
