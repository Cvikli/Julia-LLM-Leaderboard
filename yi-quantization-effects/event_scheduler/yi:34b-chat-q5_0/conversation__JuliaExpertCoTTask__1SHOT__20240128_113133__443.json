Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If not, it returns \"No events\". Otherwise, it loops through each event and checks for conflicts with subsequent events by comparing their start and finish times using `DateTime` objects for accurate time parsing. If a conflict is found, the function returns \"Conflict\"; otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,379],"elapsed":12.171440205,"_type":"aimessage"}]
