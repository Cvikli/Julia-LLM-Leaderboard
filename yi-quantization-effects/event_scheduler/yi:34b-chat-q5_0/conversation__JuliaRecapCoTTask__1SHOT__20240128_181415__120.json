[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

Then, we check for conflicts by iterating over all pairs of events, ensuring that there is no overlap in time using the `isconflict` function. If any conflict is found, we return \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found, we return \"No conflicts\".\n\nPlease note that this code assumes the input events are formatted correctly and do not contain any malformed strings that could lead to errors during parsing. Also, the check for conflicts does not take into account the specific duration of each event; it only checks if there is a time interval where both events' start and finish times overlap. If more precise conflict checking is required, additional logic would need to be added.","status":200,"tokens":[0,728],"elapsed":23.573061907,"_type":"aimessage"}]
