Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If such a conflict is found, the message \"Conflict\" is returned. Otherwise, the message \"No conflicts\" is returned.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the start time of an event cannot be greater than its finish time, as the dates are being converted to `Date` objects without considering the times. If such a case is possible in your scenario, additional checks would be needed to handle it correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,412],"elapsed":13.244151176,"_type":"aimessage"}]
