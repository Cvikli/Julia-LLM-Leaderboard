It uses the `Dates` package to parse the strings into `DateTime` objects for accurate comparison. The function iteratively checks each event against all subsequent events to determine if there are any overlaps in time. If no conflicts are found, it returns \"No conflicts\"; otherwise, it returns \"Conflict\". If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".\n\nThe `event_scheduler` function does not handle edge cases such as events with identical start and finish times or events that occur in the future (e.g., after 2038). It also assumes that the input dates and times are valid and formatted correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,421],"elapsed":13.538180736,"_type":"aimessage"}]
