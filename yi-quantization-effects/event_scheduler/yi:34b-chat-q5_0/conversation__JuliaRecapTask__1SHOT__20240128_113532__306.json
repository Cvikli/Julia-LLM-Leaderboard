[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

Each event is a tuple containing a start time and a finish time in string format. We use the `Dates` package to parse the dates and times into Julia's Date and Time types for comparison.\n\nThe function iterates over all pairs of events, comparing the finish time of one event with the start time of the next event. If there is an overlap between the end of one event and the beginning of another, we return \"Conflict\". Otherwise, we return \"No conflicts\" if the list is not empty. If the list is empty, we return \"No events\".\n\nThe `DateDiff` function calculates the difference in time between two dates, and we check if this difference is less than zero to determine if there's an overlap (since a negative value would mean that the second event starts before the first one ends).\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how the function works with a list of events and prints out the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,523],"elapsed":16.925280946,"_type":"aimessage"}]
