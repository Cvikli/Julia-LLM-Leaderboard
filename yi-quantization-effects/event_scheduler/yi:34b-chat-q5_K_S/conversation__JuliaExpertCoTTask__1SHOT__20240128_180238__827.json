Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    start_times = Date.(collect(map(x -> x[1], events)), format=\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n    finish_times = Date.(collect(map(x -> x[2], events)), format=\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n\n    conflicts = findall(Date.==, start_times, finish_times)\n    if length(conflicts) == 0\n        return \"No conflicts\"\n    else\n        return \"Conflict\"\n    end\nend\n\n# Example Call\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of tuples representing events and checks for conflicts by comparing the start times with the finish times.
