Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    # Convert strings to DateTime objects for comparison\n    event_dates = [DateTime.(event) for event in events]\n    \n    # Check for conflicts by comparing start and finish times of each event with others\n    for i in 1:length(events)\n        for j in (i+1):length(events)\n            if isoverlapping(event_dates[i][1], event_dates[j][1]) || isoverlapping(event_dates[i][2], event_dates[j][2])\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # No conflicts found\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\n# Example call with provided data\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\n\n# Checking the Solution\n\nThe `event_scheduler` function first checks if there are any events. If not, it returns \"No events\". If there are events, it converts the string dates into DateTime objects for accurate comparison using the `Dates` package. It then checks each event's start and finish times against all other events to see if there is an overlap. If no conflicts are found, the function returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nWhen we call `event_scheduler` with the provided data, it should return \"Conflict\" because the second event (starting at 11:30) overlaps with the finish time of the first event (ending at 11:00).","status":200,"tokens":[313,456],"elapsed":21.751609244,"_type":"aimessage"}]
