[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

If not, it returns \"No events\". Otherwise, it converts the tuples into an array of `EventTime` structs and sorts them by start time and then finish time to ensure a stable order. It then iterates over all pairs of consecutive events in the sorted order and checks for conflicts using the `isconflict` function. If any conflict is found, it returns \"Conflict\"; otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\". The `EventTime` struct holds both the start and finish times of an event for easy comparison, and the `isconflict` function checks if the finish time of one event is greater than or equal to the start time of another event, and vice versa, to determine if there's an overlap.","status":200,"tokens":[0,538],"elapsed":17.40783623,"_type":"aimessage"}]
