[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Uses `SortedSet` to ensure that each start and finish time is unique, which speeds up the conflict check later on.\n2. Parses the `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` strings into `DateTime` objects using `Dates`.\n3. Checks for conflicts by iterating over the start times and checking if any of them are also in the finish times, indicating an overlap. It then does the same for the finish times against the start times.\n4. If a conflict is found, it returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n5. If the list of events is empty, it returns \"No events\".\n\nTo use this function, you would call it like so:\n\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2023-01-01 09:00\", \"2023-01-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-01-01 12:00\", \"2023-01-01 14:00\")]\nresult = event_scheduler(events)\nprintln(result) # Output will be either \"No conflicts\" or \"Conflict\" depending on the events provided.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,642],"elapsed":20.778598651,"_type":"aimessage"}]
