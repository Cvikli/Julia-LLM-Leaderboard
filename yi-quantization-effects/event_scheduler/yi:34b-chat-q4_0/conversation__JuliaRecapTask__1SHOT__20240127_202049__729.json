[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

We first check if there are any events at all. If not, we return an empty string.\n\n2. We sort the events by start time to make it easier to check for conflicts.\n\n3. We initialize an empty set `active_ids` that will hold the currently active event ids.\n\n4. For each event tuple, we check if there are any active events (events whose start times are not yet expired). If not, we parse the dates and times into `DateTime` objects for easier comparison.\n\n5. We then iterate over the set of active event ids and check if the new event's finish time doesn't conflict with any of them. If a conflict is found, we return \"Conflict\" immediately.\n\n6. If there is no conflict, we add the start time of the current event to the set of active ids.\n\n7. We continue this process until all events have been checked. If no conflicts are found, we return \"No conflicts\".\n\n8. The function `active_end_time` is a placeholder for a function that would return the finish time corresponding to an active id. In our example, since we only need to check for conflicts at the start of each event, we don't actually need this function. However, if the events were not already sorted by start time, we would need to keep track of the end times as well, and this is where `active_end_time` would be used.\n\nThis solution assumes that the list of events is correctly formatted and that there are no edge cases like events with the same start or finish time. If such scenarios are possible, additional logic would need to be added to handle them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,863],"elapsed":23.421467396,"_type":"aimessage"}]
