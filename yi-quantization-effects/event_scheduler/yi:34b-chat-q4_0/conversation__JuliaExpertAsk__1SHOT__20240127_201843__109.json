It also assumes that all times are given in the same time zone, as the `DateTime` constructor used here does not automatically adjust for time zones. If you need to handle different time zones or more complex scheduling scenarios, you would need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,541],"elapsed":14.444654684,"_type":"aimessage"}]
