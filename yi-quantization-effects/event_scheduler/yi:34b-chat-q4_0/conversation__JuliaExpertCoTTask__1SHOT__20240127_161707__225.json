Import the `Dates` package for parsing date strings into dates and times.\n2. Define a function `event_scheduler` that takes a list of events, each event being a tuple of two strings representing start and finish times.\n3. Parse each event's start and finish times into `DateTime` objects using `Dates.parse`.\n4. Iterate over the list of events, checking for conflicts with the following logic:\n   - For each event, check if there is another event whose start time is greater than or equal to this event's start time AND whose finish time is less than or equal to this event's finish time.\n   - If such a conflict is found, return \"Conflict\".\n   - If all events are checked without finding any conflicts, return \"No conflicts\".\n5.
