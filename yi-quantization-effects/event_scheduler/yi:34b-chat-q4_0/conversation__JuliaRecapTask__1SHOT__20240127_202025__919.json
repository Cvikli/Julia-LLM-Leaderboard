[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

We start by importing the `Dates` package to handle date and time parsing.\n\n2. The function `event_scheduler` takes a vector of tuples, where each tuple represents an event with its start and finish times in the specified format.\n\n3. We check if the list is empty; if so, we return \"No events\" as instructed.\n\n4. We use a boolean to track whether it's the first iteration of the loop because we need to remember the finish time of the previous event for comparison with the start times of the subsequent events.\n\n5. In each iteration, we check if the current start time is before the finish time of the previous event; if so, we have a conflict and return \"Conflict\" immediately.\n\n6. If all events are checked without finding any conflicts, we return \"No conflicts\".\n\n7. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with an example list of events.","status":200,"tokens":[431,462],"elapsed":12.740850369,"_type":"aimessage"}]
