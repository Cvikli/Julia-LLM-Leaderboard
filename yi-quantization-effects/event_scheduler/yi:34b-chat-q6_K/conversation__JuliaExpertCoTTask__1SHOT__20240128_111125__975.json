The function `event_scheduler` takes a list of tuples representing events and returns \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events, \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time, and \"No events\" if the list is empty.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    earliest = minimum([start for start, finish in events])\n    latest = maximum([finish for start, finish in events])\n\n    for (i, (start, finish)) in enumerate(events[2:end])\n        if start < latest && finish > earliest\n            # Check if the current event overlaps with any previous ones\n            for (j, (s, f)) in enumerate(events[1:(i-1)])\n                if !((f <= start || s >= finish) || (f == Dates.Inf || s == Dates.Inf))\n                    return \"Conflict\"\n                end\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\n\nThis function works by finding the earliest start time and latest finish time among all events. It then checks each event in turn against all previous events to see if there is an overlap. If no conflicts are found, \"No conflicts\" is returned; otherwise, \"Conflict\" is returned. If the list of events is empty, \"No events\" is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[313,436],"elapsed":24.506012089,"_type":"aimessage"}]
