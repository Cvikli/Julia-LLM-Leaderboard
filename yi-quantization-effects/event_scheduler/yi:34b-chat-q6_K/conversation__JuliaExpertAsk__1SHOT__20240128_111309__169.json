It uses the `Dates` package to parse the dates and times. The function checks for scheduling conflicts by iterating over all pairs of events (i.e., one event at a time compared to all subsequent events). If there are no conflicts, it returns \"No conflicts\"; otherwise, it returns \"Conflict\". If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,313],"elapsed":11.629536769,"_type":"aimessage"}]
