[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

It uses `DateFormat` to ensure correct parsing of the date and time strings.\n- The `event_scheduler` function first checks for parsing errors and then iterates over each event, checking for conflicts with previously scheduled events using a nested loop. If no conflict is found, the event is added to the list of scheduled events.\n- After scheduling all events, the function checks for conflicts among the scheduled events by comparing the start and finish times of each pair of events.\n- The `Event` struct is used to hold the parsed event details, with a custom `show` method to print the event in a human-readable format.\n- The test at the end demonstrates how the function should work with an example list of events.","status":200,"tokens":[431,1066],"elapsed":40.638487728,"_type":"aimessage"}]
