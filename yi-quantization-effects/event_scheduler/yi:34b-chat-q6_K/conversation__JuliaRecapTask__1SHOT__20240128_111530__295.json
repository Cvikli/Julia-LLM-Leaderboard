[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

It then checks for scheduling conflicts by iterating over all events, comparing each event's start and finish time with the start and finish times of subsequent events in the list. If there is any overlap between a pair of events, the function returns \"Conflict\". If no such conflict is found, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nThe outer loop iterates over the events, and within each iteration, we check if the current event (event1) overlaps with any of the remaining events in the list (event2) using the `in` operator to ensure that we don't compare an event with itself. If there is no overlap, we continue to the next event.\n\nIf the list of events is empty, we return \"No events\" to indicate that there are no events to schedule.","status":200,"tokens":[0,349],"elapsed":13.139026935,"_type":"aimessage"}]
