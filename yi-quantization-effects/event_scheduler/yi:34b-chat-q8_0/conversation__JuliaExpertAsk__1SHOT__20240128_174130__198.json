It first checks if there are any events at all, returning an appropriate message if not. Then it sorts the events by their start time using `sort` with a custom comparison function that parses the dates using `DateTime`.\n\nAfter sorting, the function iterates over the events, checking at each step if the current event's start time is before the end of the previous event. If so, there's a conflict, and the function returns \"Conflict\". If not, it continues to check for conflicts with the next event.\n\nIf no conflicts are found after checking all events, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,382],"elapsed":17.200588434,"_type":"aimessage"}]
