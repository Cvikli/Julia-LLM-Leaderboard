It then parses these strings into `DateTime` objects using the `Dates` package's `DateTime(string; format=\"format_str\")` method.\n\nA dictionary is used to store each unique start and finish time as a key with its corresponding `DateTime` object as the value. This allows for efficient checking of conflicts by iterating over the dictionary instead of the original list.\n\nThe function then checks for conflicts by comparing the start times of all events with their respective finish times, as well as the finish times of all other events. If there is a start time that occurs before or at the same time as another event's finish time, or if a finish time occurs after or at the same time as another event's start time, then there is a conflict.\n\nIf no conflicts are found, the function returns \"No conflicts\". Otherwise, it returns \"Conflict\". If the list of events is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,550],"elapsed":24.819067182,"_type":"aimessage"}]
