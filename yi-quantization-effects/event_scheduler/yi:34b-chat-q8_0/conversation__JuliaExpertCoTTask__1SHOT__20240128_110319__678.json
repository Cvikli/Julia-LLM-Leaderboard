Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

If not, it returns \"No events\". If there are events, it sorts them by start time to simplify the checking process. Then, for each event starting from the second one (since the first event cannot conflict with itself), it checks if the current event starts before the end of the previous event. If so, a conflict is detected and \"Conflict\" is returned.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates that there are no conflicts among the provided events, hence \"No conflicts\" is printed as output.","status":200,"tokens":[313,470],"elapsed":31.129531784,"_type":"aimessage"}]
