Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If no conflicts are found, it returns \"No conflicts\". If a conflict is detected, it returns \"Conflict\". If the list of events is empty, it returns \"No events\". The function uses `start_time` and `finish_time` tuples for each event and compares them to ensure no time overlap.\n\n# Output\n\n```text\n\"No conflicts\"","status":200,"tokens":[300,386],"elapsed":11.270689586,"_type":"aimessage"}]
