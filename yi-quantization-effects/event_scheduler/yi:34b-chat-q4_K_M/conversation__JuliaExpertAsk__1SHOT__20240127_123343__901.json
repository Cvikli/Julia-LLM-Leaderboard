It returns \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events, \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time, and \"No events\" if the list is empty. The `isoverlapping` function is used to check if two events overlap in time by comparing their start and finish times.","status":200,"tokens":[0,362],"elapsed":10.260614269,"_type":"aimessage"}]
