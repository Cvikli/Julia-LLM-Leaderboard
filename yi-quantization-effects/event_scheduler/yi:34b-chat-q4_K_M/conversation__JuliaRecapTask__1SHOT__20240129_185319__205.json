[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

It then uses `Dates` to parse the dates and times into `DateTime` objects for easier comparison. A boolean array `occupied_times` is created to track which time slots are occupied by events. The `start_time` of each event is marked as occupied, and then the occupied status is propagated to all subsequent days until the `finish_time` of the event.\n\nAfter marking all occupied time slots, the function checks for conflicts by finding non-empty entries in the `occupied_times` array. If there are no conflicts, it returns \"No conflicts\"; otherwise, it returns \"Conflict\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,642],"elapsed":19.004043081,"_type":"aimessage"}]
