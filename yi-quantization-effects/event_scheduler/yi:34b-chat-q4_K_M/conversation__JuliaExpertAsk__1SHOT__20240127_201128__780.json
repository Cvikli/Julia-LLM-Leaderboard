It uses the `Dates` package for parsing the dates. The function checks for scheduling conflicts by comparing the start and end times of each event with all other events in the list. If there is any overlap, it returns \"Conflict\"; otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\". If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[150,258],"elapsed":7.475382787,"_type":"aimessage"}]
