If a conflict is found, the function returns \"Conflict\". If all events can be scheduled without overlap, it returns \"No conflicts\". If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\". The `Dates` package is used for parsing the date and time strings into `DateTime` objects for comparison.","status":200,"tokens":[0,544],"elapsed":15.878021687,"_type":"aimessage"}]
