It uses the `Dates` package to parse the dates and times. The function creates a dictionary where the keys are the start times of the events, and the values are sets of finish times for each event that starts at that time. If there is more than one finish time for a given start time, it indicates a conflict.","status":200,"tokens":[0,371],"elapsed":10.763105216,"_type":"aimessage"}]
