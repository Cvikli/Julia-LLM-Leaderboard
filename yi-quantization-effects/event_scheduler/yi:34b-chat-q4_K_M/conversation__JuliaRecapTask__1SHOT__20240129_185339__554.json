[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

If the list of events is empty, it returns \"No events\".\n2. It converts each event's start and finish times into `DateTime` objects for comparison purposes using `format` to parse the strings in a standard way.\n3. It then checks if any event starts before the previous event finishes by comparing the dates of the current event with the finishes of all events that come before it. If such a conflict is found, \"Conflict\" is returned.\n4. If no conflicts are found, \"No conflicts\" is returned.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that each event is represented as a tuple containing its start and finish times in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'. It also requires the `Dates` package to parse the dates and times.","status":200,"tokens":[0,380],"elapsed":11.231983707,"_type":"aimessage"}]
