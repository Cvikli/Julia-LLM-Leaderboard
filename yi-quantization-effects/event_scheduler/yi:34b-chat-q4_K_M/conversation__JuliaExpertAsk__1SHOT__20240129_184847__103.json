It first checks if there are any events at all, returning \"No events\" if the list is empty. If there are events, it sorts them by their start times using the `sort` function with a custom sort order specified by the `by` keyword argument.\n\nThe main loop iterates over the sorted list of events starting from the second event (index 2) because the first event doesn't have a preceding event to check for conflicts with. For each event, it compares its start time to the finish time of the previous event. If there is an overlap, the function returns \"Conflict\".\n\nIf no conflict is found after checking all events against their predecessors, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,388],"elapsed":11.309335704,"_type":"aimessage"}]
