Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    for i in 1:length(events)-1\n        for j in i+1:length(events)\n            start_i = Date(events[i][1])\n            finish_i = Date(events[i][2])\n            start_j = Date(events[j][1])\n            finish_j = Date(events[j][2])\n\n            if start_i <= finish_j && start_j <= finish_i\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nevents = [(\"2023-04-15 09:00\", \"2023-04-15 11:00\"), (\"2023-04-15 10:00\", \"2023-04-15 12:00\")]\nprint(event_scheduler(events))  # Output should be \"Conflict\" because the events overlap.\n```\n\nThis function iterates over all possible pairs of events and checks if any start time is before another event's finish time, indicating a conflict.
