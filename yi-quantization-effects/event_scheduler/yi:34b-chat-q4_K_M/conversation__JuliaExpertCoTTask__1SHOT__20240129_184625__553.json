Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

We'll use the `Dates` package for parsing the dates and times.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    # Check if there are any events to schedule\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    # Create a dictionary with the start and finish times of each event\n    event_times = Dict()\n    for (start, finish) in events\n        start_time = Date(start) + Hour(9)  # Assuming all days start at 9 AM\n        finish_time = Date(finish) + Hour(23)  # Assuming all days end at 11 PM\n        event_times[start] = finish_time\n    end\n\n    # Check for conflicts by comparing the finish times of each event with the start times of the following events\n    for i in 1:length(events) - 1\n        if event_times[events[i][1]] < Date(events[i+1][0]) + Hour(9)  # If the current event's finish time is before the next event's start time, there's a conflict\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if there are any events to schedule. If not, it returns \"No events\". For each event, it creates a dictionary with the start and finish times of that event, assuming all days start at 9 AM and end at 11 PM for simplicity. It then checks for conflicts by comparing the finish time of each event with the start time of the following event. If there's a conflict (i.e., if the current event's finish time is before the next event's start time), it returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\n# Testing\n\nLet's test the function with the provided data:\n\n```julia\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\n\nThe output should be \"Conflict\" because the second event's start time overlaps with the first event's finish time.","status":200,"tokens":[0,627],"elapsed":18.567833072,"_type":"aimessage"}]
