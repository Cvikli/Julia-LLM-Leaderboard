[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

It then sorts the events by their start time to ensure a systematic comparison. The `ongoing_events` dictionary is used to keep track of which events are currently ongoing, with a value of 1 indicating an event is starting or ongoing, and 0 indicating it has finished.\n\nThe function iterates over each event in the sorted list. For each event, it checks if there is an ongoing event that overlaps with it (by comparing the start time of the current event to the finish times of previous events). If such a conflict is found, the function returns \"Conflict\" immediately.\n\nFinally, after iterating over all events, the function returns \"No conflicts\" if no overlap was detected. If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\" as instructed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,490],"elapsed":14.453987585,"_type":"aimessage"}]
