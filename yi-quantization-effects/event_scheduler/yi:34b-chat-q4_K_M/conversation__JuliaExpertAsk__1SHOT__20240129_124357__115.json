It uses the `Dates` package to parse the dates and create a dictionary where each key is an event's start time, and the value is the end time plus one minute to ensure there's no overlap with the next event.\n\nThe function then checks for conflicts by iterating over each start time and checking if it overlaps with any other event. If a conflict is found, the function returns `\"Conflict\"`. If no conflicts are found, it returns `\"No conflicts\"`. If there are no events in the list, it returns `\"No events\"`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,433],"elapsed":12.607939635,"_type":"aimessage"}]
