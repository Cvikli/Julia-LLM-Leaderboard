[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

It then checks for conflicts using the `isintersecting` function, which is a set operation that returns true if there is an intersection between two sets represented as arrays. In this case, we're checking if the start time of each event intersects with the finish time of any previous event or the start time of any subsequent event (excluding the end of the list).\n\nIf there are no events in the list, the function returns \"No events\". If there is at least one event but they do not overlap, the function returns \"No conflicts\".
