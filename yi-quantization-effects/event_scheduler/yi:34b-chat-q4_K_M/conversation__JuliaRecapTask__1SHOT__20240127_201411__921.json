[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

Imports the `Dates` package for parsing date strings into `DateTime` objects.\n2. Defines a function `parse_event` that parses an event string into a tuple of `DateTime` values.\n3. Defines a function `event_scheduler` that checks for scheduling conflicts among a list of events. It does this by iterating over each event and checking if it overlaps with any other event using the `isoverlapping` function.\n4. Defines a helper function `isoverlapping` to check if two events overlap in time. This is done by comparing the start and finish times of the events.\n5. An example usage demonstrates how to parse the given event strings into tuples of `DateTime` values and then call the `event_scheduler` function with those parsed events.\n6. Finally, it prints out the result of the scheduling check.\n\nPlease note that this script assumes the provided events are correctly formatted as tuples of start and finish times in the specified format ('YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). If the event strings are not in this format, the `parse_event` function will need to be adjusted accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[431,757],"elapsed":22.156863332,"_type":"aimessage"}]
