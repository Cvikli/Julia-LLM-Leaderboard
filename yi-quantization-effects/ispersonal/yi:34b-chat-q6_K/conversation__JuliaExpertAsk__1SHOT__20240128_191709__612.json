We then define concrete types `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck` as subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`. The `ispersonal` function checks if the provided vehicle is either a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`, which are considered personal vehicles for everyday driving. It returns `true` for those two types and `false` for `Bus` and `Truck`. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle` not explicitly mentioned, it will return `false` by default.","status":200,"tokens":[0,266],"elapsed":9.867662935,"_type":"aimessage"}]
