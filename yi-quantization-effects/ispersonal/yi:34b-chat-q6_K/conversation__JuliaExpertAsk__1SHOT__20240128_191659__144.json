The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

We then define concrete types like `Car` and `Motorcycle` which are subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`. The function `ispersonal` takes a vehicle type (`Type{T}` where `T <: AbstractVehicle`) and returns a boolean indicating whether it is a personal vehicle for everyday driving.\n\nThe example usage shows that calling `ispersonal(Car)` or `ispersonal(Motorcycle)` will return `true`, while `ispersonal(Bus)` or `ispersonal(Truck)` will return `false`. For any other type of vehicle not explicitly defined in the function, it will default to `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,300],"elapsed":11.137026039,"_type":"aimessage"}]
