Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can define a trait by creating a new type with a corresponding method that returns the trait for specific subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`. Here's how you can implement the `ispersonal` function:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    if typeof(vehicle) <: Car || typeof(vehicle) <: Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif typeof(vehicle) <: Bus || typeof(vehicle) <: Truck\n        return false\n    end\n    return false\nend\n\n# Example usage:\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n```\n\nIn the `ispersonal` function, we first check if the vehicle is a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`, which are considered personal vehicles for everyday driving. If it's not one of those, we then check if it's a `Bus` or a `Truck`, which are not personal vehicles by default. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, the function returns `false` by default.","status":200,"tokens":[0,316],"elapsed":10.285232075,"_type":"aimessage"}]
