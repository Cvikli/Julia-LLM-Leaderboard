All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

It uses multiple dispatch to check if the vehicle is a Car or Motorcycle, which are considered personal vehicles, and returns true in those cases. For Bus and Truck, it returns false. For any other type of vehicle that is not explicitly defined, it throws an error.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nispersonal(Car())  # This should return true\nispersonal(Motorcycle()) # This should return true\nispersonal(Bus())  # This should return false\nispersonal(Truck()) # This should return false\nispersonal(AbstractVehicle()) # This will throw an error since AbstractVehicle is not a concrete type\n```","status":200,"tokens":[217,254],"elapsed":23.444544916,"_type":"aimessage"}]
