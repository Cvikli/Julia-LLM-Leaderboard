All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can define a trait `ispersonal` using a Union type and overloading the `==` operator to check if a vehicle is one of the personal types.

The `ispersonal` function checks if the vehicle is a member of the `PersonalVehicle` union type using the overloaded `==` operator. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle` that is not explicitly defined in the `==` operator, the default return value of `false` will be used.","status":200,"tokens":[0,385],"elapsed":10.642719837,"_type":"aimessage"}]
