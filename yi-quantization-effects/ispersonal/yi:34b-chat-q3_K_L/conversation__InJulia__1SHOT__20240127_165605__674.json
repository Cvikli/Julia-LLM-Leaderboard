Here's how you could implement this:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\n# Define a trait for personal vehicles\ntrait PersonalVehicle = Union{Car, Motorcycle}\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    return (isa(vehicle, Car) || isa(vehicle, Motorcycle)) # Return true for Cars and Motorcycles\nend\n\n# Example usage:\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n```\n\nIn this example, we've created a `PersonalVehicle` trait using the `Union` type to combine `Car` and `Motorcycle` as they are considered personal vehicles. The `ispersonal` function checks if the provided vehicle is of type `Car` or `Motorcycle` and returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[104,312],"elapsed":8.754474882,"_type":"aimessage"}]
