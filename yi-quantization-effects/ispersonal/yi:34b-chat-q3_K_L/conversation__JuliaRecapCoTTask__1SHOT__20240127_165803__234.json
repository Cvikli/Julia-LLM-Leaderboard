[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving.

It uses multiple dispatch to handle different types of vehicles, and it returns `true` for cars and motorcycles since they are typically used for personal transportation, while it returns `false` for buses and trucks, which are generally not used for personal everyday driving. For any other type of vehicle that is a subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, the function defaults to `false`.\n\nThe code is idiomatic Julia and follows the guidelines provided, including using standard libraries and avoiding explicit packages unless specified. The use of abstract types like `AbstractVehicle` is preferred for multiple dispatch without being too restrictive in terms of performance or clarity.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates that when given instances of `Car` and `Motorcycle`, the function returns `true` as expected, while for `Bus` and `Truck`, it returns `false`. No other special instructions were provided, so this solution adheres to the guidelines set forth.","status":200,"tokens":[0,396],"elapsed":11.113905131,"_type":"aimessage"}]
