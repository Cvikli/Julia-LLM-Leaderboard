All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Approach\n\n1. Define a trait `PersonalVehicle` and create corresponding instances for each vehicle type.\n2. Write the `ispersonal` function that checks if the provided Vehicle is of type `PersonalVehicle` or not.\n3. Ensure that the function works as expected for the given types and default to false for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.\n4. Test the function with an example.\n\n# Code\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct PersonalVehicle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(vehicle::PersonalVehicle) = true\nispersonal(vehicle::Car) = true\nispersonal(vehicle::Motorcycle) = true\nispersonal(vehicle::Bus) = false\nispersonal(vehicle::Truck) = false\nispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle) = false\n\n# Example\nispersonal(Car())  # should return true\n```\n\n# Check and Solution Verification\n\n- The function `ispersonal` is defined with a default behavior for any subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.\n- For the provided types, `PersonalVehicle`, `Car`, and `Motorcycle`, it returns `true` as expected.\n- For `Bus` and `Truck`, it returns `false` as expected.\n- The example demonstrates that `ispersonal(Car())` returns `true`, confirming the function's behavior for cars.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe `ispersonal` function has been correctly implemented according to the task specifications.","status":200,"tokens":[0,380],"elapsed":10.814183548,"_type":"aimessage"}]
