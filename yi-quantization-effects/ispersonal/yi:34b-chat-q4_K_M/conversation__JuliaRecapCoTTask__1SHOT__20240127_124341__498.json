[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The `ispersonal` function checks if the provided vehicle is of type `Car` or `Motorcycle`. If not, it returns false by default.\n\nThe `@isdefined` macro is used to ensure that the types are defined in the current scope before checking their instances. This is necessary because the instructions mention \"Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck.\" However, since these types may not be defined at the time of reading this example, the `@isdefined` macro ensures that the code does not error out if one or more of these types are not currently defined in the global scope.\n\nThe output of the example usage would look like this:\n\n```plaintext\nA car is personal? true\nA motorcycle is personal? true\nA bus is personal? false\nA truck is personal? false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,412],"elapsed":11.862200018,"_type":"aimessage"}]
