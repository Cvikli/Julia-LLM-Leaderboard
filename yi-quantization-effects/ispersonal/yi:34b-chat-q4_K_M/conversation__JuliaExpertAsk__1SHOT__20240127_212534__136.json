The `ispersonal` function checks if the provided vehicle is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. It returns `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle` because they are typically used for individual transportation, and `false` for `Bus` and `Truck` because they are not designed for personal use but rather for public transport or freight transportation. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle` that is not explicitly defined in the function, it returns `false` by default.","status":200,"tokens":[0,309],"elapsed":8.746670965,"_type":"aimessage"}]
