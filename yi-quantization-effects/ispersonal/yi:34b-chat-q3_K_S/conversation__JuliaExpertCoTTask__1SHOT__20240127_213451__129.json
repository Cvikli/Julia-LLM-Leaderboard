All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

It then checks if it's a `Bus` or a `Truck`, which are not personal vehicles but rather transportation vehicles used for larger groups of people or goods transport.
