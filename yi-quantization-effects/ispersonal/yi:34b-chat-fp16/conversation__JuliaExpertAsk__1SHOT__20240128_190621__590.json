We then define concrete types such as `Car` and `Motorcycle` which are personal vehicles, and `Bus` and `Truck` which are not personal vehicles.\n\nThe `ispersonal` function takes a vehicle type (`Type{T}`) as an argument and uses a conditional statement to check if the provided type is `Car` or `Motorcycle`. If it is, the function returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`. The function is generic over any subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, which means we can use it with any new types that we create as long as they are subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,310],"elapsed":24.036089069,"_type":"aimessage"}]
