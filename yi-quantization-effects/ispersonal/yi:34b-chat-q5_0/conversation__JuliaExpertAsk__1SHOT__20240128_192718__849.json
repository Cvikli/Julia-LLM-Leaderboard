The `ispersonal` function checks if the provided vehicle is either a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`, as these are considered personal vehicles for everyday driving. The `Bus` and `Truck` types are not considered personal vehicles, so they return `false`. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, the function defaults to `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[134,264],"elapsed":8.561261264,"_type":"aimessage"}]
