Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

Here's how you can define the function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df::DataFrame)\n    # Filter df to rows where manufacturer is \"audi\" and model is \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\"\n    filtered_df = filter(row -> row.manufacturer == \"audi\" && (row.model == \"a4\" || row.model == \"a4 quattro\"), df)\n    \n    # Add a new column with boolean values\n    filtered_df[!, :audi_a4_type] .= true\n    \n    return filtered_df\nend\n```\n\nNow you can apply this function to your `DataFrame` `df_cars`:\n\n```julia\n# Assuming df_cars is a DataFrame\nresult = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```\n\nThe resulting `DataFrame` `result` will contain only the rows where the manufacturer is \"audi\" and the model is \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\", with an additional column `audi_a4_type` that has a value of `true` for all rows.","status":200,"tokens":[113,299],"elapsed":9.901958239,"_type":"aimessage"}]
