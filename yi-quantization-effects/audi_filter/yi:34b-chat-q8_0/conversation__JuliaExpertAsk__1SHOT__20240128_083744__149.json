Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

Then, it creates a new column called `audi_a4_type` and sets it to `true` for all the remaining rows. Finally, it returns the filtered and modified DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,210],"elapsed":9.4279762,"_type":"aimessage"}]
