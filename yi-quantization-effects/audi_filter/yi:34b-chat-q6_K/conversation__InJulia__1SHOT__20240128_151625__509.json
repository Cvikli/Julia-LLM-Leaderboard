Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

It first filters the DataFrame to keep only the rows where the manufacturer is \"audi\" and the model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". Then it creates a new column `audi_a4_type` and sets its value to `true` for all rows in the filtered DataFrame.\n\nYou can use this function by passing your `df_cars` DataFrame to it:\n\n```julia\n# Assuming df_cars is already defined\nresult = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```\n\nThe result will be a new DataFrame that contains only the rows where manufacturer is \"audi\" and model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\", with an additional column `audi_a4_type` set to `true` for all those rows.","status":200,"tokens":[0,372],"elapsed":13.81507757,"_type":"aimessage"}]
