[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a DataFrame `df_cars` with car data with columns `manufacturer` and `model`. Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

If your dataset has additional columns or specific formatting requirements (e.g., if \"A4 Quattro\" needs to be treated as a separate model), you may need to adjust the filter condition accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,366],"elapsed":9.400248074,"_type":"aimessage"}]
