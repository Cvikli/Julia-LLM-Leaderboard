Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

Filters the `df_cars` DataFrame using the `filter` function to include only rows where the `manufacturer` is \"audi\" and the `model` is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\".\n2. Creates a new column called `audi_a4_type` that is filled with `true` for all rows in the filtered DataFrame.\n3. Returns the resulting DataFrame, which contains only the Audi A4 and A4 Quattro models.\n\nPlease note that you need to have a `df_cars` DataFrame available in your environment to use this function. If `df_cars` is not already defined, you would need to define it before using the `audi_filter` function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,372],"elapsed":10.749529,"_type":"aimessage"}]
