Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    # Filter data to only Audi A4 and A4 Quattro models\n    df_audis = filter(row -> (row.manufacturer == \"audi\") && ((row.model == \"a4\") || (row.model == \"a4 quattro\")), df_cars)\n    # Create a new column with true for all rows\n    df_audis[:audi_a4_type] .= true\n    return df_audis\nend\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. It filters the `df_cars` DataFrame to only include rows where the manufacturer is \"audi\" and the model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\" using the `filter()` function with a predicate function that checks both conditions.\n\n2. It then creates a new column called `audi_a4_type` and initializes it with `true` for all rows in the filtered DataFrame using broadcasting (`.=`) to assign the value to the entire column.\n\n3. Finally, it returns the resulting DataFrame `df_audis` with only Audi A4 and A4 Quattro models and the new `audi_a4_type` column set to `true` for all rows.","status":200,"tokens":[0,291],"elapsed":8.246253807,"_type":"aimessage"}]
