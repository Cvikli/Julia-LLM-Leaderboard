The function `audi_filter` will return a new `DataFrame` with only the rows from the original `DataFrame` that meet the specified criteria, along with an additional column `audi_a4_type` that is filled with `true` for all rows in the filtered dataset.","status":200,"tokens":[0,330],"elapsed":9.530502067,"_type":"aimessage"}]
