The condition checks if the manufacturer is \"audi\" and the model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\".\n\nThen, a new column `audi_a4_type` is created using broadcasting (`.=`) to assign `true` to all rows in the filtered DataFrame.\n\nMake sure to replace `# Your original DataFrame` with your actual `DataFrame` and run the code in a Julia environment to see the results.","status":200,"tokens":[0,363],"elapsed":10.489177343,"_type":"aimessage"}]
