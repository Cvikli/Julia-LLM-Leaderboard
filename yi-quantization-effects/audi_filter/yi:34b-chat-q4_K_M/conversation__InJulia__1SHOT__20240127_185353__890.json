Below is an example of how you might write the `audi_filter` function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    # Filter the dataset to rows with manufacturer \"audi\" and model being \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\"\n    df_audi = filter(row -> row.manufacturer == \"audi\" && (row.model == \"a4\" || row.model == \"a4 quattro\"), df_cars)\n    \n    # Create a new column with `true` across all rows\n    df_audi[!, :audi_a4_type] .= true\n    \n    return df_audi\nend\n\n# Example usage:\n# Assuming there is already a DataFrame called 'df_cars' in the global scope\nfiltered_df = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```\n\nIn this function, we first filter the `df_cars` DataFrame using the `filter` function. The row filter is a function that checks if the manufacturer is \"audi\" and the model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". If the conditions are met, the row is included in the filtered dataset.\n\nNext, we create a new column named `audi_a4_type` with the value `true` for all rows in the filtered DataFrame using broadcasting (`.=`) to assign the same value to all elements of the new column.\n\nFinally, we return the resulting filtered and modified DataFrame.\n\nMake sure to import the `DataFrames` package at the beginning if it hasn't been imported already, and that there is a DataFrame called `df_cars` available in the global scope for the function to work with.","status":200,"tokens":[0,427],"elapsed":12.124943853,"_type":"aimessage"}]
