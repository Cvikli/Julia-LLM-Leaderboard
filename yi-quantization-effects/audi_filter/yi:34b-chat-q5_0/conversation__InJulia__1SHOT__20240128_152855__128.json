The condition checks if the manufacturer is \"audi\" and the model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\".\n\nThe second part of the function adds a new column to the filtered DataFrame with boolean values, indicating whether the car is an Audi A4 type (which we've defined as \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\"). The `[:audi_a4_type]` syntax appends a new column to the end of the DataFrame and assigns `true` to all rows in that column.\n\nFinally, the function returns the resulting filtered and modified DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,404],"elapsed":12.842560413,"_type":"aimessage"}]
