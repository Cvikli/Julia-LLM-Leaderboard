It then filters this subset further to include only rows where the model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". Finally, it iterates over each row of the resulting DataFrame and sets a new column `audi_a4_type` to `true` for all rows.","status":200,"tokens":[0,250],"elapsed":6.62333618,"_type":"aimessage"}]
