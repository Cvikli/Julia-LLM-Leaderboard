You need to import the `DataFrames` package first before using this function.\n\nTo use the function with your dataset `df_cars`, you would write:\n\n```julia\n# Assuming df_cars is a DataFrame in your workspace\nresulting_df = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```\n\nThis will create and return the filtered DataFrame with the new column.","status":200,"tokens":[0,350],"elapsed":9.313017048,"_type":"aimessage"}]
