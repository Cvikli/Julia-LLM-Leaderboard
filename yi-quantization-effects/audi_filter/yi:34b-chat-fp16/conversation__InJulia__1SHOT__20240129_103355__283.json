It then creates a new column called `audi_a4_type` and assigns `true` to all its values. Finally, it returns the filtered and modified DataFrame.\n\nTo use this function with your `df_cars` DataFrame, you would call it like so:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n# Assuming df_cars is a DataFrame\nresult = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```\n\nThis will return a new DataFrame containing only the rows from `df_cars` where the manufacturer is \"audi\" and the model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\", with an additional column `audi_a4_type` that has `true` for all rows.","status":200,"tokens":[0,374],"elapsed":29.018876003,"_type":"aimessage"}]
