Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    # Filter df_cars to only rows with manufacturer \"audi\" and model being \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\"\n    df_audi = filter(row -> row.manufacturer == \"audi\" && (row.model == \"a4\" || row.model == \"a4 quattro\"), df_cars)\n    # Create a new column `audi_a4_type` with value `true` for all rows\n    df_audi[:audi_a4_type] .= true\n    return df_audi\nend\n```\n\nThis function filters the given DataFrame `df_cars` using the `filter` function, which applies a predicate to each row and keeps only those rows where the predicate is `true`. The predicate checks if the manufacturer is \"audi\" and the model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\".\n\nAfter filtering, it creates a new column `audi_a4_type` with a boolean value of `true` for all rows in the filtered DataFrame. Finally, it returns the resulting DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,257],"elapsed":19.92196605,"_type":"aimessage"}]
