It searches for the start and end of a Julia code block using `findfirst` and then iterates over the lines to join all the code lines inside the code block, excluding the line containing the opening and closing fence characters (`-`). Finally, it joins the resulting code blocks with a newline character.","status":200,"tokens":[0,333],"elapsed":14.955176523,"_type":"aimessage"}]
