Here's how you might implement the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Parse the markdown document\n    doc = Markdown.parse(md)\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to hold the extracted Julia code\n    jl_code = \"\"\n\n    # Traverse the AST and find all code blocks with language 'julia'\n    for node in doc\n        if isa(node, Markdown.Code) && node.language == \"julia\"\n            # Remove the three backticks from the start and end of the code block\n            jl_code *= replace(string(node.text), r\"^```julia\\n|\\n```$\" => \"\") * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Remove any leading or trailing newlines\n    jl_code = strip(jl_code)\n\n    return jl_code\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nmd_doc = read(\"example.md\", String) # Replace with your markdown document\njulia_code = extract_julia_code(md_doc)\nprintln(julia_code)\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `\"example.md\"` with the path to your actual markdown file containing Julia code blocks. The function will return a string with all the extracted Julia code from the document, with each code block separated by a newline character.","status":200,"tokens":[0,384],"elapsed":17.24378331,"_type":"aimessage"}]
