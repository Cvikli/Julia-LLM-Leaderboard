Here's how you could define the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regular expression to match a code block with language \"julia\"\n    regex = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"m\n    # Extract all matches from the markdown document\n    matches = eachmatch(regex, md)\n    # Initialize an empty string to accumulate the extracted code\n    code_string = \"\"\n    # Iterate over each match and append the content to `code_string`\n    for match in matches\n        # Get the captured group, which is the code between the fences\n        code = match.captures[1]\n        # Append the code to the string, replacing leading and trailing whitespace with nothing\n        code_string *= \"\\n\" * replace(replace(code, r\"^\\s+\", \"\"), r\"\\s+$\" => \"\")\n    end\n    return code_string\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression to match code blocks with the `julia` language identifier. It then iterates over all matches and captures the code inside the fences, stripping leading and trailing whitespace. Finally, it joins all the code strings together with a newline character.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes there are no nested code blocks and that every code block starts and ends with a blank line to ensure correct matching. If your markdown document does not adhere to these assumptions, you might need a more sophisticated approach.","status":200,"tokens":[0,376],"elapsed":16.892668007,"_type":"aimessage"}]
