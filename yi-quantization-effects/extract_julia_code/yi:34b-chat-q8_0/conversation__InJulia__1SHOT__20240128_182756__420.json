Below is an example of how you might implement such a function using Regular Expressions (regex) in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # The following regex matches lines that start with '```julia' and end with '```', including leading whitespace\n    code_block = r\"^\\s*```julia[\\w\\W]*?```\"m\n\n    # Match all code blocks in the Markdown document\n    matches = eachmatch(code_block, md)\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to hold the extracted code\n    extracted_code = \"\"\n\n    # Iterate over each match and append the content to `extracted_code`\n    for m in matches\n        # Extract the code block text between the opening and closing fence\n        code_block_text = m.match[6:(end-3)]\n        # Remove leading whitespace from each line in the code block\n        lines = map(line -> strip(line), split(code_block_text, \"\\n\"))\n        # Join the lines with a newline\n        joined_code = join(lines, \"\\n\")\n        # Append the joined code to `extracted_code`\n        extracted_code *= joined_code * \"\\n\"\n    end\n\n    return extracted_code\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nmd = \"\"\"\n# This is a markdown document\n\n```julia\nfunction add(a, b)\n    return a + b\nend\n```\n\nMore text...\n\n```julia\nadd(1, 2)  # Output should be 3\n```\n\"\"\"\n\n# Call the function with the provided Markdown document\nextracted_code = extract_julia_code(md)\n\nprintln(extracted_code)\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `extract_julia_code` that takes in a string `md` representing the Markdown document and returns a string containing all the Julia code blocks extracted from it. The function uses a regex to find code blocks delimited by ````julia` and then removes the fences, strips leading whitespace from each line, joins the lines with newlines, and concatenates all the code blocks together.\n\nPlease note that this example assumes there are no nested code blocks and that every code block is a valid piece of Julia code (i.e., it can be parsed by the Julia parser). It also assumes that there are no errors in the Markdown document, such as unclosed fences or malformed syntax within the code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[0,605],"elapsed":27.281137986,"_type":"aimessage"}]
