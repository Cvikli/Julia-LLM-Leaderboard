Here's how you could implement the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Parse the Markdown document into an AbstractString\n    doc = Markdown.parse(md)\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to hold the extracted code\n    extracted_code = \"\"\n\n    # Iterate over the children of the document\n    for child in doc\n        # If a child is a CodeBlock, process it\n        if child isa Markdown.CodeBlock\n            # Get the language of the code block (\"julia\" or \" Julia\")\n            language = String(child.info)\n            # Only consider code blocks with language \"julia\"\n            if language == \"julia\" || language == \" Julia\"\n                # Remove the leading and trailing fences from the content\n                code_text = child.content[2:end - 2]\n                # Append the code to the extracted code string\n                extracted_code *= \"\\n\" * code_text\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return stripped_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function assumes that there are no nested code blocks and that all code fences in the document start with `~~~` or `````. If you have a more complex Markdown structure, you might need to handle it differently. For example, if the code blocks are within lists or tables, you would need to account for the surrounding whitespace and structure when joining the code blocks together.\n\nPlease note that this function does not perform any error checking or handling of malformed input. It is also possible that the `Markdown.parse` function may change in future versions of Julia, so it's important to check the documentation for the latest usage.","status":200,"tokens":[85,443],"elapsed":20.072138451,"_type":"aimessage"}]
