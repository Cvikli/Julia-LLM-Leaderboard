Here's how you can define the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Parse the Markdown document into an AST\n    ast = Markdown.parse(md)\n\n    # Initialize a variable to hold the extracted code\n    extracted_code = \"\"\n\n    # Traverse the AST and look for code blocks with language 'julia'\n    for node in ast\n        if isa(node, Markdown.CodeBlock) && node.lang == \"julia\"\n            # Append the code inside the block to the extracted code\n            extracted_code *= strip(String(node.content))\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks with newlines\n    return stripped_code = replace(extracted_code, r\"^```julia\\n|\\n```$\" => \"\") * \"\\n\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. Parses the Markdown document `md` into an abstract syntax tree (AST) using `Markdown.parse`.\n2. Iterates over the nodes of the AST, looking for code blocks with language `julia`.\n3. If a code block is found, it strips any leading and trailing whitespace and appends the content to `extracted_code`.\n4. After all the code blocks have been processed, it removes the code fences (`^```julia\\n` and `\\n```$`) from the extracted code using `replace`.\n5. Finally, it joins the extracted code together with newlines and returns the result as a string.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes there are no nested code blocks and that all code blocks are written in Julia. It also does not handle cases where the Markdown document contains non-Julia code blocks or other types of content, such as headers, lists, or links. If your Markdown documents are more complex, you may need to adjust this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,495],"elapsed":14.398381588,"_type":"aimessage"}]
