It then iterates over each line of the markdown document and checks if it matches the pattern. If so, it adds the content inside the code fence (everything between the markers) to an empty string, along with a newline character. Finally, it returns the combined code string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,302],"elapsed":8.713079296,"_type":"aimessage"}]
