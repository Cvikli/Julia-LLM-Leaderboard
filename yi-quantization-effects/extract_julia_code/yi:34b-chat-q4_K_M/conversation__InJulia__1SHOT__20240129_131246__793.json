It then iterates over each match, strips any leading and trailing whitespace from the content of the code block, and joins all the code blocks together with a newline. Finally, it returns the combined string of extracted Julia code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,272],"elapsed":7.848390634,"_type":"aimessage"}]
