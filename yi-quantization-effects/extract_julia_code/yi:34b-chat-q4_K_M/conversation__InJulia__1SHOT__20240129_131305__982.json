It uses a regular expression to match code blocks with a specific language identifier (in this case, \"julia\"). The matches are replaced with empty strings to remove the code fences. Then, the text is split into lines and any empty lines are filtered out. Finally, the remaining non-empty lines are joined back together with a newline character.","status":200,"tokens":[0,269],"elapsed":7.749632092,"_type":"aimessage"}]
