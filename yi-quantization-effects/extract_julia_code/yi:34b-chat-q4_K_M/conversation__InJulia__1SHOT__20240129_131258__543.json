Here's an example of how you might write the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code fences with language \"julia\"\n    julia_code = match.(r\"^```julia\\n((?:\\s|[^\\n])*?)\\n```\", md).captures\n\n    # If there's no match, return an empty string\n    if julia_code === nothing || julia_code == []\n        return \"\"\n    end\n\n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = join(julia_code)\n\n    # Remove leading and trailing whitespace\n    trimmed_code = replace(joined_code, r\"^\\s+|\\s+$\" => \"\")\n\n    return trimmed_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression to find all occurrences of ````julia` followed by any number of lines (indicated by the `*?`) and then `````. The matches are captured using the `captures` method, which returns an Array of Strings containing each code block. If there's no match, it returns an empty string.\n\nThe function then joins these captures together into a single string and trims any leading or trailing whitespace to ensure that the returned code is clean and ready for use.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no nested code blocks within the Julia code blocks, which might require additional processing if such cases need to be handled.","status":200,"tokens":[0,385],"elapsed":11.123656884,"_type":"aimessage"}]
