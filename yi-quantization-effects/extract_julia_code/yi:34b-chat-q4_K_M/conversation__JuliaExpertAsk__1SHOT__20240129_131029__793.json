Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regular expression to match Julia code blocks\n    regex = r\"```julia\\n((?:\\s|[^\\n])*?)\\n```\"\n\n    # Match all occurrences of the regex in the markdown document\n    matches = eachmatch(regex, md)\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the extracted code\n    code_str = \"\"\n\n    # Iterate over matches and append the content inside the code blocks\n    for match in matches\n        # Get the group 1 of the match, which contains the actual code\n        code_block = match.captures[1]\n        # Remove leading and trailing whitespace from the code block\n        clean_code_block = replace(code_block, r\"^\\s+|\\s+$\" => \"\")\n        # Append the clean code block to the final string\n        code_str *= \"\\n\" * clean_code_block\n    end\n\n    return code_str\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression to match ````julia` code blocks in the markdown document. It then iterates over all matches and captures the content inside the code block. The leading and trailing whitespace is removed from each code block before appending it to the final string. The newline at the end of each code block is preserved by using `*= \"\\n\"`, which concatenates a newline character to the existing string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,331],"elapsed":9.558265506,"_type":"aimessage"}]
