Defines a regular expression pattern to match `julia` code blocks with the leading and trailing triple backticks (`````).\n2. Uses a capturing group within the regex to capture the content inside the code fences, which includes the opening and closing backticks.\n3. Applies the regex to the Markdown document string `md` and stores all the captures in an array called `captures`.\n4. Joins the captured code blocks together with newlines using `join()`.\n5. Removes any leading and trailing whitespace from the joined code using `strip()`.\n6. Finally, it returns the extracted Julia code as a string.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the Markdown document only contains `julia` code blocks and does not handle other types of code fences or mixed content within the same line. It also assumes that there are no newlines within the code fence itself, which would require more complex parsing.","status":200,"tokens":[85,383],"elapsed":11.001865251,"_type":"aimessage"}]
