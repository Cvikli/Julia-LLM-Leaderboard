It then replaces each match with the content inside the code block without the surrounding triple backticks. After that, it strips leading and trailing whitespace from each line in the content and finally joins them together with newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,222],"elapsed":6.411316677,"_type":"aimessage"}]
