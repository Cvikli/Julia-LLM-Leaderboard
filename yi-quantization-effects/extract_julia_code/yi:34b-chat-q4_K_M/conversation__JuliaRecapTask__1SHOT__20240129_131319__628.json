[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

It captures the entire code block and then the content inside it. The first capturing group is discarded because it includes the opening and closing code fences, which we don't need. The second capturing group contains only the code within the code blocks.\n\nThe matched code blocks are joined together with a newline character to create a single string of all the extracted code. Then, leading and trailing whitespace from each line is removed using another regular expression.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes there are no nested code blocks and that the markdown document contains only `julia` code blocks. If there are other types of code blocks or if the markdown uses different syntax for code highlighting, the regular expression would need to be adjusted accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[396,466],"elapsed":13.97606931,"_type":"aimessage"}]
