It then checks if the language of each code block is `julia` and extracts the content between the fences, removing the fences themselves. Finally, it joins all the lines of the code blocks together with a newline.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes there are no nested code blocks and that the code blocks do not contain any other markdown syntax (like headers or lists) that could interfere with the extraction process. If your markdown document contains such elements, you would need to modify the regex and the logic of the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[85,465],"elapsed":13.686279291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
