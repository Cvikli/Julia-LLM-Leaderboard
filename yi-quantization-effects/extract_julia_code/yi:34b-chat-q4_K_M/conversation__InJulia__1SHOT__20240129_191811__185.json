Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String.

Here's how you can implement the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Parse the Markdown document\n    doc = Markdown.parse(md)\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the extracted code\n    extracted_code = \"\"\n\n    # Traverse the dictionary and look for code blocks with language 'julia'\n    for i in eachindex(values(doc))\n        block = doc[i]\n        if isa(block, Markdown.Code) && block.lang == \"julia\"\n            # Remove the code fences (```) from the beginning and end of the code block\n            code_text = replace(string(block.content), r\"^`{3}\\s*|\\s*`{3}$\" => \"\")\n            # Append the code to the extracted string with a newline if there's already some text\n            extracted_code *= code_text * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return extracted_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes in a `String` representing the Markdown document and returns another `String` containing the concatenated Julia code blocks without the leading and trailing code fences. The function uses regular expressions to remove the code fences, and it appends each code block with a newline character to ensure that the output is readable.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no nested code blocks and that all code blocks are written in Julia language. If you have any other requirements or need to handle more complex Markdown structures, you might need to adjust the logic accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,416],"elapsed":12.091202832,"_type":"aimessage"}]
