It then captures the content inside each code block and removes leading and trailing whitespace using `replace()` with a regex that matches one or more newlines (`\"\\n+\"`) and replaces it with a single newline character. Finally, it concatenates all the clean content together with a newline between each piece of code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,301],"elapsed":8.685343054,"_type":"aimessage"}]
