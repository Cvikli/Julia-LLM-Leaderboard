It then iterates over all matches and removes the leading and trailing whitespace from the content before joining them together with a newline. Finally, it returns the combined code as a single string without any newlines between the original code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[0,300],"elapsed":8.660122629,"_type":"aimessage"}]
