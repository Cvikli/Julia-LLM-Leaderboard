It does this by iterating over each line in the markdown document and looking for lines that start with ````julia` and end with ````` using a regular expression. If a match is found, the content between the code fences is captured and appended to the output string. Finally, any newlines within the code blocks are preserved by joining the code blocks with a newline character.","status":200,"tokens":[0,310],"elapsed":8.985021445,"_type":"aimessage"}]
