Here's an example of how you might implement such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regular expression for matching Julia code blocks\n    # This regex looks for three backticks followed by \"julia\", and then captures the code block content\n    pattern = r\"```julia([^`]*)```\"m\n\n    # Use a regular expression match to find all occurrences of the pattern\n    matches = eachmatch(pattern, md)\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the extracted code blocks\n    code_blocks = \"\"\n\n    # Iterate over the matches and append the content of each code block to the result\n    for m in matches\n        # Get the captured group from the match\n        content = m.captures[1]\n\n        # Remove the leading and trailing whitespace from the content\n        cleaned_content = replace(content, r\"^\\s+|\\s+$\" => \"\")\n\n        # Append the code block to the result with a newline if there's more than one code block\n        if code_blocks != \"\"\n            code_blocks *= \"\\n\"\n        end\n        code_blocks *= cleaned_content\n    end\n\n    return code_blocks\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression to match ````julia` code blocks. It then iterates over all matches and captures the content inside the code block. The leading and trailing whitespace are removed from each code block, and the blocks are joined together with a newline character.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes there are no nested code blocks and that the Markdown document is well-formed. It also does not handle errors or cases where the code fence does not contain \"julia\" (which would be necessary if you want to extract other types of code blocks).","status":200,"tokens":[85,448],"elapsed":13.123587902,"_type":"aimessage"}]
