It captures the content between the code fences and then removes leading and trailing whitespace from each line using `replace` with a regex to match one or more whitespace characters (`r\"\\s+\"`). Finally, it joins all lines with a newline using `join`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,245],"elapsed":7.056322811,"_type":"aimessage"}]
