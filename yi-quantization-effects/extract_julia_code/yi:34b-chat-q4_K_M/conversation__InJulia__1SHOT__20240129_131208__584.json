It then replaces these matches with the content inside the code block, stripped of the surrounding backticks and newlines. The `join` function is used to concatenate the lines within each code block with a newline character. Finally, the leading and trailing whitespace is removed from the result using `strip`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,220],"elapsed":6.334810775,"_type":"aimessage"}]
