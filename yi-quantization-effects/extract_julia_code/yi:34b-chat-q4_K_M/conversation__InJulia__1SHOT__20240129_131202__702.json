[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To extract Julia code blocks from a Markdown document in Julia, you can use regular expressions to match the code fence patterns and then join the code blocks together. Here's an example of how you might write the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # The following regex matches a code block with or without a language identifier,\n    # followed by zero or more occurrences of a newline character.\n    # Note that the `\\n*` is a single entity and not two separate characters.\n    # This allows us to match multiple consecutive blank lines as one group.\n    code_block = r\"```julia([^\\n]*\\n)*```\"m\n\n    # Use a capture group to keep only the content inside the code fence\n    # (everything between the opening and closing ```).\n    # The `\\g<0>` refers to the entire match, which we then split on newlines.\n    code_blocks = split(md, code_block, keep=false)[1:end-1]  # Remove first and last matches (empty strings)\n\n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n\n    # Remove leading and trailing whitespace from the joined code\n    return replace(joined_code, r\"^\\s+|\\s+$\" => \"\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works as follows:\n\n1. It uses a regular expression to match ````julia` code fences with zero or more newlines after them.\n2. The matches are split on the code fence regex, which results in an array of strings containing both the code blocks and any non-code block text.\n3. The first and last elements of the array are removed because they correspond to the empty strings before and after the first and last code fences, respectively.\n4. The remaining strings (the actual code blocks) are joined together with a newline character.\n5. Leading and trailing whitespace is removed from the resulting string using another regular expression.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no nested code blocks and that all ````julia` fences are properly closed by a matching `````. If you have examples or need to handle more complex scenarios, such as nested code blocks or code blocks with language identifiers other than `julia`, the regex would need to be adjusted accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,538],"elapsed":15.636778376,"_type":"aimessage"}]
