Here's how you could implement the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Parse the markdown document\n    ast = Markdown.parse(md)\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to hold the extracted code blocks\n    result = \"\"\n\n    # Traverse the AST and look for code blocks\n    for node in ast\n        if Markdown.is_code(node) && startsWith(Markdown.content(node)[1], \"julia\")\n            # Remove the code fences\n            code_block = replace(String(node), r\"^```julia\\n|\\n```$\" => \"\")\n            # Join consecutive lines with a newline\n            code_block = join(split(code_block))\n            # Append to the result string\n            result *= code_block * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a `String` representing the markdown document and uses `Markdown.parse` to parse it into an AbstractString tree, which is then iterated over using a for loop. The code blocks that are identified as Julia code (based on the language identifier in the fenced code block) are processed by removing the leading and trailing \"```julia\\n\" sequences, and then joining the lines inside the code block with newline characters. Finally, all the extracted code blocks are concatenated together with newlines between them, and the resulting string is returned.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that each Julia code block is surrounded by a pair of \"```julia\\n\" sequences without any blank lines in between. It also does not handle nested code blocks or code blocks with language identifiers other than \"julia\". If these scenarios are possible in your use case, you would need to modify the function accordingly.\n\nTo test this function, you can provide a markdown document as an argument and it should return the concatenated Julia code blocks without the code fences:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\n# Your markdown document here\nmd = \"\"\"\n# My Document Title\n\nSome text before code block 1\n\n```julia\nfunction add(a, b)\n    return a + b\nend\n```\n\nMore text after code block 1\n\n```julia\nstruct Example\n    value::Int64\nend\n```\n\nEven more text after code block 2\n\"\"\"\n\n# Call the function and print the result\nresult = extract_julia_code(md)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis should output the two extracted Julia code blocks without the ````julia\\n` fences:\n\n```julia\nfunction add(a, b)\n    return a + b\nend\n\nstruct Example\n    value::Int64\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,686],"elapsed":21.94843276,"_type":"aimessage"}]
