[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can use regular expressions to extract Markdown code blocks and then join them together. Here's how you could define the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Use a regular expression to find all Julia code blocks\n    # The regex matches 3 or more ` on either side of a line, followed by any number of lines that are not empty and do not start with `\n    # Example match: ```julia\n    # function f(x)\n    #     return x^2\n    # end\n    # ```\n    julia_code = filter(!isempty, split(md, r\"(?<=^\\s*```julia[ \\t]*)(\\r?\\n)(?=[\\S]|\\A)\"))\n    \n    # Remove the leading and trailing ` from each line\n    return join(map(line -> strip(line, '`'), julia_code), \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. It uses a regular expression to find all instances of ````julia` followed by a newline and any number of lines that are not empty and do not start with a backtick (``). This matches the Julia code blocks in the Markdown document.\n2. The resulting matches are split into an array, which includes both the opening and closing code fence lines as well as the actual code.\n3. To get only the code, we filter out any empty strings (which would be the blank lines between code blocks) using `filter(!isempty, ...)`.\n4. Finally, we join the remaining non-empty lines with a newline character to ensure that the resulting string has proper line breaks.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the Markdown document only contains Julia code blocks and does not handle any other types of code blocks or Markdown elements. If your Markdown document may contain multiple types of code blocks (e.g., ````python`, ````latex`, etc.), you would need to adjust the regular expression accordingly or provide a way to specify which language's code blocks should be extracted.","status":200,"tokens":[0,485],"elapsed":18.052649344,"_type":"aimessage"}]
