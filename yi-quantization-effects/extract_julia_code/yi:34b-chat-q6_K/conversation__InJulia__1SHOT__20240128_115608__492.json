[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String.

Below is an example implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Define a regular expression to match code blocks with julia language\n    # The regex looks for three backticks, followed by \"julia\" or \"julia-repl\",\n    # followed by more than one newline, and then ends with another set of three backticks.\n    julia_code_blocks = r\"```julia(?:-(repl))?\\n((?:\\S+\\n)*)```\"m\n\n    # Match all occurrences of the code blocks in the markdown document\n    matches = matchall(julia_code_blocks, md)\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to accumulate the extracted code\n    extracted_code = \"\"\n\n    # Iterate over each matched code block and add it to the accumulated string\n    for m in matches\n        # Remove the leading and trailing backticks of the code block\n        code = replace(m.captures[1], r\"^```|```$\" => \"\")\n\n        # If there are multiple blocks, join them with a newline\n        if extracted_code != \"\"\n            extracted_code *= \"\\n\"\n        end\n        extracted_code *= code\n    end\n\n    return extracted_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses `matchall` to find all the occurrences of Julia code blocks in the markdown document. It then iterates over these matches, removing the leading and trailing backticks using `replace`, and joining the code blocks with a newline if there are multiple. Finally, it returns the accumulated string of extracted code.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes you have only Julia code blocks in your markdown document. If there are other types of code blocks or nested code blocks, the function might need to be modified accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[85,437],"elapsed":16.406531108,"_type":"aimessage"}]
