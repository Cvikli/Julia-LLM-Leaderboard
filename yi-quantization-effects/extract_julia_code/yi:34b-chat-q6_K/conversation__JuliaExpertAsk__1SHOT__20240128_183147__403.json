It uses a regular expression to match Julia code blocks and then iterates over all matches, extracting the content and removing the code fences. The content of each code block is indented by at least 4 spaces or 1 tab. If there are multiple code blocks, they are joined together with a newline character.","status":200,"tokens":[0,317],"elapsed":11.766983926,"_type":"aimessage"}]
