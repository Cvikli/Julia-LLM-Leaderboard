Here's how you could define a function `extract_julia_code` that does this:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regular expression for code fences with language \"julia\"\n    language_regex = r\"^```julia\"m\n    end_regex = r\"^```\\s*$\"m\n\n    # Split the document into lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\"; keepempty=false)\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to hold the extracted code\n    code = \"\"\n\n    # Loop through each line and check for code fences\n    for (i, line) in enumerate(lines)\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\") && endswith(line, \"```\")\n            # If we find a code fence, add the content to the code string\n            code *= join(lines[i+1:findnext(end_regex, line) - 1], \"\\n\")\n            # Adjust the index to skip over the end of the code block\n            i += findnext(end_regex, line).start - i - 1\n        elseif !isempty(line) && !startswith(line, \"```\")\n            # If the line is not empty and does not start with a code fence, add it to the code string\n            code *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses two regular expressions: one for matching the start of a `julia` code block (`^```julia`) and another for matching the end (`^````). It then iterates over each line in the Markdown document, concatenating the lines that do not match these patterns into a single string.\n\nNote that this function does not handle nested code blocks or errors where the number of opening and closing code fences do not match. It also assumes that there is at least one non-empty line of Julia code in the document.","status":200,"tokens":[85,472],"elapsed":17.708467138,"_type":"aimessage"}]
