Looks for instances of ````julia` followed by zero or more tabs (`[ \\t]*`) and then a newline `\\n` to match the start of the code fence.\n2. Finds all occurrences of this pattern in the markdown document using `matchall()`.\n3. Extracts the content inside the code fences, which are actually substrings that do not include the leading and trailing whitespaces from each line.\n4. Removes leading and trailing whitespace from each line within the content using `strip(line)` for each line.\n5. Joins all lines together with a newline character to form a single code block.\n6. Appends the joined code blocks to an array of strings.\n7. Finally, joins all the code blocks together with a newline character to return a string.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes a specific format for the code fences, which may need to be adjusted if the markdown document uses different syntax or if there are other languages mixed in the same document.","status":200,"tokens":[0,568],"elapsed":14.621255134,"_type":"aimessage"}]
