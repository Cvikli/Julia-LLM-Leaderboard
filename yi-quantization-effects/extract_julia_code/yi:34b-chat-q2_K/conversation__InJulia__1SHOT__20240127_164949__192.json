It then iterates over each line of the markdown document, appending the contents of each code block to a temporary array until it encounters the end of a code fence, at which point it joins all the code blocks together with newlines between them.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no nested code fences or other content within the markdown that could interfere with its operation. If your Markdown document contains non-standard elements such as headers (`#`) or lists, this function may need to be adapted accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[85,467],"elapsed":12.142888852,"_type":"aimessage"}]
