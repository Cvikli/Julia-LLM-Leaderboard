Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To extract Julia code blocks from a Markdown document in Julia, you can use regular expressions to find code blocks and then join them together. Here's an example of how you might write the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regular expression for matching code fences with content type \"julia\"\n    julia_code_blocks = r\"(?<=^(?:-{3,}|`{3,})>[jJ]ulia-lang.org)(.*?)(?=-{3,}|\\\\{3,}++\\|)|\\n\"\n    # Use sub to replace matches with the contents inside the code block (group 1)\n    return String(replace(md, julia_code_blocks, raw\"\\$1\"))\nend\n```\n\nThe regex used in this function looks for:\n- `(-{3,}` or ``{3,}`` to match the start of a code fence with three or more consecutive hyphens or backticks).\n- `(?<=^(?:-{3,}|`{3,})>)[jJ]ulia-lang.org)` to assert that what follows is \"julia-lang.org\" (case insensitive) at the start of a line (after the code fence start).\n- `(.*?)` to match any content inside the code block (non-greedy to allow for multiple code blocks on different lines).\n- `(?=-{3,}|\\\\{3,}++\\|)` or `\\n` to match either the end of a code fence with three or more consecutive hyphens or backticks or a newline character.\n\nThe `replace` function is used to replace all matches of the regex with the contents inside the code block (group 1). The `raw\"$1\"` syntax ensures that Julia interprets the string as raw strings, meaning that the backslashes are not interpreted as escape characters, and thus they are passed through to the regex unchanged.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is no other content in the Markdown document that could potentially match the regex used to find code blocks. If you have other content that could cause issues (like headers or lists), you might need to modify the regex accordingly or preprocess the Markdown document to ensure that it does not interfere with the extraction of the Julia code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[0,529],"elapsed":13.606366896,"_type":"aimessage"}]
