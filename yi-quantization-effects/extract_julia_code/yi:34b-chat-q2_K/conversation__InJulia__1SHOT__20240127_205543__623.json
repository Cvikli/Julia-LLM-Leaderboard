It uses a regular expression to match the ````julia` blocks and then joins the contents of all matched groups with a newline character. Finally, it removes any leading whitespace from the start of each line within the code blocks before returning the concatenated string.","status":200,"tokens":[85,357],"elapsed":9.326182684,"_type":"aimessage"}]
