Here's how you can define the `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regular expression to find code blocks with language \"julia\"\n    re = Regex(\"\\n```julia\\n([^\\n]*\\S)\\n?```\")\n\n    # Match all instances of the pattern in the markdown document\n    matches = matchall(re, md)\n\n    # If no matches found, return an empty string\n    if length(matches) == 0\n        return \"\"\n    end\n\n    # Extract each code block and remove the fences (```julia\\n and \\n```)\n    code_blocks = join([String(m[1]) for m in matches], \"\\n\")\n\n    # Remove leading whitespace from first line if it exists\n    if occursin(' ', code_blocks[1])\n        code_blocks = replace(code_blocks, first(code_blocks)[1:end - 1] => \"\")\n    else\n        code_blocks = strip(code_blocks) # Remove leading and trailing whitespace if no leading whitespace exists in the first line\n    end\n\n    # Return the joined code blocks with newlines between them\n    return code_blocks\nend\n```\n\nNow, you can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# This is a markdown document\n\n## With Julia code blocks\n\n```julia\nfunction example()\n    println(\"This is an example function.\")\nend\n```\n\nMore text followed by another Julia code block:\n\n```julia\nconst CONSTANT = 42\n```\n\nAnd some more text without a code block.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Call the extract_julia_code function\nresult = extract_julia_code(md)\nprintln(result) # Output: \"function example() \\n    println(\\\"This is an example function.\\\") \\nend\\nconst CONSTANT = 42\\n\"\n```\n\nThis will print the following to your console:\n\n```plaintext\nfunction example()\n    println(\"This is an example function.\")\nend\nconst CONSTANT = 42\n```\n\nThe whitespace at the beginning of the first code block is removed, and the output is joined with newlines between each code block.","status":200,"tokens":[0,551],"elapsed":14.171822975,"_type":"aimessage"}]
