[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String.

Here's how you could implement the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Parse the markdown document\n    doc = Markdown.parse(md)\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to hold the extracted code\n    extracted_code = \"\"\n\n    # Traverse the tree and look for code blocks\n    for node in doc\n        if isa(node, Markdown.Code) && node.lang == \"julia\"\n            # Remove the code fences (```) from the beginning and end of the code block\n            code_text = replace(string(node.content), r\"^```\\s*julia\\s*$|```\" => \"\")\n            # Join all lines of the code block with a newline\n            extracted_code *= \"\\n\" * code_text\n        end\n    end\n\n    return extracted_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. Parses the Markdown document into an AbstractString tree using `Markdown.parse`.\n2. Iterates over each node in the tree.\n3. Checks if the node is a code block (`Markdown.Code`) and if it has the language specified as \"julia\".\n4. Removes the opening and closing code fences for Julia code blocks using `replace` with a regular expression.\n5. Joins all lines of the code block with a newline character.\n6. Appends the extracted code to an empty string that will hold the final result.\n7. Returns the final string containing all the joined Julia code blocks.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes there are no nested code blocks and that every code block is preceded and followed by text or other non-code block elements. If you have complex Markdown with nested code blocks, you might need a more sophisticated algorithm to handle such cases correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,471],"elapsed":36.631747082,"_type":"aimessage"}]
