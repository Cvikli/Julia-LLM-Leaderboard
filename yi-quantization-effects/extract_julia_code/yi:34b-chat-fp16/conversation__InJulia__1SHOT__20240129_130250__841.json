Below is an example of how you might write a function to do this:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Initialize an empty string to hold the extracted code\n    extracted_code = \"\"\n\n    # Parse the markdown document into an AbstractSyntaxTree (AST)\n    ast = parse(Markdown.MD, md)\n\n    # Iterate over all the elements in the AST\n    for i in ast\n        # If an element is a code block, and its language is Julia\n        if isa(i, Markdown.CodeBlock) && i.language == \"julia\"\n            # Append the code to the extracted string, removing the fences\n            extracted_code *= strip(String(i.text), '`') * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return the extracted code as a string\n    return extracted_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Markdown` package to parse the Markdown document into an AbstractSyntaxTree (AST). It then iterates over all elements in the AST, looking for `CodeBlock` elements with a language of \"julia\". For each such code block, it strips the backticks from the text and appends the result to an empty string, separating each code block with a newline character. Finally, it returns the combined string as the extracted Julia code.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no nested code blocks and that all code blocks are of the same language (Julia). If these assumptions do not hold, more sophisticated parsing would be required to handle such cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,388],"elapsed":30.094033667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
