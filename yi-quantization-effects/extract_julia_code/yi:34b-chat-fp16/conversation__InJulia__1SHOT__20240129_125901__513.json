[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To extract Julia code blocks from a Markdown document in Julia, you can use the `Markdown` package. Here's how you can define the function `extract_julia_code`:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Create an IOBuffer to hold the extracted code\n    buf = IOBuffer()\n\n    # Parse the markdown document\n    for (i, block) in enumerate(Markdown.parse(md))\n        # If the block is a code fence and its language is Julia\n        if Markdown.is_code(block) && occursin(\"julia\", Markdown.language(block))\n            # Write the content of the code fence to the buffer without the fences\n            write(buf, Markdown.content(block))\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Convert the IOBuffer to a string and return it\n    String(take!(buf))\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a `String` representing the Markdown document and returns another `String` with all the Julia code blocks concatenated. It does this by iterating over each block in the parsed Markdown document and checking if the block is a code fence with the language set to \"julia\". If so, it writes the content of the code fence (without the fences) to an `IOBuffer`. After processing all the blocks, it converts the buffer to a string and returns it.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no nested code blocks and that all code blocks are properly formatted with three backticks on each line. It also assumes that there is only one language specified in the code fences (which is \"julia\" in this case). If these assumptions do not hold, more sophisticated parsing might be required.","status":200,"tokens":[85,390],"elapsed":30.267984413,"_type":"aimessage"}]
