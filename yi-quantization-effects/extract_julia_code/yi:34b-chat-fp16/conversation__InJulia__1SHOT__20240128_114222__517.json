Here's how you can write a function `extract_julia_code` that does this:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Parse the Markdown document into an AbstractString\n    doc = Markdown.parse(md)\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the extracted code blocks\n    extracted_code = \"\"\n\n    # Loop through each child of the document\n    for child in doc.children\n        # If a child is a code block, extract its contents and append to the result\n        if Markdown.iscode(child) && Markdown.mimetype(child) == \"text/x-julia\"\n            extracted_code *= Markdown.text(child)\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Remove leading and trailing whitespace from the extracted code\n    return replace(extracted_code, r\"^\\s+|\\s+$\" => \"\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. Parses the Markdown document using `Markdown.parse`.\n2. Iterates over each child of the parsed document.\n3. Checks if a child is a code block with Julia language (using `Markdown.iscode` and `Markdown.mimetype`).\n4. If it's a Julia code block, it extracts the text using `Markdown.text` and appends it to the result string.\n5. Finally, removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the extracted code using regular expression substitution.\n\nNote that this function assumes that there is only one code block with Julia language in the document. If there can be multiple code blocks, you would need to modify the function to handle concatenating the code blocks correctly.\n\nTo use this function, simply call it with your Markdown document as an argument:\n\n```julia\nmd_doc = \"\"\"\n# My Document\n\n```julia\nfunction myfunc()\n    println(\"Hello, World!\")\nend\n```\n\nMore content...\n\"\"\"\n\nextracted_code = extract_julia_code(md_doc)\nprintln(extracted_code)\n```\n\nThis will print out the Julia code block from the Markdown document:\n\n```julia\nfunction myfunc()\n    println(\"Hello, World!\")\nend\n```\n\nRemember to install the `Markdown` package if you haven't already by running `using Pkg; Pkg.add(\"Markdown\")` in your Julia session.","status":200,"tokens":[85,615],"elapsed":47.840551036,"_type":"aimessage"}]
