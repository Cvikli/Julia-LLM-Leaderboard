Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regular expression to match Julia code blocks\n    pattern = r\"^```julia\\n([\\s\\S]+?)\\n```\"m\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the extracted code\n    result = \"\"\n\n    # Iterate over all matches in the markdown document\n    for match in eachmatch(pattern, md)\n        # Get the content of the code block without the fences\n        content = strip(match.captures[1])\n\n        # Append the content to the result with a newline if there are multiple code blocks\n        if result != \"\"\n            result *= \"\\n\"\n        end\n\n        # Append the content of the current match\n        result *= content\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression to match `julia` code blocks with triple backticks (`````). It captures the content inside the code block and strips any leading or trailing whitespace. Then it iterates over all matches, appending each one to an empty string after ensuring there's a newline between them if there are multiple code blocks present in the markdown document. Finally, it returns the combined code as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[115,286],"elapsed":22.195989003,"_type":"aimessage"}]
