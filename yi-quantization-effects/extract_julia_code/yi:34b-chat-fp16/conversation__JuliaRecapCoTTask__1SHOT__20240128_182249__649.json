[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\"; keepempty=false)\n    code_blocks = filter(line -> startswith(line, \"```julia\"), lines)\n    if length(code_blocks) > 0\n        end_index = findfirst(x -> x == \"```\", lines[findlast(x -> x == \"```julia\", lines):end]).row - 1\n        return join([strip(line) for line in code_blocks], \"\\n\")[8:end-3] * \"\\n\"\n    else\n        return \"\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. Splits the markdown document into lines.\n2. Filters out only the lines that start with ````julia` (assuming that's how Julia code blocks are denoted in the markdown).\n3. Finds the index of the first occurrence of ````` after the last occurrence of ````julia` to determine the ending index for extracting the code block content.\n4. Strips leading whitespace from each line and joins them together with newlines.\n5. Finally, it removes the opening and closing code fence markers (````` on both sides) and returns the extracted code as a string.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the markdown document is well-formed, meaning that for every ````julia` there is a corresponding ````` without any other ````julia` in between (unless you want to handle nested code blocks). If there are no ````julia` code blocks present in the markdown, an empty string is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,381],"elapsed":29.724745919,"_type":"aimessage"}]
