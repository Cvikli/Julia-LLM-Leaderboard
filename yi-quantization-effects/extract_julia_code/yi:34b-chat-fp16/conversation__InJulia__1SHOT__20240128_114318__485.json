It then iterates over each match, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, removes the code fences from the beginning and end of the content, and joins the code blocks together with a newline. Finally, it returns the extracted Julia code as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,355],"elapsed":27.518848141,"_type":"aimessage"}]
