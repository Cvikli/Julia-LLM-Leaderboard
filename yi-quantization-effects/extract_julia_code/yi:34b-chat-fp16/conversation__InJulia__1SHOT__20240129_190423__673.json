[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Below is an example of how you might implement such a function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regular expression to match code blocks with language \"julia\"\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"m\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the extracted code\n    output = \"\"\n\n    # Match all occurrences of the pattern in the markdown document\n    for match in eachmatch(pattern, md)\n        # Get the captured group, which is the content between the code fences\n        code_block = match.captures[1]\n\n        # Remove the leading and trailing newlines from the code block\n        clean_code_block = replace(code_block, r\"^\\n|\\n$\" => \"\")\n\n        # Append the clean code block to the output string\n        output *= clean_code_block * \"\\n\"\n    end\n\n    return output\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression to match all ````julia` code blocks in the markdown document. It then iterates over each match, removing the leading and trailing newlines from the captured code block, and concatenating them together with a newline character between each block. Finally, it returns the resulting string of joined code blocks.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no nested code blocks within the `julia` code blocks, and that there is only one language specified in the code fences (i.e., ````julia`) without any additional information or line breaks between the language name and the opening backtick. If your markdown documents contain nested code blocks or more complex structures, you may need to modify this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,387],"elapsed":30.057000071,"_type":"aimessage"}]
