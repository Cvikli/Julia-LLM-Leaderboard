Here's how you could implement the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Parse the Markdown document into an AST\n    ast = Markdown.parse(md)\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to hold the extracted Julia code\n    extracted_code = \"\"\n\n    # Traverse the AST and extract code blocks with language 'julia'\n    for node in ast\n        if node isa Markdown.Code\n            if node.language == \"julia\"\n                extracted_code *= replace(node.text, r\"^```julia\\n|\\n```$\" => \"\") * \"\\n\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Remove the trailing newline if present\n    return stripped_code = replace(extracted_code, r\"\\n+$\" => \"\")\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nmd_document = \"\"\"\n# This is a markdown document with Julia code blocks\n\n```julia\nfunction fibonacci(n)\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    for _ in 1:n\n        a, b = b, a + b\n    end\n    return a\nend\n```\n\nSome text here...\n\n```julia\nprintln(\"Hello, World!\")\n```\n\nMore text here...\n\"\"\"\n\nextracted_code = extract_julia_code(md_document)\n# The extracted code will be stored in `extracted_code`\nprintln(extracted_code)\n```\n\nIn this example, the function `extract_julia_code` is defined and used to extract Julia code blocks from a provided Markdown document. The `replace` functions are used to remove the leading and trailing ````julia\\n` and `\\n```` from each code block, and then all the extracted code blocks are joined together with newlines.\n\nPlease note that this example assumes there won't be any nested code blocks or other complex structures within the Markdown document. If your Markdown documents contain such structures, you may need to adjust the function to handle them properly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,550],"elapsed":17.542394238,"_type":"aimessage"}]
