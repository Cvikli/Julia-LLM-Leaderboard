[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

The function `extract_julia_code` takes a single argument `md::String`.\n2. It uses a regex to match code fences defined by `^(\\s*)(`{3,4})(\\s*)(\\S+?)\\s*\\n([\\s\\S]*?)\\s*(\\2)(`{3,4})(\\s*)$`.\n3. The function captures the following groups: before_fence, opening_delimiter, space1, language, content, space2, closing_delimiter, after_fence.\n4. Leading and trailing spaces are removed from the `content` using `replace(content, r\"^\\s+|\\s+$\" => \"\")`.\n5. Multiple newlines within the content are collapsed to a single newline using `replace(content, r\"\\n{2,}\" => \"\\n\")`.\n6. The output string is initialized as an empty string and code blocks are appended with a newline between them if there are multiple matches.\n7. The function returns the final output string.","status":200,"tokens":[396,536],"elapsed":17.57833391,"_type":"aimessage"}]
