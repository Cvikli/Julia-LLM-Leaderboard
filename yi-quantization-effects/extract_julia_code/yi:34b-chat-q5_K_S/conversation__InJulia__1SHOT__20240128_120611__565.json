It then iterates over these matches and concatenates each captured group (which contains the actual Julia code after removing the leading and trailing newlines) with a newline character. The result is a string containing all the extracted Julia code, with each code block separated by a newline.","status":200,"tokens":[0,343],"elapsed":10.886599661,"_type":"aimessage"}]
