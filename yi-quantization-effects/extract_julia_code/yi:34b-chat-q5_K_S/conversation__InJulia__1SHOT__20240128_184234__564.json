It then iterates over all matches, extracting the content between the code fences, removing the leading and trailing Julia fence indicators, and joining all the extracted code blocks together with a newline. Finally, it returns the combined string of all the extracted code.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes there are no nested code blocks and that each code block is correctly enclosed within ````julia` and `````. It also does not handle situations where the code blocks are split across multiple lines in the markdown document (which would require a more complex parsing strategy).","status":200,"tokens":[0,480],"elapsed":15.363513116,"_type":"aimessage"}]
