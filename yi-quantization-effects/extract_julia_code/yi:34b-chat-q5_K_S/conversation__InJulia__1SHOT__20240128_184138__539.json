Here's an example of how you might implement the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Parse the markdown document into an AbstractDict{String, Any}\n    doc = parse(md)\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to hold the extracted code blocks\n    julia_code = \"\"\n\n    # Loop over the parsed document looking for code blocks with language \"julia\"\n    for (name, node) in doc\n        if name == \"CodeBlock\" && node[\"language\"] == \"julia\"\n            # Remove the code fences and join the lines together\n            code_text = join(node[\"text\"][2:end-1], \"\\n\")\n            julia_code *= code_text * \"\\n\"  # Append with a newline to separate from other blocks\n        end\n    end\n\n    return julia_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Markdown` package's `parse` function to convert the Markdown string into an abstract dictionary representation. It then loops over this representation, looking for code blocks with the `\"language\"` key set to \"julia\". For each such block, it removes the leading and trailing backticks that are used for code fences (`````) and joins all the lines within the code block using a newline character. Finally, it concatenates all the extracted code blocks together, with an additional newline between them to ensure that they are separated.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no nested code blocks and that the input Markdown document is well-formed. It also assumes that there will be only one language specified as \"julia\" in the document, but it's easy to modify the function to handle multiple languages if needed.","status":200,"tokens":[85,451],"elapsed":14.517394062,"_type":"aimessage"}]
