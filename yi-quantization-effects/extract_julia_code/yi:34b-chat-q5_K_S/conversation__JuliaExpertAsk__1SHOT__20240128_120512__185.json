It then iterates over each line in the markdown document, appending lines that do not belong to a code block to an `extracted_code` string. Once a code fence is detected, it is ignored until the next one is found. After all lines have been processed, any leading tabs are removed from each line, and the code blocks are joined together with newlines. Finally, the code fences at the beginning and end of the extracted code are stripped to return just the Julia code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,475],"elapsed":15.151503131,"_type":"aimessage"}]
