Here's how you could write the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Parse the Markdown document into an AbstractDict{String, Any}\n    parsed = Markdown.parse(md)\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the extracted code\n    code = \"\"\n\n    # Traverse through the dictionary and find all `Code` blocks with language \"julia\"\n    for (k, v) in parsed\n        if k == \"Code\" && v[\"language\"] == \"julia\"\n            # Join the lines of each code block\n            code *= join(v[\"text\"]) * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Remove the leading and trailing newlines\n    return strip(code)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a `String` as input, parses it using `Markdown.parse`, and then finds all code blocks with the language set to \"julia\". It joins each line of these code blocks together with a newline and returns the resulting string without any leading or trailing newlines.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no nested code blocks and that the Markdown document is well-formed. If you have more complex Markdown documents, you might need to add additional logic to handle those cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,357],"elapsed":11.405745421,"_type":"aimessage"}]
