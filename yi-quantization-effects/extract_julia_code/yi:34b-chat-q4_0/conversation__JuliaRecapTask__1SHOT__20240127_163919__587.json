[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

If a line starts with `\"```julia\"`, indicating the start of a code block, we set a flag to indicate that we are inside a code block. For each subsequent line that does not start with a code fence, we append it to the output string, adding a newline character if necessary. Once we encounter a line that ends with three backticks (`````), signaling the end of a code block, we set the flag to indicate that we are no longer inside a code block.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the markdown document does not contain nested code blocks and that all code blocks are correctly delimited by matching pairs of code fences.","status":200,"tokens":[0,438],"elapsed":11.789135488,"_type":"aimessage"}]
