It then iterates over the matches, extracting the text between the opening and closing fence symbols (`````), and joins them together with a newline character. The leading and trailing fences are removed from each match before appending it to the output string.","status":200,"tokens":[115,330],"elapsed":8.913333072,"_type":"aimessage"}]
