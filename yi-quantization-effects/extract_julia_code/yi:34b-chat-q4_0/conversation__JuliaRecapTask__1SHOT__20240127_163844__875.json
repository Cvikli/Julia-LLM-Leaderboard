[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Here's an example of how to use the function:\n\n```julia\n# Write your markdown here\nmarkdown_doc = \"\"\"\nSome text before code block 1\n\n```julia\nlet x = 10; y = 20; z = 30 end\n```\n\nMore text after code block 1\n\n```julia\nfunction f(a, b)\n    c = a + b\n    return c\nend\nf(1, 2) # Output: 3\n```\n\nEven more text after code block 2\n\"\"\"\n\n# Call the function\nextracted_code = extract_julia_code(markdown_doc)\nprintln(extracted_code)\n# This should print out the julia code from both code blocks joined together with newlines\n```\n\nNote that this function assumes there are no nested code fences and that all `\"\\n\"` characters within a code block will be interpreted as literal line breaks. If you have more complex markdown with nested code blocks or if line breaks within code blocks need to be preserved, the logic would need to be adjusted accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[396,554],"elapsed":15.18426856,"_type":"aimessage"}]
