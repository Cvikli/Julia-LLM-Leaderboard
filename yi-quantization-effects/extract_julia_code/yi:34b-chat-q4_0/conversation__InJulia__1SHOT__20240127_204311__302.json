[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Below is an example of how you might implement such a function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # This regex matches a code block with a language identifier, capturing the code content inside.\n    # The `m` variable will hold a Match if the pattern matches in the input string.\n    m = match(r\"```julia([^\\n]+?)```\", md)\n    \n    if m !== nothing  # If there is at least one code block with \"julia\" language identifier\n        # Remove the leading and trailing `\\n` from the captured group (which contains the code content).\n        code_blocks = map(m.captures) do s\n            strip(s)  # Remove leading and trailing whitespace\n        end\n        # Join the code blocks together with a newline, without any additional whitespace.\n        joined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n        return joined_code\n    else\n        # If no matches were found, return an empty string.\n        return \"\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression to match code blocks with the `julia` language identifier. It captures the content inside the code block and then removes any leading and trailing whitespace from each captured group. Finally, it joins all the code blocks together without any additional whitespace. If no matches are found, it returns an empty string.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes the markdown document contains valid syntax with respect to code blocks. It also assumes that there may be multiple `julia` code blocks in the document, and it will return all of them concatenated together without any additional formatting or whitespace.","status":200,"tokens":[0,383],"elapsed":10.141198281,"_type":"aimessage"}]
