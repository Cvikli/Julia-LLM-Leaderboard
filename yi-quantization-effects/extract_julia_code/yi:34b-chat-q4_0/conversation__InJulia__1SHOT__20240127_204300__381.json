[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Below is an example of how you might implement such a function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Split the document into lines\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to hold the extracted code\n    extracted_code = \"\"\n\n    in_code_block = false\n    current_code_block = \"\"\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, r\"```julia\") || startswith(line, r\"```Julia\")\n            # Start of a code block\n            in_code_block = true\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if startswith(line, \"```\") && in_code_block\n            # End of a code block\n            in_code_block = false\n            current_code_block = join([current_code_block, line], \"\\n\")\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if in_code_block\n            # Add the line to the current code block\n            current_code_block *= line * \"\\n\"\n        else\n            # Not in a code block, just add the line\n            extracted_code *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return extracted_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the markdown document into lines and then iterating over them. When it encounters a line that starts with ````julia` or ````Julia`, it assumes the start of a code block and sets a flag to indicate this. When it encounters a line that starts with just three backticks (`````), it knows the end of the code block has been reached, and it processes the current code block by concatenating all its lines into a single string.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes the markdown document is well-formed and does not contain nested code blocks. It also assumes that there are no leading or trailing blank lines in the extracted Julia code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,452],"elapsed":11.979701584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
