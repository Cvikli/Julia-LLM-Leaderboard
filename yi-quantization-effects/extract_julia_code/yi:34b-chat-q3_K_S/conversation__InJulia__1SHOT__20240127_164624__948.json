Below is an example implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split on code fences (three backticks) to get each block\n    blocks = split(md, \"\\n\")[2:(end-1)] # Assume first line doesn't start with `\n    fences = findall(r\"^\\`\\`\\`julia\", md)\n\n    # Remove the code fences from the beginning of each line\n    for (i, b) in enumerate(blocks)\n        if i == 1 || blocks[i-1] != \"\\n\"\n            continue\n        end\n        start_pos = findfirst(r\"^\\`\\`\\`julia\", md)[1] + length(\"\\`\\`\\`julia\")\n        blocks[i] = replace(b, start_pos:start_pos => \"\")\n    end\n\n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    return join(blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function expects `md` to be a string containing Markdown content with Julia language code blocks. It first splits the document into lines and then finds all instances of `\\`\\`\\`julia` (code fence start for Julia in Markdown) to identify where each code block starts. It then removes the code fence markers from the beginning of each line, assuming that the first line doesn't start with a code fence and joining the remaining lines together into one string with newlines between them.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the markdown document is properly formatted with no extra spaces or unusual characters before the first code fence, and it does not handle nested code blocks or any other block elements within the code blocks (such as headers, lists, etc.).","status":200,"tokens":[0,411],"elapsed":10.91983652,"_type":"aimessage"}]
