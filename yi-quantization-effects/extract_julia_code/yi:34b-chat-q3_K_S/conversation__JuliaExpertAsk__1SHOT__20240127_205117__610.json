It uses regular expressions to match the start and end of each code fence, removes any leading and trailing whitespace from the matched code blocks, and then concatenates all the extracted code blocks into a single string without the code fence markers.","status":200,"tokens":[0,519],"elapsed":13.888180898,"_type":"aimessage"}]
