It does not validate the content of the code blocks or handle cases where the language is not specified correctly or if there are nested code blocks. For simple, well-formed Markdown documents with Julia code blocks, this function should work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[0,386],"elapsed":10.26076454,"_type":"aimessage"}]
