[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Below is an example of how you might write the `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```jl\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Create a Regex to match 3-backtick code fences with the \"julia\" language identifier\n    language_regex = r\"^(?:\\`\\`\\`([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+))\\n|\\```\\n\"\n    # Use sub to replace each matched line with an empty string\n    code_blocks = md |> strip |> strip_ansi_codes |> replace(language_regex => \"\")\n    # Split the document into lines\n    lines = split(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    # Remove leading and trailing whitespace from each line\n    cleaned_lines = map(strip, lines)\n    # Join the cleaned code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = join(cleaned_lines, \"\\n\")\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. It uses `strip` to remove leading and trailing whitespace from the markdown document (`md`).\n2. It removes ANSI escape codes using a custom function called `strip_ansi_codes`, which is not provided here but can be found in many places online.\n3. It replaces all instances of the 3-backtick code fences with the \"julia\" language identifier using a regular expression (`language_regex`) to match and remove those lines from the document.\n4. It splits the document into lines using `\\n` as the separator.\n5. It removes leading and trailing whitespace from each line in the array using `strip` again, applied to each element of the array with `map`.\n6. Finally, it joins these cleaned lines together with a newline character using `join`.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the markdown document contains only valid code blocks with the \"julia\" language identifier and no other types of code fences or blocks within them. It also assumes that the provided string is indeed a valid markdown document without any extra formatting that would interfere with the extraction process.","status":200,"tokens":[0,483],"elapsed":12.862282453,"_type":"aimessage"}]
