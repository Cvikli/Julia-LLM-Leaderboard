Here's how you could write such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regular expression for finding triple backticks followed by 'julia'\n    re = Regex(r`\\n?([```])(?:\\n|julia)\\n?`)\n\n    # Split the markdown document into lines, looking for code fences\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the extracted Julia code\n    code_blocks = String[]\n\n    # Loop through each line and extract code blocks\n    for (i, line) in enumerate(lines)\n        # If a line starts with three backticks followed by 'julia', it's a code fence start\n        if occursin(re, line)\n            # Initialize variables for the extracted code block\n            current_code = \"\"\n            in_code_block = true\n\n            # Find the matching closing code fence and append to current_code\n            while in_code_block\n                # If the next line starts with three backticks, it's the end of the code block\n                if occursin(r`\\n^([```])`, lines[i+1])\n                    in_code_block = false\n                end\n\n                # Append the line to the current code block\n                current_code *= \"\\n\" * line\n                if in_code_block\n                    line = lines[i + 1]\n                endif\n            end\n\n            # Remove the leading and trailing whitespace from the extracted code\n            current_code = replace(current_code, r\"^\\s+|\\s+$\" => \"\")\n            # Append the current code block to the list of code blocks\n            push!(code_blocks, current_code)\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Join all the extracted code blocks together with a newline\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function expects `md` to be a string containing the markdown document. It uses regular expressions to find code fence patterns and then joins the code blocks together by removing the leading and trailing whitespace as well as the code fence markers.","status":200,"tokens":[0,539],"elapsed":14.410566063,"_type":"aimessage"}]
