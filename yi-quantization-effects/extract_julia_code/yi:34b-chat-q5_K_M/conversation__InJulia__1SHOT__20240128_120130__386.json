Here's how you could implement `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Parse the markdown document into an AST\n    ast = Markdown.parse(md)\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the extracted code\n    extracted_code = \"\"\n\n    # Traverse the AST and find all code blocks\n    for node in ast\n        if isa(node, Markdown.Code) && node.lang == \"julia\"\n            # Remove the fences (```) from the beginning and end of the code block\n            code_text = replace(String(node.value), r\"^`{3}(\\s*)?|`{3}\\s*$\"m => s\"\")\n            # Join multiple code blocks with a newline\n            extracted_code *= \"\\n\" * code_text\n        end\n    end\n\n    return extracted_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a `String` containing the Markdown document and returns another `String` with all the Julia code blocks joined together. It does not handle nested code blocks or code blocks that are not properly formatted (e.g., if they don't start with three backticks). If you need to handle such cases, you would need a more sophisticated parsing approach.\n\nTo use this function, simply call it with your Markdown document:\n\n```julia\nmd_doc = \"\"\"\n# This is a markdown document\n\n```julia\nfunction myfun(x)\n    return x + 10\nend\n```\n\nMore text here...\n\n```julia\nmyfun(5)  # Call the function\n```\n\nAnd more text after that...\n\"\"\"\n\nextracted_code = extract_julia_code(md_doc)\nprintln(extracted_code)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```julia\nfunction myfun(x)\n    return x + 10\nend\n\nmyfun(5)  # Call the function\n```\n\nNote that this example assumes there are no errors in the Markdown document, and all Julia code blocks are properly formatted with `julia` as the language identifier.","status":200,"tokens":[0,564],"elapsed":18.453128265,"_type":"aimessage"}]
