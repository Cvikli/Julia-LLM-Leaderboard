The `next_non_empty_line` function is used to find the next non-empty line after a matched code block start.\n\nTo use this function, you simply pass in the markdown document string `md` and it will return the extracted Julia code as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[85,432],"elapsed":14.241978697,"_type":"aimessage"}]
