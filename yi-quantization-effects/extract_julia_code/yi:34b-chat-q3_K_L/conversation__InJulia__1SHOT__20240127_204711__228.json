[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Below is an example of how you might write such a function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Regular expression to match code blocks with language \"julia\"\n    pattern = r\"\\`\\`\\`julia[\\s\\S]+?\\`\\`\\`\"x\n    # Use a capture group to keep only the content between the code fences\n    code_blocks = match(pattern, md).captures[1]\n    # Join all the captured code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = join(code_blocks.split('\\n'), \"\\n\")\n    # Remove the leading and trailing code fences\n    return replace(joined_code, r\"```julia\" => \"\") |> replace(r\"```\" => \"\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by using regular expressions to match all code blocks with the `julia` language specified. It then captures the content between the code fences and joins them together with a newline character. Finally, it removes the leading and trailing code fence markers.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes the markdown document is well-formed and that each Julia code block is surrounded by ````julia` and `````. It also does not handle nested code blocks or code blocks with different numbers of blank lines between them. If these cases are expected, additional parsing might be required.","status":200,"tokens":[85,317],"elapsed":8.902058647,"_type":"aimessage"}]
