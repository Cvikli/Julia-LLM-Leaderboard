It creates a new column `ym` by extracting the year and month from each DateTime object using the `x.value` property, which gives direct access to the DateTypes.Date component of the DateTime (since Julia 1.7). Then it formats the result as an integer in the specified format \"yyyymm\" before concatenating them together with string concatenation (`*`) and assigning it to the new column `ym`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,255],"elapsed":8.126074847,"_type":"aimessage"}]
