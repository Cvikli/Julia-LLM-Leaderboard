It uses the dot notation to access the fields `year` and `month` of the DateTimes, and `string()` to convert them into a string representation. The `map()` function applies this transformation to each element of the `dt` column, and the result is stored in the new column `ym`. Finally, the modified DataFrame is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,180],"elapsed":6.666981596,"_type":"aimessage"}]
