It then concatenates them together as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\". The resulting vector is then used to create a new column `ym` in the DataFrame.\n\nThe function also includes a check to ensure that the extracted value does not exceed the maximum representable integer (2^31-1 for 32-bit systems) by comparing it to a large number (99999999) and replacing out-of-range values with `missing`. This is done using `ifelse` and a lambda function that takes advantage of broadcasting to apply the comparison and replacement on a row-by-row basis.","status":200,"tokens":[110,304],"elapsed":11.453898032,"_type":"aimessage"}]
