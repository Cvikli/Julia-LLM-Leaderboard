It then formats the month as a string with leading zeros to ensure a fixed width of 3 characters, concatenates them together as an integer using string concatenation, and assigns this new `ym` value back to the `DataFrame`. Finally, it returns the updated `DataFrame` with the new column added.","status":200,"tokens":[0,175],"elapsed":4.818937301,"_type":"aimessage"}]
