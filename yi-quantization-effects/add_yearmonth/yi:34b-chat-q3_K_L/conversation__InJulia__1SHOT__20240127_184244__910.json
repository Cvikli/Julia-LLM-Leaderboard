Below is a definition of the `add_yearmonth` function that you can use in Julia to extract the year and month from a DateTime column in a DataFrame and create a new column with the concatenated year and month as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\".\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    new_col = Vector{String}()\n    for date_time in eachrow(df)[!, :dt]\n        year = Dates.year(date_time)\n        month = Dates.month(date_time)\n        ym_str = string(year, lpad(month, 2, '0'))\n        push!(new_col, ym_str)\n    end\n    df[!, :ym] = new_col\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nTo use this function, you would call it with your DataFrame as an argument:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n# Your existing DataFrame with a DateTime column named 'dt'\ndf = ...\n\n# Call the add_yearmonth function\ndf = add_yearmonth(df)\n\n# Now df should have a new column 'ym' with concatenated year and month as an integer in \"yyyymm\" format\n```\n\nThis function iterates over each row of the DataFrame and extracts the year and month from the DateTime using the `Dates.year` and `Dates.month` functions, respectively. It then concatenates them together with leading zeros to ensure a length of 6 digits (for the \"yyyymm\" format) and appends the resulting strings to a new vector. Finally, it assigns this vector to a new column named 'ym' in the DataFrame.\n\nMake sure to install the `DataFrames` package if you haven't already by running:\n\n```julia\n]add DataFrames\n```\n\nwithin Julia's REPL (press `]`).","status":200,"tokens":[0,447],"elapsed":12.339738034,"_type":"aimessage"}]
