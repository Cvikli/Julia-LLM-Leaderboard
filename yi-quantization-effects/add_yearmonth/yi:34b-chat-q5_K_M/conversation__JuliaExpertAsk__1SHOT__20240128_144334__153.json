First, it coerces each DateTime into a string using the specified DateFormat. Then, it extracts the year and month components as integers. Finally, it concatenates these two values together in the desired format and assigns it to a new column `ym` in the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,159],"elapsed":5.162538122,"_type":"aimessage"}]
