Here's how you can create the `add_yearmonth` function that extracts the year and month from the `DateTime` column `dt` and concatenates them as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\":\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\nusing Statistics: year, month\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    # Define a new column of the same length as 'dt' to store the extracted year and month\n    ym = zeros(Int64, size(df, 1))\n\n    # Iterate over the rows of the DataFrame and extract year and month from each DateTime\n    for i in 1:size(df, 1)\n        ym[i] = string(year(df.dt[i])) * string(month(df.dt[i]))\n    end\n\n    # Create a new DataFrame with the 'ym' column appended to the original DataFrame\n    return vcat(df, DataFrame([ym], :auto))\nend\n```\n\nThis function assumes that `df` is a DataFrame with a column named `dt` containing `DateTime` values. It creates a new column `ym` by extracting the year and month from each element of `dt` using the `year` and `month` functions from the `Statistics` package, respectively. The result is then concatenated into a new DataFrame with the `ym` column appended to the original DataFrame using `vcat`.\n\nTo use this function, you simply need to pass your existing DataFrame as an argument:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\ndf = # Your DataFrame with 'dt' column\ndf2 = add_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThe resulting `df2` will have an additional column named `ym` containing the concatenated year and month in the format \"yyyymm\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,426],"elapsed":13.878772319,"_type":"aimessage"}]
