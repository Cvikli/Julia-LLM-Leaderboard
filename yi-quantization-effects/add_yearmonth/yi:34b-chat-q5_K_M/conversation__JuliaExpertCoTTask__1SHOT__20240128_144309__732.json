Then, it defines a function `add_yearmonth` that applies this conversion to each element of the `dt` column and adds the new column `ym` to the DataFrame. Finally, it verifies that the newly added column contains the expected values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,276],"elapsed":9.024314544,"_type":"aimessage"}]
