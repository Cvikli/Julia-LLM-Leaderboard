The transformation is achieved by calling the `string` function on the `DateTime` object's year and month components and then extracting the first six characters of the resulting string. This ensures that only the \"yyyymm\" part is retained.","status":200,"tokens":[110,184],"elapsed":6.145963275,"_type":"aimessage"}]
