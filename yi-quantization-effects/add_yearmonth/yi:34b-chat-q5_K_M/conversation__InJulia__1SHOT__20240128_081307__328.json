Below is a function that accomplishes this task:\n\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    new_column = Vector{Int64}()\n    for dt in df.dt\n        year = Int(year(dt))\n        month = Int(month(dt))\n        ym = year * 100 + month  # Concatenate as an integer\n        push!(new_column, ym)\n    end\n    df[!, :ym] = new_column  # Add the new column to the DataFrame\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a `DataFrame` `df` with a `DateTime` column named `dt` and creates a new column `ym` by extracting the year and month from each element in the `dt` column. The `year` and `month` functions are used to extract the year and month as integers, which are then concatenated using multiplication (`*`) to represent the year (e.g., 2023) and the month (e.g., 4 for April) without a leading zero. The resulting integer is in the format \"yyyymm\".\n\nThe new column is appended to the DataFrame using `df[!, :ym] = new_column`, which creates a new column with the specified name and populates it with the values from `new_column` vector. The `!` in the indexing operator tells Julia to modify the original DataFrame in place rather than creating a copy.\n\nTo use this function with your existing DataFrame, you would simply call:\n\n```julia\ndf = add_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThis will modify the DataFrame `df` by adding a new column named `ym` with the concatenated year and month for each row.","status":200,"tokens":[0,455],"elapsed":14.830632511,"_type":"aimessage"}]
