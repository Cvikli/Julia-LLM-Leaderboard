It then extracts the year and month components using the multiplication operator to convert them into an integer representing the concatenation of the year and month. Finally, it creates a new vector of strings with the formatted data and concatenates it as a new column to the DataFrame using `hcat` (horizontal concatenation).","status":200,"tokens":[0,201],"elapsed":9.015462128,"_type":"aimessage"}]
