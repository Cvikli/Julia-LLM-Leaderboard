It then applies element-wise parsing of the resulting strings into integer format using `parse(Int64, ...)`. Finally, it concatenates the year (e.g., \"2023\") with the month (e.g., \"05\") and assigns the result to a new column `ym` in the data frame. The leading zeros for months are preserved by formatting the month as a string with `* 100 + month(df.dt)` before parsing it back into an integer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,218],"elapsed":9.780151407,"_type":"aimessage"}]
