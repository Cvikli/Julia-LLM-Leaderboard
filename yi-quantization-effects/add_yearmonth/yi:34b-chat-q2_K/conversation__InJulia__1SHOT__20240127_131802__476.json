To extract the year and month from a `DateTime` column and convert it into a string format of \"yyyymm\", you can use the following function:\n\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:, :ym] = map(x -> (String(year(x)) * (String(month(x)) * 100), Int64), df.dt)\nend\n```\n\nHere's how you can use the function with your data frame:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nimport Dates\ndf = DataFrame(DT = [Dates.DateTime(2023, 1), Dates.DateTime(2023, 2)])  # Example DataFrame with a DateTime column\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThis will add a new column `ym` to your data frame that contains the year and month of each date in the format \"yyyymm\". Note that this operation is performed on an integer representation, not on the actual DateTime object, which is why we need to convert it back to a string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,277],"elapsed":7.104953954,"_type":"aimessage"}]
