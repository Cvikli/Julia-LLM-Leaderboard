It then creates a new column `ym` by extracting the year and month from each DateTime value in the `dt` column using the `yearmonth()` function provided by Julia's TimeZones ecosystem (which is imported implicitly if you have that package installed). The result is concatenated as an integer in format \"yyyymm\" and then assigned back to the DataFrame `df`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,154],"elapsed":3.971252164,"_type":"aimessage"}]
