We define a function `add_yearmonth` that takes in a DataFrame `df` as an argument.\n2. Inside the function, we create a new column named `ym` by using the existing `dt` column.\n3. We use the `map` function to apply a lambda function on each element of the `dt` column. The lambda function converts the date time to a string in the format \"yyyymm\" using the helper function `yrmm`, which we could define as needed or use an existing one if available.\n4. We return the updated DataFrame with the new column added.\n\n# Checking the Solution\n\nTo check that the solution is correct, you can inspect the output of the provided example usage:\n\n```julia\ndf[:ym] = add_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThe resulting `df` should have a new column `ym` with values corresponding to the concatenation of year and month in the format \"yyyymm\". For the provided data, it would look like this:\n\n| dt       | ym      |\n|----------|--------|\n| 2020-05-24 | 202005 |\n| 2021-01-15 | 202101 |\n| 2022-12-05 | 202212 |\n\nPlease note that the example usage assumes that `add_yearmonth` is called after defining it, which might not be the case depending on the context in which this task is given. If `add_yearmonth` is defined elsewhere and just needs to be applied to the provided data, then you would call it as follows:\n\n```julia\ndf = add_yearmonth(df)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,485],"elapsed":12.97214991,"_type":"aimessage"}]
