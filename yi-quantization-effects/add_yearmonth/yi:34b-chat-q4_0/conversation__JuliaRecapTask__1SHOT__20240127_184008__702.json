[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

If the `DateTime` is missing, the corresponding entry in the new column will be missing as well. The new column is then added to the data frame with the name `:ym`.\n\nTo use this function, you would simply call it on your `DataFrame`:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\n# Example DataFrame\ndf = DataFrame(dt = [DateTime(\"2023-01-01\"), missing, DateTime(\"2023-06-15\")])\n\n# Add the new column\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nAfter calling `add_yearmonth`, your data frame will have an additional column named `:ym` with the concatenated year and month for each non-missing date.","status":200,"tokens":[0,363],"elapsed":9.772029599,"_type":"aimessage"}]
