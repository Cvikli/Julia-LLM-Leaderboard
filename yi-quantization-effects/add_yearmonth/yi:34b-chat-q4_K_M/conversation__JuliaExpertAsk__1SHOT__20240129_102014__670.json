Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(x -> string(x[1], \"mm\")[1:7], df[:dt])\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `map` function to apply a anonymous function to each element of the `dt` column. The anonymous function extracts the year and month from the `DateTime` object using the `string` function with a custom format string \"mm\", which formats the month as a two-digit number (01-12). It then concatenates the year and month together as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\" by taking the first seven characters of the resulting string.\n\nThe `string(x[1], \"mm\")[1:7]` part is equivalent to extracting the year (four digits) from the DateTime object and then appending the two-digit month formatted as a string. The `[1:7]` slice selects only the first seven characters of the resulting string, which is the desired format \"yyyymm\".\n\nFinally, the new column `ym` is added to the DataFrame and the updated DataFrame is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,263],"elapsed":7.592998797,"_type":"aimessage"}]
