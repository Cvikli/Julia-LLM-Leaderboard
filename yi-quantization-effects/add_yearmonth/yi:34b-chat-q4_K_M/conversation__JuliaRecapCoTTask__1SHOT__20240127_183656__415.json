[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

The resulting vector of strings is assigned to the new column `ym` in the DataFrame.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the `dt` column contains valid DateTimes and that the year and month extraction logic is sufficient for your needs (e.g., it does not account for time zones or other DateTime components). If the input data is not consistent or if more complex parsing is required, you might need to adjust the function accordingly.\n\nIf you are working with large DataFrames, this operation may be memory-intensive due to the creation of a new column. You can consider performing this operation in batches or using more efficient indexing methods if needed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,259],"elapsed":7.440773828,"_type":"aimessage"}]
