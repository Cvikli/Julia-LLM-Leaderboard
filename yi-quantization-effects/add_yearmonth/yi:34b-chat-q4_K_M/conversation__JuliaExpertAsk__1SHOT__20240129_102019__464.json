The inner function extracts the year and month from the DateTime object using `x[1]` (which is the year) and then appends \"mm\" to get the month string. It then takes the substring starting from the second character up to the sixth, which gives us the two-digit month in the format \"mm\". Finally, it concatenates the year and month together as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,170],"elapsed":4.899404658,"_type":"aimessage"}]
