It then concatenates them together as a string in the format \"yyyymm\" using the `string` function. Finally, it assigns this new column to `df[!, :ym]`, which is a shorthand for adding a new column to the DataFrame without copying it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,150],"elapsed":4.318213268,"_type":"aimessage"}]
