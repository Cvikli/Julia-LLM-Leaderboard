Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To create a new column in a DataFrame by extracting the year and month from a `DateTime` column and concatenating them into an integer formatted as \"yyyymm\", you can use the following function:\n\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    new_col = Int64.(string.(df.dt) .|> byterun.(:) .|> x -> x[1:4] ⊕ (x[5:6] << 12))\n    return vcat(df, :ym => new_col)\nend\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the function:\n\n1. `string.(df.dt)` - Convert the `DateTime` column to a vector of strings.\n2. `byterun.(:)` - Apply the `byterun` function from the `BitBasics` package to each string, which converts the ASCII representation of the characters to bytes. This is necessary because we want to work with the raw bytes of the string to perform bitwise operations.\n3. `x -> x[1:4] ⊕ (x[5:6] << 12)` - Use a anonymous function to extract the first four characters (which represent the year) and the fifth and sixth characters (which represent the month) from each byte array. The `⊕` operator is used for bitwise OR, and `<<` is the left shift operator. We shift the month bytes 12 positions to the left to align them with the year bytes, then perform a bitwise OR to concatenate them into a single integer representing the year *and* month.\n4. `Int64(new_col)` - Convert the resulting vector of byte arrays back to an integer array.\n5. `vcat(df, :ym => new_col)` - Use `vcat` to concatenate the new column with the original DataFrame, creating a new column named \"ym\". The function `:ym => new_col` is used to specify the name of the new column and its corresponding value (the newly created integer array).\n\nTo use this function, simply call it on your `DataFrame`:\n\n```julia\nusing BitBasics # if you haven't already imported this package\ndf_with_ym = add_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThis will add a new column named \"ym\" to the DataFrame with values in the format \"yyyymm\". Note that `df` should be a valid `DataFrame` object with a column named `dt` containing `DateTime` values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,566],"elapsed":16.118890241,"_type":"aimessage"}]
