Here's how you can define the function to extract the year and month from the `dt` column and concatenate them into a new column `ym`:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    # Define a new vector to hold the year-month strings\n    ym = Vector{String}(undef, length(df))\n\n    # Iterate over each row of the DataFrame and extract year and month\n    for (i, row) in enumerate(eachrow(df))\n        dt = row.dt # Get the date-time value from the current row\n        if !ismissing(dt) # Check if the date-time is not missing\n            ym[i] = string(Dates.year(dt)) * string(Dates.month(dt)) # Concatenate year and month\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Create a new column in the DataFrame with the extracted year-months\n    df.ym = ym\n    return df\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nusing DataFrames\ndf = DataFrame(dt = [missing, Dates.Date(2023, 1, 1), Dates.Date(2023, 2, 28)])\nadd_yearmonth(df) # Apply the function to the DataFrame\n```\n\nIn this example, `ym` is a vector of strings where each string is in the format \"yyyymm\". The function checks if the date-time value in each row is missing before extracting the year and month to prevent errors when dealing with missing values. After creating the new column, the function returns the updated DataFrame.\n\nMake sure to import `Dates` at the beginning of your code so that you can use the `Date` and `Month` types within the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,449],"elapsed":12.725048106,"_type":"aimessage"}]
