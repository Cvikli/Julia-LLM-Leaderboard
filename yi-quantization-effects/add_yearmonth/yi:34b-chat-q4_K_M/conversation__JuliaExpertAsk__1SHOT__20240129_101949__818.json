The anonymous function splits the string representation of the date using hyphens and takes the first two elements (year and month), then concatenates them together with \"mm\" to form the desired format. Finally, it converts the result back to an integer by calling `string()`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,148],"elapsed":4.258497387,"_type":"aimessage"}]
