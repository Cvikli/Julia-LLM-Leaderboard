The anonymous function extracts the year and month from the `DateTime` column `dt` using indexing and then concatenates them together as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\". The `string` function is used to convert the year and month into strings, and `lpad` is used to pad the month with zeros if it's a single-digit number. Finally, the result is assigned back to the DataFrame as a new column named `ym`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,189],"elapsed":5.445841901,"_type":"aimessage"}]
