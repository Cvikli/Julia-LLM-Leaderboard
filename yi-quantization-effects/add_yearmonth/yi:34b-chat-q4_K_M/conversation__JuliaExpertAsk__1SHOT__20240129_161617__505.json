It extracts the year and month from the `DateTime` objects in the `dt` column using the dot syntax to access properties, then concatenates them together as an integer string in the format \"yyyymm\". Finally, it assigns this new column to `df[!, :ym]` to create a new column named \"ym\" with the formatted year and month.","status":200,"tokens":[110,153],"elapsed":4.577368634,"_type":"aimessage"}]
