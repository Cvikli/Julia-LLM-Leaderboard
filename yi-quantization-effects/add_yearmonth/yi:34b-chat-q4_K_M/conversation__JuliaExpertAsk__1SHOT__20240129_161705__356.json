The inner map extracts the year and month from each DateTime in the `dt` column using the `year` and `month` properties of the DateTimes. It then returns a tuple containing these values. The outer map takes this tuple and applies string interpolation to concatenate the year with leading zeros for the month, resulting in a string in the format \"yyyymm\". Finally, it assigns this new column to `df` as `ym`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,187],"elapsed":5.39109296,"_type":"aimessage"}]
