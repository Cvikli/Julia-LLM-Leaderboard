[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

It iterates over each row of the DataFrame and extracts the year and month from the DateTime in that row. The year is concatenated with the two-digit representation of the month to form a string in the format \"yyyymm\".\n\nThe resulting strings are then converted back into integers using `parse(Int64, x, base=10)`. This step is necessary because the strings might not be valid integer representations (e.g., if the year is less than 100). If the string cannot be parsed as an integer, it is set to `missing`.\n\nThe function uses the `@transform` macro from the DataFrames package to apply these transformations in a vectorized way, which is more efficient than using loops. The `ByRow` wrapper is used to ensure that the operation is applied row by row, and the `if-else` statement is used to handle cases where the string cannot be parsed as an integer.\n\nPlease note that this function does not check for invalid DateTimes or months greater than 12. It assumes that the input DataFrame has been properly cleaned and formatted.","status":200,"tokens":[11,436],"elapsed":12.883762276,"_type":"aimessage"}]
