It first converts each DateTime to a Date object, then extracts the year and month, concatenates them together as a string in the format \"yyyymm\", and finally parses that string into an integer. The result is assigned to a new column `ym` in the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,154],"elapsed":4.348526762,"_type":"aimessage"}]
