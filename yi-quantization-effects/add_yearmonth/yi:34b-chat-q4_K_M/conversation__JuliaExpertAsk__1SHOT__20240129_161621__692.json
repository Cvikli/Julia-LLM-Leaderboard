It extracts the year and month from each DateTime object using the `x.year` and `x.month` syntax, then concatenates them together as a string in the format \"yyyymm\". Finally, it assigns this new column named `ym` to the DataFrame and returns the updated DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,141],"elapsed":4.058517567,"_type":"aimessage"}]
