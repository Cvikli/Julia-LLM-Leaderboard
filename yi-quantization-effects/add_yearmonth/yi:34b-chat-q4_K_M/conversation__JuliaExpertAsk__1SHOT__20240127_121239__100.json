It first converts the dates to a vector of `Date` type, then maps a function over this vector to create an array containing the year and month components concatenated together as strings. Finally, it converts this array back to a vector of `Date` type for easier concatenation and adds the new column to the `DataFrame`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,273],"elapsed":7.722913042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
