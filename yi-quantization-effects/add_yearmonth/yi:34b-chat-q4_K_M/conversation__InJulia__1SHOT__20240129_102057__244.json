The following function will extract these values and concatenate them as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\".\n\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    new_col = Vector{Int64}()\n    for dt in eachrow(df)[!, :dt] # Iterate over the dates in the column\n        push!(new_col, string(dt.year, lpad(string(dt.month), 2, '0')))\n    end\n    return new_col\nend\n```\n\nThis function assumes that `df` is a DataFrame with a column named `:dt` containing `Date` values. It creates a new vector of integers where each element is the concatenation of the year and month in the format \"yyyymm\".\n\nTo use this function, simply call it on your DataFrame and add the resulting vector as a new column:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\ndf = # Your dataframe with DateColumn\nnew_col = add_yearmonth(df)\ndf[!, :ym] = new_col\n```\n\nThis will create a new column `:ym` in the DataFrame `df` that contains the year-month integers. Note that the type of the new column is `Vector{Int64}` because we are concatenating strings to form an integer representation of the year and month.","status":200,"tokens":[0,347],"elapsed":10.033278695,"_type":"aimessage"}]
