Extracts the dates from the `DateTime` column as `Date` objects using `Date.(df.dt)`.\n2. Calculates the year and month of each date as integers using `Year.(dates)` and `Month.(dates)`.\n3. Concatenates the year and month strings together using a pipeline (`|>)`) with intermediate steps to convert them to strings, join them without any separator, parse them back to integers, and concatenate them into a vector of integers in the format \"yyyymm\".\n4. Assigns this new column `ym` to the DataFrame.\n5. Returns the updated DataFrame.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\n# Example DataFrame with a DateTime column\ndf = DataFrame(dt = [DateTime(\"2023-01-01\"), DateTime(\"2023-02-01\"), DateTime(\"2023-03-01\")])\n\n# Apply the function to add a new ym column\ndf_with_ym = add_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nAfter running this code, `df_with_ym` will have an additional column `:ym` with values in the format \"yyyymm\".","status":200,"tokens":[80,525],"elapsed":15.390059413,"_type":"aimessage"}]
