It then uses `floor` to round down the year to the nearest whole number (since `Int` does not have a fraction part), and concatenates the year with 100 times the month as an integer to ensure that the resulting string is in the format \"yyyymm\". Finally, it maps this transformation over each element in the column and assigns it to a new column `ym` in the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[110,181],"elapsed":14.051450021,"_type":"aimessage"}]
