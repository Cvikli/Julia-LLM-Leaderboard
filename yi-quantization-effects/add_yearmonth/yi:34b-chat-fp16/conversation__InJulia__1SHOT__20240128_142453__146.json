Below is a function that does this for you:\n\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    # Extract the dates as Date objects\n    dates = convert(Vector{Date}, df.dt)\n    \n    # Calculate the year and month for each date\n    years = [string(year(date)) for date in dates]\n    months = [string(month(date)) for date in dates]\n    \n    # Concatenate year and month into a string in \"yyyymm\" format\n    ym_strings = vcat(years, months)\n    ym_ints = parse.(Int64, ym_strings)\n    \n    # Create a new column with the concatenated values\n    df[!, :ym] = ym_ints .* 100 + (ym_ints .- 1 * length(years))\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function assumes that your `dt` column contains valid DateTime objects. It first converts the dates to Date objects because it's easier to work with years and months using just Dates. Then, it calculates the year and month for each date, concatenating them into a string in \"yyyymm\" format. Finally, it creates a new column `ym` by parsing the strings into integers and adding them to the DataFrame.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\n# Example DataFrame with a DateTime column named 'dt'\ndf = DataFrame(dt=DateTime[DateTime(2023, 1, 1), DateTime(2023, 2, 1)])\n\n# Call the add_yearmonth function\nnew_df = add_yearmonth(df)\n\n# The new column 'ym' should have been added\nnew_df.ym  # => Int64[202301, 202302]\n```\n\nPlease note that the `add_yearmonth` function assumes that there are no missing dates in your DataFrame and that the `dt` column contains valid DateTime objects. If you have missing data or if the types of the `dt` column do not match the expected type, you may need to handle those cases within the function.","status":200,"tokens":[80,540],"elapsed":41.966235446,"_type":"aimessage"}]
