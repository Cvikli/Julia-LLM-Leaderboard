It then maps over each element of the column, extracting the year and month components, concatenates them as an integer string in the format \"yyyymm\", and assigns it to a new column `ym` in the DataFrame. The `!` in `[!, :ym]` indicates that the function should modify the original DataFrame in place.","status":200,"tokens":[0,164],"elapsed":12.729757632,"_type":"aimessage"}]
