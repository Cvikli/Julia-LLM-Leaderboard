Since the example data does not have a `ym` column yet, we would see an error if we try to access it directly. However, after applying the function, the DataFrame should have a new column named `ym` with values like \"202005\", \"202101\", and \"202212\".","status":200,"tokens":[248,196],"elapsed":38.352615863,"_type":"aimessage"}]
