The transformation calculates the year and month of each `DateTime` object and concatenates them as an integer string in the format \"yyyymm\" using the `string` function.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the `df` provided is indeed a valid DataFrame with the `dt` column containing `DateTime` values. If the `df` were to be empty or if the `dt` column contained other types of data, the function would need to handle those cases accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,257],"elapsed":19.957506676,"_type":"aimessage"}]
