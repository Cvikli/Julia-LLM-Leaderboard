The transformation is done by extracting the year and month components from the `DateTime` using dot syntax and then concatenating them into a string with leading zeros for the month if necessary (since months are 1-based, but we want them to be 01-09 format).\n\nHere's how you can use this function on your DataFrame:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n# Assuming df is your DataFrame with a DateTime column 'dt'\ndf = add_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThis will create a new column `ym` in the DataFrame that contains the year and month concatenated as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,284],"elapsed":22.001826863,"_type":"aimessage"}]
