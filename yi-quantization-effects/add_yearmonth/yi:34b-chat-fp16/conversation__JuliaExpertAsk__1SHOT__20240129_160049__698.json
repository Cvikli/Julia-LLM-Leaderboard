The transformation itself is encapsulated within an anonymous function that takes a DateTime object `x` and extracts the year and month components, flooring them to integers before concatenating them together as a string in the desired format.","status":200,"tokens":[0,136],"elapsed":10.526526403,"_type":"aimessage"}]
