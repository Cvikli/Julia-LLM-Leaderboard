Below is an example of how to write a function that does this:\n\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    # Extract the column 'dt' as a Vector{DateTime}\n    dt = df[:, :dt]\n    \n    # Initialize the new column 'ym' with the same size as 'dt'\n    ym = zeros(Int64, length(dt))\n    \n    # Iterate over the elements of 'dt' and concatenate year and month into a string\n    for (i, date_time) in enumerate(dt)\n        # Extract the year and month\n        year = Int(string(date_time)[1:4])\n        month = Int(string(date_time)[6:7])\n        \n        # Concatenate them into a string\n        ym_str = string(year, month)\n        \n        # Convert the string to an integer and store it in 'ym'\n        ym[i] = parse(Int64, ym_str)\n    end\n    \n    # Add the new column 'ym' to the DataFrame\n    df[:, :ym] = ym\n    \n    return df\nend\n\n# Example usage with a hypothetical DataFrame\nusing DataFrames\ndf = DataFrame(dt = [DateTime(\"2023-01-01\"), DateTime(\"2023-02-01\"), DateTime(\"2023-03-01\")])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThis function first extracts the `dt` column from the DataFrame and then iterates over each element to extract the year and month. It concatenates them into a string, converts that string to an integer, and stores it in the new `ym` column. Finally, it adds the `ym` column back to the DataFrame and returns the updated DataFrame.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the `dt` column is a Vector of DateTime objects. If the `dt` column has a different type or structure, you may need to adjust the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[80,507],"elapsed":39.502579424,"_type":"aimessage"}]
