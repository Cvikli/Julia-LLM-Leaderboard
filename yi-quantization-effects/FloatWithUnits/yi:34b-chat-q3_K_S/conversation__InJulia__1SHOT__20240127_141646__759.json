For example:\n\n```julia\njulia> FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nPlease note that the `Show` method uses the default printer (`print()`) to print both fields of the struct. If you want to use a different separator or formatting, you can do so by changing the string passed to `print()`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,223],"elapsed":5.890877942,"_type":"aimessage"}]
