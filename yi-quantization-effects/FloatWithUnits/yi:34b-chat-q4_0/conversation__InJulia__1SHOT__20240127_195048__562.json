The `IO` argument in `show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)` is an abstract supertype for all types that can represent I/O streams (like standard output or error). In this case, we are just printing the value followed by a space and then the unit.\n\nRemember to import `Base.show` at the beginning of your code if you plan to use it outside of the module where the struct is defined.","status":200,"tokens":[0,274],"elapsed":7.241012965,"_type":"aimessage"}]
