[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a struct `FloatWithUnits` with fields `value` and `unit` (make sure to define it!), write a `show` method for it that will concatenate the value and unit with a space like this \"1.8 meters\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits <: AbstractFloat\n    value::Number\n    unit::AbstractString\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\nend\n```\n\nThis code defines a new struct `FloatWithUnits` that inherits from the abstract type `AbstractFloat`, which means it can be used in many places where floating-point numbers are expected. It has two fields: `value`, which is any number, and `unit`, which is a string representing the unit of measurement.\n\nThe `Base.show` method is overridden to customize how instances of `FloatWithUnits` are displayed when printed to an `IO` stream (e.g., the console or a file). It simply concatenates the value with a space and then the unit string.\n\nRemember to always include a `begin` and `end` around multi-line definitions, such as the struct definition and the function definition. This is not strictly necessary for single-line definitions like the one for `show`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,250],"elapsed":6.994858759,"_type":"aimessage"}]
