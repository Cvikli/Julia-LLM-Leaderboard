It also provides a custom `show` method that takes an `IO` object (often just `stdout`) as the first argument and a `FloatWithUnits` instance as the second argument. The `show` method then prints the value followed by a space and the unit.","status":200,"tokens":[0,158],"elapsed":4.348267594,"_type":"aimessage"}]
