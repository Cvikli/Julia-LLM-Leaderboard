The first argument `io` is an instance of `IO` (e.g., `STDOUT`), and the second argument `fwu` is an instance of `FloatWithUnits`.\n3. `print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)`: This is the body of the `show` method where we print the value and unit separated by a space.\n\nNow you can use this struct like any other type in Julia, and when you call `show` on an instance of `FloatWithUnits`, it will display the value and unit as desired.","status":200,"tokens":[0,311],"elapsed":11.526907672,"_type":"aimessage"}]
