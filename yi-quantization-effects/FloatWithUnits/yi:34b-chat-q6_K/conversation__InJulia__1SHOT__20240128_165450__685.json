Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\nend\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `struct FloatWithUnits` defines a new struct type with two fields: `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`.\n- The `Base.show` function is a method that takes an instance of the `IO` type (often just `STDOUT`) as its first argument, and the object to be printed as the second argument.\n- Inside the function body, we use `print(io, ...)` to concatenate and print the value and unit with a space between them.\n\nNow you can create instances of this struct and use `show` to display them:\n\n```julia\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nThe output will be in the format \"value unit\", just as you specified.","status":200,"tokens":[0,309],"elapsed":11.444428244,"_type":"aimessage"}]
