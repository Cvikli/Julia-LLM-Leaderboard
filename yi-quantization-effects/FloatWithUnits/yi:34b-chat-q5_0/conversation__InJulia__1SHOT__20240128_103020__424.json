Define the struct with the necessary fields.\n2. Implement the `Base.show` method within an anonymous function to display the value and unit as desired.\n3. Use `@inline` to make the method more efficient.\n4. Make sure to import `Base.show` so that you can override it.\n\nHere's how you would do this:\n\n```julia\nimport Base.show\n\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\n@inline function show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\nend\n```\n\nNow you can create instances of `FloatWithUnits` and use them as follows:\n\n```julia\njulia> a = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n\njulia> b = FloatWithUnits(3.5, \"kilograms\")\n3.5 kilograms\n```\n\nWhen you print an instance of `FloatWithUnits` to the console or any other output stream, it will display the value and unit as specified in the `show` method.","status":200,"tokens":[0,299],"elapsed":9.472913992,"_type":"aimessage"}]
