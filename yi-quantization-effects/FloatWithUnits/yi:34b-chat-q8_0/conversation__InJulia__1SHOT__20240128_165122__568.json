First, let's define the `FloatWithUnits` struct:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n```\n\nNow, we need to write a custom `show` method for this struct. The `show` function is used for printing objects to the console. We'll define it within the base namespace since we want this behavior for all instances of `FloatWithUnits`.\n\n```julia\nBase.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits) = print(io, \"$(fwu.value) ${(fwu.unit)}\")\n```\n\nThis custom `show` method will take an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and a stream (usually the console) as parameters, and it will print the value followed by a space and then the unit using string interpolation.\n\nHere's how you can use it:\n\n```julia\njulia> FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nThis should give you the desired output of \"1.8 meters\" when printing an instance of `FloatWithUnits`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,265],"elapsed":11.894023425,"_type":"aimessage"}]
