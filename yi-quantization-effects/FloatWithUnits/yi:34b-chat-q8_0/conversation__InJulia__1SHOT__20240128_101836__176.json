Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\nend\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- The `struct` statement defines the `FloatWithUnits` type with two fields: `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`.\n- The `Base.show` method is a Julia function that is used to define how an object of a certain type should be displayed when printed to the console or another output stream.\n- Inside the `show` method, we use `print(io, ...)` to concatenate and print the value followed by a space and then the unit. The `IO` argument is a reference to the output stream (usually the console).\n\nNow you can create instances of `FloatWithUnits` and they will be displayed as desired:\n\n```julia\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nYou can also define more methods for `FloatWithUnits` if you need to handle different operations with these values, such as addition, subtraction, etc.","status":200,"tokens":[0,347],"elapsed":15.571357591,"_type":"aimessage"}]
