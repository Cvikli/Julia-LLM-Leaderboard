Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n```\n\nNow, let's write a custom `show` method for this struct that will display the value and unit concatenated with a space.\n\n```julia\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\nend\n```\n\nHere's how you can use it:\n\n```julia\njulia> FloatWithUnits(2.5, \"meters\")\n2.5 meters\n```\n\nThe `Base.show` method is a generic function that takes an `IO` stream as its first argument and the object to be displayed as its second argument. We overload this method for our `FloatWithUnits` struct by specifying the types of both arguments (`::IO` and `::FloatWithUnits`). Inside the function body, we use string interpolation to concatenate the value and unit with a space before printing them to the `IO` stream.\n\nNote that when you define your own `show` method, it's important to include the line `print(io, ...)` or `println(io, ...)` to actually display the output to the user.","status":200,"tokens":[0,331],"elapsed":14.851398255,"_type":"aimessage"}]
