The `show` function is used for printing values nicely when displaying them in the REPL or when they are serialized to a string elsewhere.\n\nHere's how you would define it:\n\n```julia\nBase.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits) = print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\n```\n\nNow we can use the `FloatWithUnits` type as follows:\n\n```julia\njulia> FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nThis will output \"1.8 meters\" as specified in the task description.","status":200,"tokens":[0,208],"elapsed":5.346512309,"_type":"aimessage"}]
