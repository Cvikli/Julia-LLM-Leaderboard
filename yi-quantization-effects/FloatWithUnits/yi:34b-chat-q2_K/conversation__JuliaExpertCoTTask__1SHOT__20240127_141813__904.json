The `show` method is called automatically when you print a `FloatWithUnits` object to the console or save it to a file.\n\nHere's how you might define the `show` method:\n\n```julia\nBase.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits) = print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\n```\n\nNow, let's test this with the provided data:\n\n```julia\nFloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\") |> show\n# Output: 1.8 meters\n```\n\nThis output shows that our `show` method is working as expected, displaying the value and unit concatenated with a space.","status":200,"tokens":[197,228],"elapsed":10.489642459,"_type":"aimessage"}]
