The `show` function is used to display the contents of an object when it is displayed by Julia's print statement or other printing functions. Here's how you can define the `show` method for `FloatWithUnits`:\n\n```julia\nBase.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits) = print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\n```\n\nThis method simply takes an `IO` object (which is a stream to which the output will be written) and then prints out the value followed by a space and the unit.\n\nNow you can use this struct as follows:\n\n```julia\njulia> FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nWhen you print a `FloatWithUnits` object to the console, it will display the value and unit as specified in the `show` method.","status":200,"tokens":[0,263],"elapsed":6.712440672,"_type":"aimessage"}]
