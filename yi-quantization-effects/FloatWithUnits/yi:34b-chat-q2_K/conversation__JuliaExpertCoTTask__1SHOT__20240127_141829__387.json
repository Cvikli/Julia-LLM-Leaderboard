The `show` function is used to convert a value into a string representation, which in this case should be a concatenation of the value and unit.\n\nHere's how we can define it:\n\n```julia\nBase.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits) = print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\n```\n\nNow let's test our `FloatWithUnits` and its string representation:\n\n```julia\njulia> FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nAs you can see, the output is exactly what we expected: \"1.8 meters\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,226],"elapsed":5.789863319,"_type":"aimessage"}]
