It then uses `print` to concatenate the value with the unit string, inserting a space between them.\n\nHere's how you can use it:\n\n```julia\njulia> FloatWithUnits(2.5, \"kilograms\")\n2.5 kilograms\n```\n\nNotice that the `show` method automatically inserts a space after the value when printing to ensure the output looks like \"1.8 meters\" rather than \"1.8meters\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,222],"elapsed":7.206011227,"_type":"aimessage"}]
