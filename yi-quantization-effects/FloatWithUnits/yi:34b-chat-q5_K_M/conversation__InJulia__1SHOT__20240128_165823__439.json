Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\nend\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `struct FloatWithUnits` defines a new struct type with two fields: `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`.\n- The `Base.show` method is defined as a function that takes an `IO` object (often just `stdout`) as the first argument and an instance of `FloatWithUnits` as the second argument (`fwu::FloatWithUnits`).\n- Inside the `show` method, we use `print(io, ...)` to concatenate and print the `value` followed by a space and then the `unit`. The `print` function writes its arguments separated by spaces to the given `IO` stream.\n\nNow, when you create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and call `show` on it, it will be printed in the format \"1.8 meters\" as desired:\n\n```julia\njulia> using Base.Dates\n\njulia> now_with_time = Dates.now();\n\njulia> println(now_with_time) # This is how you normally print a variable\n2023-05-19T07:46:18.219\n\njulia> my_float_with_unit = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\");\n\njulia> println(my_float_with_unit) # This is how you print a custom type with the `show` method defined above\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nRemember to import `Base.Dates` if you're working with dates and times, as in the example above.","status":200,"tokens":[0,499],"elapsed":16.288106836,"_type":"aimessage"}]
