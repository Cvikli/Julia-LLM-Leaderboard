Here's how you could do it for the `FloatWithUnits` struct:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\nend\n```\n\nNow when you create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and call `display` or `println` on it, the value will be printed with its unit:\n\n```julia\njulia> using .MyModule  # If FloatWithUnits is defined in a module named MyModule\n\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nIn this example, `Base.show` is overloaded to take an `IO` object (often `stdout`) as the first argument and the `FloatWithUnits` instance as the second argument. Inside the function body, it prints the value followed by a space and then the unit.\n\nRemember to define the `FloatWithUnits` struct in your Julia code before you can use this `show` method. If the struct is defined in a module, you need to import or prepend the module name when using the struct (as shown in the example with `using .MyModule`).","status":200,"tokens":[0,335],"elapsed":10.897804443,"_type":"aimessage"}]
