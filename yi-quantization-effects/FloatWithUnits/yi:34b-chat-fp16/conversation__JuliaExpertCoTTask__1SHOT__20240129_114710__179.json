It then overloads the `show` method from the `Base` module to customize how instances of `FloatWithUnits` are displayed when printed to an `IO` stream. The implementation simply concatenates the value with a space followed by the unit string.\n\nTo test this, you can use Julia's interactive prompt (`julia>`) or create a script and run it:\n\n```julia\njulia> FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nThis output shows that the `show` method is working as expected, displaying the value and unit separated by a space.","status":200,"tokens":[0,239],"elapsed":18.561425474,"_type":"aimessage"}]
