For example:\n\n```julia\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nRemember that you need to import `Base.show` so that you can overload it for your custom type. The `IO` argument in the method signature is an instance of `IOStream` (e.g., `STDOUT`) and allows you to write to the output stream. The `::IO` part after `io` in the method signature is a type annotation that tells Julia what kind of object `io` should be.\n\nYou can also define a function to create instances of `FloatWithUnits` more conveniently:\n\n```julia\nfunction FloatWithUnits(value::Number, unit::String)\n    return FloatWithUnits(float(value), unit)\nend\n```\n\nThis allows you to construct `FloatWithUnits` objects like this:\n\n```julia\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nInstead of having to call `float` explicitly when constructing the object:\n\n```julia\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(float(1.8), \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nThis is just a basic example. You might want to add more functionality to your struct and its methods depending on your specific needs, such as handling different types of units or providing conversion functions.","status":200,"tokens":[0,482],"elapsed":37.401725747,"_type":"aimessage"}]
