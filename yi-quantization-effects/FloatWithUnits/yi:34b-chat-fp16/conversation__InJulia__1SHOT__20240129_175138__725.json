The first argument `io::IO` represents an I/O stream (e.g., `STDOUT`), and the second argument `fwu::FloatWithUnits` is the instance of your struct that you want to print.\n3. `print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)` writes the value of the `value` field followed by a space and then the `unit` field to the I/O stream `io`. This is what will be displayed when you call `show` on an instance of `FloatWithUnits`.\n\nNow, you can create instances of your struct and use `show` or related functions to print them in the desired format:\n\n```julia\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n\njulia> println(fwu)\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nRemember that when defining a custom `show` method, you should always call the supertype's `show` function if you want to preserve the default behavior for any fields that your struct does not override. In this case, since we are overriding the entire display of the struct, there is no need to do so.","status":200,"tokens":[0,470],"elapsed":36.494564573,"_type":"aimessage"}]
