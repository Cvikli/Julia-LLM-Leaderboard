Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\njulia> x = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nIn the `show` function, we pass an `IO` object as the first argument and the instance of `FloatWithUnits` as the second argument. We then print the value followed by a space and the unit.\n\nMake sure to import the `Base.show` method from the Base module using `using Base: show` if you want to use the `@show` macro in your code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,229],"elapsed":17.734434425,"_type":"aimessage"}]
