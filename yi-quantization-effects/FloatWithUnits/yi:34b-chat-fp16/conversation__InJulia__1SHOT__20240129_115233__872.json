This is known as a \"type-stable printing method\" and allows you to control how instances of your struct are printed when using `display` or `println`.\n\nFirst, let's define the `FloatWithUnits` struct:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n```\n\nNow, we can implement the `show` method for this struct:\n\n```julia\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes an `IO` object (which is a stream to which the output will be written) and a `FloatWithUnits` instance as arguments. It then prints the value followed by a space and the unit to this stream.\n\nYou can test your implementation by creating an instance of the struct and printing it:\n\n```julia\njulia> using Printf\n\njulia> meters = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n\njulia> println(meters)\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nThe `using Printf` statement is necessary to ensure that the `println` function is defined. Without it, you would get an error because `Base.println` does not exist in Julia by default.","status":200,"tokens":[0,346],"elapsed":26.809879129,"_type":"aimessage"}]
