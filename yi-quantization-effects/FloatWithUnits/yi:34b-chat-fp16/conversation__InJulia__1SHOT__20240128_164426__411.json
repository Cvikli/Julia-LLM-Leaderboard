Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\nend\n```\n\nNow when you create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and call `display` or `println` on it, the value and unit will be printed out as you've specified. For example:\n\n```julia\njulia> float_with_units = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nThis method is part of the `Base` module because it overrides a function from the standard library. The `show` method is used when printing objects to the console or when writing them to files.\n\nRemember that if you're using Julia 1.6 or later, you should use `println` instead of `print` to ensure that the output includes a newline character:\n\n```julia\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    println(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\nend\n```\n\nThis will give you:\n\n```julia\njulia> float_with_units = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nwhich includes a newline character at the end of the string.","status":200,"tokens":[75,401],"elapsed":31.105578423,"_type":"aimessage"}]
