The `show` method is used to format the output when printing an object to the console. We can define it like this:\n\n```julia\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\nend\n```\n\nHere, `Base.show` is a Julia function that takes an `IO` object (which represents the output stream) and the `FloatWithUnits` instance as arguments. We then print the value followed by a space and the unit.\n\nNow you can use your `FloatWithUnits` struct like this:\n\n```julia\njulia> float_with_units = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nWhen you print an instance of `FloatWithUnits`, the custom `show` method will be called, and it will display the value and unit as desired.","status":200,"tokens":[0,285],"elapsed":22.122074252,"_type":"aimessage"}]
