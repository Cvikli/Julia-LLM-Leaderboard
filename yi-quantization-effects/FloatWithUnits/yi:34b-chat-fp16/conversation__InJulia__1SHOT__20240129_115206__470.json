The body of the function should return a string or write to the stream in a way that represents the object as desired.\n\nHere's how you can define the `FloatWithUnits` struct and its corresponding `show` method:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\nend\n```\n\nNow you can create instances of `FloatWithUnits` and use them as follows:\n\n```julia\njulia> x = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n\njulia> println(x)\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nThe `Base.show` method is used to define how the object should be displayed when printed or passed to a function that expects a string representation of the object. In this case, it simply concatenates the value and unit with a space.","status":200,"tokens":[0,297],"elapsed":23.005347354,"_type":"aimessage"}]
