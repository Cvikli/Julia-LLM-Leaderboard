Define the struct with appropriate fields.\n2. Implement the `Base.show` method within an anonymous function to display the value and unit.\n3. Use the `repr` function to format the numbers before displaying them.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, repr(fwu.value) * \" \" * fwu.unit)\nend\n```\n\nNow you can use this struct as follows:\n\n```julia\njulia> FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nThe `repr` function is used to ensure that the value is printed in a format that looks like an expression that could be copy-pasted into the REPL and evaluated to give back the original object. This is particularly useful for numbers with significant figures, as it will preserve the precision of the number when printing.\n\nRemember to import `Base.show` if you are writing a package or want to use this method in a different namespace:\n\n```julia\nimport Base.show\n\nfunction show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    # Your custom code here\nend\n```\n\nThis will ensure that the `show` method is accessible within the desired context.","status":200,"tokens":[75,355],"elapsed":11.422477436,"_type":"aimessage"}]
