The `show` method is used to print out an object when it is displayed in the REPL or when it is passed to `print`, `display`, or `println` functions.\n\nHere's how you can define the `show` method for your `FloatWithUnits` struct:\n\n```julia\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\nend\n```\n\nThis `show` method takes an `IO` object (which is a stream of characters) and the `FloatWithUnits` instance as arguments. It then prints out the value followed by a space and the unit using the provided `io`.\n\nNow, when you create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and try to print it, it will display as \"1.8 meters\" as desired:\n\n```julia\njulia> float_with_units = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nRemember to import `Base.show` if you want to use the `print` function or similar functions that rely on the default `show` method.\n\n```julia\nusing Base: show\n```\n\nWith this custom `show` method, any code that uses `println`, `display`, or `print` will now display `FloatWithUnits` objects in the desired format.","status":200,"tokens":[0,380],"elapsed":12.064501103,"_type":"aimessage"}]
