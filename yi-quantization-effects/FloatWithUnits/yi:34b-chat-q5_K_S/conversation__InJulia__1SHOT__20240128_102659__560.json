The `show` method receives an `io` (an I/O stream) as its first argument, which we can use to write to the console or any other output destination.\n\n```julia\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\nend\n```\n\nThis `show` method simply concatenates the value with a space and then prints the unit. Now when you create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and call `show` on it, it will print the combined string:\n\n```julia\njulia> FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nYou can also use this struct with other I/O functions that expect a string representation of an object, such as `println` or `display`, and it will work as expected:\n\n```julia\njulia> println(FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\"))\n1.8 meters\n\njulia> display(FloatWithUnits(2.5, \"kilograms\"))\n2.5 kilograms\n```","status":200,"tokens":[75,333],"elapsed":10.729047445,"_type":"aimessage"}]
