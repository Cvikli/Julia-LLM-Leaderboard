It then overloads the `show` method from the `Base` module to print out the value and unit when an instance of `FloatWithUnits` is displayed. The `show` method simply concatenates the value with a space followed by the unit string.\n\nTo test this, you can create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and then call `println(fwu)` or use it in a print statement to see how it's displayed:\n\n```julia\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n\njulia> println(\"The length is: \", fwu)\nThe length is: 1.8 meters\n```\n\nAs you can see, when the `println` function is used with an instance of `FloatWithUnits`, it correctly displays the value and unit separated by a space.","status":200,"tokens":[0,299],"elapsed":9.511693103,"_type":"aimessage"}]
