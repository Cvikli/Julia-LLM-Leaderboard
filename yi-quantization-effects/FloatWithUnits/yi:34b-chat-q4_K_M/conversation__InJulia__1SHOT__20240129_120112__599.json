Inside the function, you can use string interpolation to format the value and unit as desired.\n\nHere's an example of how you might define your `FloatWithUnits` struct and a custom `show` method for it:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, x::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(x.value) $(x.unit)\")\nend\n```\n\nNow you can create instances of `FloatWithUnits` and use them as follows:\n\n```julia\njulia> using Printf\n\njulia> meters_per_second = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters/second\")\n1.8 meters/second\n\njulia> printf(\"The speed is %s\\n\", meters_per_second)\nThe speed is 1.8 meters/second\n```\n\nThe `printf` function is used to format the output string with the desired formatting specifiers. In this case, `%s` is used to insert a string. The `Printf` package must be imported for this functionality.","status":200,"tokens":[0,314],"elapsed":9.058647454,"_type":"aimessage"}]
