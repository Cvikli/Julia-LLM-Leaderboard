The `show` function is used to format and print objects in Julia. Here's how you can define the `show` method:\n\n```julia\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\nend\n```\n\nThis `show` method takes an `IO` object (like `STDout`) and a `FloatWithUnits` instance as arguments. It then prints the value followed by a space and the unit to that `IO` stream.\n\nNow, you can use this new type and its `show` method:\n\n```julia\njulia> FloatWithUnits(2.5, \"meters\")\n2.5 meters\n```\n\nAs you can see, when we print a `FloatWithUnits` object, it now shows the value followed by the unit.","status":200,"tokens":[75,261],"elapsed":7.523894265,"_type":"aimessage"}]
