We define a new struct `FloatWithUnits` with two fields: `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`.\n2. We create a custom function named `show` (this is the method that gets called when you print an object) with two parameters: `io`, which is an instance of `IO` (an abstract supertype for all input/output devices like displays and files), and `fwu`, which is an instance of our `FloatWithUnits` struct.\n3. Inside the function, we use `print(io, ...)` to write the value followed by a space and then the unit to the output stream `io`.\n\nNow, when you create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and try to print it, it will display the value with its unit as requested:\n\n```julia\njulia> using Base.Meta\n\njulia> struct FloatWithUnits\n           value::Float64\n           unit::String\n       end\n\njulia> function Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n           print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\n       end\n\njulia> my_float_with_units = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nIn the last line, we create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` with a value of 1.8 and a unit of \"meters\", and then print it to see how the custom `show` method works.","status":200,"tokens":[0,461],"elapsed":13.334226638,"_type":"aimessage"}]
