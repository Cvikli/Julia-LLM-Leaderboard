The following code defines the `FloatWithUnits` struct and its corresponding `show` method:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\nend\n```\n\nThe `Base.show` method takes an `IO` object (often just `stdout`) as the first argument and the `FloatWithUnits` instance as the second argument. It then prints the value followed by a space and the unit to the output stream.\n\nHere's how you can use it:\n\n```julia\njulia> FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nThis will print `1.8 meters` as desired.","status":200,"tokens":[0,249],"elapsed":7.172385693,"_type":"aimessage"}]
