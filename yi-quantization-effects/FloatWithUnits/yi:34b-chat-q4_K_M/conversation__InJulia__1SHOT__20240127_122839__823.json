Define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with appropriate fields.\n2. Override the `Base.show` method to control how instances of this struct are printed when displayed.\n\nHere's an example implementation:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\nend\n```\n\nThis `show` method takes an `IO` object as its first argument (which is used for printing) and a `FloatWithUnits` instance as its second argument. It then prints the value followed by a space and the unit.\n\nNow, when you create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and call `display(fwu)` or `println(fwu)`, it will output something like \"1.8 meters\" as desired.","status":200,"tokens":[0,239],"elapsed":6.74129398,"_type":"aimessage"}]
