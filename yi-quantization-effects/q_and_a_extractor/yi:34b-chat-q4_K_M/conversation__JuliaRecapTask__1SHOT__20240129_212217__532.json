[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n\n    for (i, line) in enumerate(eachline(md))\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            question_start = i\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            push!(questions, strip(join(md[question_start:i-1])))\n            answer_start = i\n        end\n\n        if !in_question && line != \"\\n\"\n            push!(answers, strip(line))\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (questions[end], answers[end])\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each line of the markdown text. When it encounters a line starting with `# Question`, it starts collecting the following lines until it finds one starting with `# Answer`. The question is then stripped of leading spaces and newlines and added to an array. The process repeats for the answer section.\n\nAfter all sections have been processed, the last element of the arrays for questions and answers are returned as a tuple.\n\nTo use this function, simply call it with your markdown text:\n\n```julia\nmd_text = \"\"\"# Question\n    What is the meaning of life?\n    \n# Answer\n    Life's purpose is to perpetuate the species and to ensure the continuation of biological evolution. This is achieved through reproduction, survival, and adaptability. Additionally, individuals may find personal meanings in their lives that can range from simple existence to achieving goals, helping others, or creating something lasting. The meaning of life is a deeply philosophical question that has been discussed by thinkers for centuries, and it often carries different connotations for each individual.","status":200,"tokens":[0,413],"elapsed":12.171550668,"_type":"aimessage"}]
