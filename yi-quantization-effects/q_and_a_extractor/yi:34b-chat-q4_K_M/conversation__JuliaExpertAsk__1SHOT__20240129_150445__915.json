It maintains a state variable `current_section` to track whether it's in the `# Question` or `# Answer` section. When a new question or answer starts, the corresponding array is reset. The `strip.(split(line, \"\\n\"))` removes leading spaces and newlines from each line before storing it in the arrays. Finally, the first question and answer are returned as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,280],"elapsed":8.087034414,"_type":"aimessage"}]
