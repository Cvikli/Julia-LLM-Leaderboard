It uses regular expressions to find all instances of `# Question` and `# Answer` in the markdown text. The `findall` function returns the indices of these sections within the text. Then it constructs two arrays, one with the indices of the questions and another with the indices of the answers. \n\nThe actual extraction is done by taking the substring of the `md` text that lies between the question and answer indexes. The `strip` function is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from each element in the arrays. Finally, it checks if the number of questions matches the number of answers and returns a tuple with the first matching pair. If there's no match or an error, such as the number of questions not being equal to the number of answers, `nothing` is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,485],"elapsed":14.090139034,"_type":"aimessage"}]
