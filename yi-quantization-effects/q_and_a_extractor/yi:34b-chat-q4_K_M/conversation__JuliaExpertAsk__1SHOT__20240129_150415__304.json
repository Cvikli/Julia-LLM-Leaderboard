If so, it appends the stripped line to the corresponding array (`questions` or `answers`). The `strip` function is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from each line.\n\nThe `current_section` variable keeps track of which section we are in (either `:question` or `:answer`), and it's initialized to `:none` at the beginning. If a `# Question` line is encountered when we're not in the `:question` state, it means we've started a new question, so we push the first question to the array. Similarly, for `# Answer` lines.\n\nFinally, after iterating over all lines, the function returns a tuple containing the first question and answer extracted from the markdown text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,352],"elapsed":10.18523535,"_type":"aimessage"}]
