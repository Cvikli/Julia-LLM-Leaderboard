[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n    current_section = :none\n\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            current_section = :question\n            continue\n        end\n        if startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            current_section = :answer\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if current_section == :question\n            questions = append!(questions, strip(line))\n        elseif current_section == :answer\n            answers = append!(answers, strip(line))\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (questions[1], answers[1])\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each line in the `md` string and checking if it starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If so, it sets the current section accordingly. For each question or answer, it appends the stripped line to the respective array. After processing all lines, it returns a tuple containing the first question and answer.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes there is exactly one question and one answer in the markdown text. If there are multiple questions and answers, you would need to modify the function to handle them accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,297],"elapsed":8.720238528,"_type":"aimessage"}]
