[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

It then iterates over each line in the markdown text, building up lists of questions and answers. The answer text is read line by line until another `# Answer` or an empty line is encountered.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes the `md` string contains valid markdown with properly formatted `Question` and `Answer` sections. It also assumes that there are no nested `Question` or `Answer` sections within a single set of questions and answers.\n\nTo use this function, simply call it with your markdown text as an argument:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nHow does Julia handle multiple dispatch?\n\n# Answer\nJulia's multiple dispatch system is one of its most powerful features. It allows methods to be defined for generic functions that are selected at runtime based on the types of all arguments. This enables a high degree of flexibility and code reuse, as well as the ability to define behaviors specific to combinations of types.
