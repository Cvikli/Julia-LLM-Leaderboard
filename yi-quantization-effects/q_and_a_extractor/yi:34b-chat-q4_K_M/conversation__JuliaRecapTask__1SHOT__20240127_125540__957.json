[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

When it encounters a line starting with \"# Question\", it sets the current position as the start of the question section and continues reading until it reaches a line starting with \"# Answer\" or the end of the document. The question is extracted by collecting all lines between the headers.\n\nSimilarly, when it finds a line starting with \"# Answer\", it does the same for the answer section. Both questions and answers are stored in separate arrays and then returned as a tuple.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes there are no nested question/answer sections within the same hierarchy level. If such cases need to be handled, the algorithm would need to be more complex to parse the markdown structure accurately.","status":200,"tokens":[412,689],"elapsed":20.140425232,"_type":"aimessage"}]
