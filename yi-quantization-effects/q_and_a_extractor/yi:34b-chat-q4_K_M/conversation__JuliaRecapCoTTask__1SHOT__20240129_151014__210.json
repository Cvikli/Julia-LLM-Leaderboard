[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n    current_section = :none\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if occursin(\"# Question\", line)\n            current_section = :question\n            continue\n        end\n        if occursin(\"# Answer\", line)\n            current_section = :answer\n            continue\n        end\n        if current_section == :question\n            questions = push!(questions, strip(line))\n        elseif current_section == :answer\n            answers = push!(answers, strip(line))\n        end\n    end\n    return (questions[1], answers[1])\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each line in the markdown text and checking if it starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`. If so, it updates a section variable to indicate which type of section is being processed. For each question and answer section, it appends the stripped text of subsequent lines to separate arrays. After processing the entire document, it returns the first question and answer as a tuple.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes there is exactly one question and one answer per `# Question` and `# Answer` header, respectively. If there are multiple questions or answers, you would need to modify the function to handle them accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,311],"elapsed":9.138639445,"_type":"aimessage"}]
