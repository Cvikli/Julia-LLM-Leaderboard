[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

When a `# Question` or `# Answer` header is encountered, the corresponding level is increased, and if a number follows the header, the question/answer dictionary is updated with the current level as the key. The body of each question and answer is then appended to the corresponding entry in the dictionaries until another header of the same level is found or the end of the document is reached.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no nested questions or answers (i.e., `# Question` and `# Answer` headers at the same level). If such cases exist, additional logic would be required to handle them properly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,553],"elapsed":16.388967203,"_type":"aimessage"}]
