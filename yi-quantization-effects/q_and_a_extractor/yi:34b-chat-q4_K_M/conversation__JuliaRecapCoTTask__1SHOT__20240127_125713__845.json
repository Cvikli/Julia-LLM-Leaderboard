[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Defines regular expressions to find `# Question` and `# Answer` headers in the markdown text.\n2. Iterates over each line of the markdown document and extracts questions and answers using the regular expressions.\n3. Handles cases where there are multiple lines or nested lists within an answer by concatenating them with a newline character.\n4. If there are multiple answers to a single question, it joins these answers into one string, maintaining proper indentation for readability.\n5. Finally, it returns a tuple of the extracted questions and answers.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes the markdown document is well-formed and follows the expected structure with `# Question` and `# Answer` headers. It also assumes that each question has at least one corresponding answer. If an answer spans multiple lines or contains nested lists, it will be correctly processed and concatenated into a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,901],"elapsed":26.097283558,"_type":"aimessage"}]
