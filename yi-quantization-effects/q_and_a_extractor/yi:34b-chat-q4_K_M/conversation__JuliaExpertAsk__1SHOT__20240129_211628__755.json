It maintains a state variable `current_section` to track whether it's in the \"Question\" or \"Answer\" section. When a new section is detected, the function continues processing lines until the end of the current section. The questions and answers are collected into separate arrays and then joined back together before being returned as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,261],"elapsed":7.5487524,"_type":"aimessage"}]
