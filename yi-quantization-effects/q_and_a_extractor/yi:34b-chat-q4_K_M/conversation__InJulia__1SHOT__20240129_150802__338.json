Here's an example of how you might implement such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n    current_question = \"\"\n    current_answer = \"\"\n\n    # Regex to match the start of a question section\n    question_start = r\"^# Question\\s*$\"m\n    # Regex to match the start of an answer section\n    answer_start = r\"^# Answer\\s*$\"m\n\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if occursin(question_start, line)\n            current_question = strip(line)\n        elseif occursin(answer_start, line)\n            current_answer = strip(line)\n        else\n            # If we're in the answer section, append the line to the current answer\n            if !isempty(current_answer)\n                current_answer *= \"\\n\" * strip(line)\n            end\n            # If we're at the end of a question-answer pair and have content, add it to the result\n            if isempty(questions) && isempty(answers) && !isempty(current_question) && !isempty(current_answer)\n                push!(questions, current_question)\n                push!(answers, current_answer)\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (questions = questions, answers = answers)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Markdown Q&A Example\n\n## Question: What is the meaning of life?\n\nLife has no inherent meaning. The meaning of life is what you give it. It's up to each individual to determine what their life means to them. Some people find meaning in achieving personal goals, helping others, or contributing to society. The search for meaning can be a lifelong journey and can change over time as individuals grow and experience different things.\n\n## Answer: How do I extract questions and answers from this text?\n\nYou can use regular expressions to match the start of each question and answer section. Then, you can parse the text between these sections to extract the questions and answers. Make sure to strip any leading whitespace and newlines to ensure clean output.\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\nprintln(\"Questions:\")\nfor question in result.questions\n    println(question)\nend\nprintln(\"Answers:\")\nfor answer in result.answers\n    println(answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function will extract the questions and answers from the provided markdown text, stripping leading spaces and newlines as requested. It then returns a tuple with two arrays: one for the questions and another for the answers. The example usage demonstrates how to use the function with an input `md_text` and print out the extracted questions and answers.","status":200,"tokens":[0,706],"elapsed":20.59256845,"_type":"aimessage"}]
