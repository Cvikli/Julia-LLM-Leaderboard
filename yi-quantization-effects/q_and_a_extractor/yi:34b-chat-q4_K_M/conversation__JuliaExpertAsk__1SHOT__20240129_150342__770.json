It maintains a state variable `current_section` to track whether it is in the `# Question` or `# Answer` section. When a line starts with `# Question`, the state is set to `:question`, and when a line starts with `# Answer`, it is set to `:answer`. All lines that do not start with either of these headers are then appended to the corresponding list of questions or answers after stripping leading whitespace and newlines. Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the joined question text and answer text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,314],"elapsed":9.072615342,"_type":"aimessage"}]
