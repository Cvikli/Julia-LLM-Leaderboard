It matches both single-line and multi-line headings using two sets of patternsâ€”one for each level of markdown heading (e.g., `# Heading` and `## Heading`). Once a question is found, the function searches for the corresponding answer until another question or the end of the text is encountered. The result is a dictionary where the keys are the questions and the values are the answers. Finally, it returns a tuple of all valid question-answer pairs.","status":200,"tokens":[0,464],"elapsed":13.19023558,"_type":"aimessage"}]
