[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Given the task description and special instructions provided:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = Regex(r\"^#\\sQuestion\\s+(.+)\", \"m\")\n    answers = Regex(r\"^#\\sAnswer\\s+(.+)\", \"m\")\n    results = []\n\n    for match in eachmatch(questions, md)\n        question = strip(match.captures[1])\n        for answer_match in eachmatch(answers, md, searchstart(md, match.offset + match.length))\n            answer = strip(answer_match.captures[1])\n            push!(results, (question, answer))\n            break # We only want the first answer for each question\n        end\n    end\n\n    return results\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer` in the markdown text. For each question found, it captures the text until the next `# Answer` or the end of the document. The `strip` function is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\nThe `eachmatch` function is used to iterate over all matches for both questions and answers, ensuring that we don't miss any content if there are multiple answers per question. The `searchstart` function is used to adjust the search position after finding a match for `# Question` to start searching from the end of its matched string.\n\nFinally, the results are collected into a list of tuples where each tuple contains a question and its corresponding answer. If there are multiple answers for one question, only the first answer is returned.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no nested questions or answers within the same section, i.e., `# Question` and `# Answer` headers do not appear within each other's content.","status":200,"tokens":[0,420],"elapsed":12.107952003,"_type":"aimessage"}]
