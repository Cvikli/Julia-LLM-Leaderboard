Here's an example of how you might implement such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = Vector{String}()\n    answers = Vector{String}()\n\n    # Regexes to match the start of question and answer sections\n    question_re = r\"^# Question\\s*$\"\n    answer_re = r\"^# Answer\\s*$\"\n\n    # Iterate over each line in the markdown text\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if match(question_re, line) !== nothing\n            # If we find a question header, start collecting the answer\n            start_of_answer = findnext(r\"\\S\", line, nextind(line, 7))  # Skip over \"Question\" and whitespace\n            if start_of_answer !== nothing\n                # Collect the answer until we reach the next header or the end of the text\n                answer = strip(join(md[start_of_answer..end], \"\\n\"))\n                answerspush!(answer)\n            end\n        elseif match(answer_re, line) !== nothing\n            # If we find an answer header, start collecting the question\n            start_of_question = findnext(r\"\\S\", line, nextind(line, 7))  # Skip over \"Answer\" and whitespace\n            if start_of_question !== nothing\n                # Collect the question until we reach the previous header or the beginning of the text\n                question = strip(join(md[1:start_of_question.prevind()], \"\\n\"))\n                questionspush!(question)\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (questions=questions, answers=answers)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question 1\nWhat is the meaning of life?\n\n# Answer 1\nThe meaning of life is a philosophical question concerning the significance of living or existence in general.\n\n# Question 2\nWhy did the bicycle fall over?\n\n# Answer 2\nThe bicycle fell over because it was two-tired!\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Questions:\")\nfor question in result.questions\n    println(question)\nend\nprintln(\"Answers:\")\nfor answer in result.answers\n    println(answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function splits the markdown text into lines, then uses regular expressions to detect the start of question and answer sections. It skips over the `# Question` and `# Answer` headers and any leading whitespace to find the actual content of each section. The text is stripped of leading spaces and newlines using the `strip()` function before being appended to the respective vector.\n\nPlease note that this example assumes there are no nested questions or answers within the same header sections, and that each question and answer starts on a new line after the corresponding header. If your markdown text has more complex structures, you may need to modify the regexes and logic accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,758],"elapsed":22.158232431,"_type":"aimessage"}]
