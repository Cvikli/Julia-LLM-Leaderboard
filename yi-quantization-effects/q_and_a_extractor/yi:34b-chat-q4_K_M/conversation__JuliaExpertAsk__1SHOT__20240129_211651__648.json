It maintains a state variable `current_section` to keep track of whether it's in the `# Question` or `# Answer` section. When a new question or answer is detected, it appends the stripped text to the respective arrays. To include all following text until the next section, an empty line is added to the questions array when a new question begins.\n\nThe function returns a tuple containing the first question and its corresponding answer. If no questions and answers are found, it returns a message indicating so.","status":200,"tokens":[0,469],"elapsed":13.65403517,"_type":"aimessage"}]
