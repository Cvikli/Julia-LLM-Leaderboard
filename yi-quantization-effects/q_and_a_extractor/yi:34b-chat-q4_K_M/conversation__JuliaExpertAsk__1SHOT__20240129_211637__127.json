When it encounters a line starting with `# Question`, it adds the line to an array of questions and sets the current section to `:question`. When it finds a line starting with `# Answer`, it starts collecting the answers in another array and sets the current section to `:answer`.\n\nAfter processing all lines, the function ensures that for each question, the corresponding answer is also included in the array of answers. Finally, it returns the first question and its corresponding answer as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,301],"elapsed":8.715655393,"_type":"aimessage"}]
