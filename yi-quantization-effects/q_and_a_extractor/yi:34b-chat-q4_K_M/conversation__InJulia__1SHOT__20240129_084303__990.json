When it encounters a line starting with `# Question` or `# Answer`, it toggles the corresponding state (`in_question` and `in_answer`). When in the question mode, it appends each line to the `question` variable until it switches to answer mode or reaches an empty line. The same process is done for the answer section. After collecting all questions and answers, it trims the leading spaces and newlines from the text and returns the first question and answer as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[104,407],"elapsed":17.25973867,"_type":"aimessage"}]
