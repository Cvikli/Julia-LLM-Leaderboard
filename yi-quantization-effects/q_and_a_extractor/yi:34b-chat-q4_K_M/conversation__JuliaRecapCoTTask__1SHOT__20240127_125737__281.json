[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    answers = Vector{Tuple{String, String}}()\n\n    # Use a regex to match both Question and Answer headers\n    question_regex = r\"^# Question\\s*$\"m\n    answer_regex = r\"^# Answer\\s*$\"m\n\n    # Split the markdown text into lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n\n    # Iterate over each line\n    for (i, line) in enumerate(lines)\n        # Check if the line matches the Question header regex\n        if occursin(question_regex, line)\n            # Start a new question block\n            q_start = i\n        end\n\n        # Check if the line matches the Answer header regex\n        if occursin(answer_regex, line)\n            # Store the previous start index of the question block\n            push!(answers, (lines[q_start:i-1] |> join, lines[i+1:end] |> join))\n            # Reset the start index for a new answer\n            q_start = i + 1\n        end\n    end\n\n    return answers\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by using regular expressions to match the `# Question` and `# Answer` headers in the markdown text. It then splits the text into lines and iterates over them, keeping track of the start index for each question block. When an answer header is encountered, it stores the corresponding question and answer in a tuple and resets the start index for the next question block.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is at least one instance of `# Question` and `# Answer` in the markdown text and that each question is followed by an answer without any other headers interrupting the flow. If multiple answers follow a single question, they will be concatenated together.","status":200,"tokens":[0,421],"elapsed":12.123115957,"_type":"aimessage"}]
