Here's how you might implement such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n    current_question = \"\"\n    current_answer = \"\"\n\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            # Start of a new question\n            if current_question != \"\"\n                push!(questions, strip(current_question))\n                push!(answers, strip(current_answer))\n            end\n            current_question = \"\"\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            # Start of a new answer\n            current_answer = \"\"\n        else\n            if line != \"\\n\"  # Ignore empty lines\n                if current_question != \"\"  # Append to the current question\n                    current_question *= \" \" * line\n                elseif current_answer != \"\"  # Append to the current answer\n                    current_answer *= \" \" * line\n                else  # Start a new question or answer if not in the middle of one\n                    error(\"Unexpected line: $line\")\n                end\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    if current_question != \"\"\n        push!(questions, strip(current_question))\n        push!(answers, strip(current_answer))\n    end\n\n    return questions, answers\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses `eachline` to iterate over the lines of the markdown text. It maintains two strings: `current_question` and `current_answer`. When it encounters a line starting with `# Question` or `# Answer`, it takes appropriate action based on whether it's in the middle of a question or answer block.\n\nThe function returns a tuple containing arrays of questions and answers. The `strip` functions are used to remove leading spaces and newlines from each extracted text.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use this function:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"# Markdown Example\n\n# Question: What is the capital of Japan?\n东京是日本的首都。","status":200,"tokens":[0,541],"elapsed":15.711883542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
