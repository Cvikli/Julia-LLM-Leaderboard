[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In this task, we will use Julia's built-in Markdown parsing capabilities to extract the text between `# Question` and `# Answer` headers in a markdown document. We will then strip leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text to clean it up.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    questions = [r\"^# Question\\s+(\\S+)\" => \"Question: $1\",\n                 r\"^# Answer\\s+(\\S+)\" => \"Answer: $1\"]\n    answers = []\n\n    for (pattern, replacement) in questions\n        question_match = match(pattern, md)\n        if question_match !== nothing\n            answer_start = findnext(r\"^# Answer\\s*\", md, nextind(md, question_match.offset))\n            if answer_start === nothing\n                error(\"Could not find corresponding # Answer for $question_match\")\n            end\n            answer_length = search(md, \"\\n# Question\", answer_start.offset) - 1\n            answer = strip(sub(replacement => \"\", md, answer_start.offset, answer_start.offset + answer_length))\n            answers = [Answer(a) for a in answers]\n            push!(answers, Answer(answer))\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question=answers[1].question, answer=answers[2].answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over a set of regular expressions that match the `# Question` and `# Answer` headers in the markdown text. For each matched header, it finds the next occurrence of the other header to determine the start of the answer section. It then strips leading whitespace and newlines from the answer text using `strip()` before appending the answer to a list. Finally, it returns a tuple with the first question's text as the key and the second answer's text as the value.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use this function:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question 1\nSome context here...\n\n# Answer 1\nThe answer to question 1 is very interesting.\n\n# Question 2\nAnother question?\n\n# Answer 2\nYes, the second answer is equally fascinating.\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: $(result.question)\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $(result.answer)\")\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, you should see something like:\n\n```plaintext\nQuestion: Question 1\nAnswer: The answer to question 1 is very interesting.\n```\n\nPlease note that the function assumes that there are exactly two questions and answers in the markdown text provided. If there are more or fewer, you may need to modify the function to handle those cases appropriately.","status":200,"tokens":[0,662],"elapsed":19.553962536,"_type":"aimessage"}]
