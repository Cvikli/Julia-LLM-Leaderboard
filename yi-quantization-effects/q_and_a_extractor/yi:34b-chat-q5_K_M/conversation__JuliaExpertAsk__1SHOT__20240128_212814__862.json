It then splits the markdown text into lines and loops through each line, checking if it matches the `# Question` regex to start a new answer section or if it matches the `# Answer` regex to end an answer section. If neither regex is matched, the current line is appended to the answer string with leading spaces and newlines stripped. Once an `# Answer` is found or the end of the text is reached, the function returns a tuple containing the question (the last non-empty line before the answer) and the answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,499],"elapsed":16.338398065,"_type":"aimessage"}]
