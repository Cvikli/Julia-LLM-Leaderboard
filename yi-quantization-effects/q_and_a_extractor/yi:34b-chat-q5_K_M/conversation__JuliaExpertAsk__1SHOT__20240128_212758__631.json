The function uses a state machine to keep track of whether it's in a question or answer section, and it populates two separate arrays for questions and answers. Finally, it joins these arrays back into strings and returns them as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,258],"elapsed":8.395432735,"_type":"aimessage"}]
