It maintains two arrays, one for questions and one for answers, and ensures that each array entry starts with a blank line to denote the beginning of a new section. The returned tuple contains the concatenated questions and answers with leading spaces stripped.","status":200,"tokens":[0,301],"elapsed":9.800911057,"_type":"aimessage"}]
