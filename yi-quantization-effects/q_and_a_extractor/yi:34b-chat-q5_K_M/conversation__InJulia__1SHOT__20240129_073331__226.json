Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can write a function to extract questions and answers from a markdown-formatted text by looking for sections starting with \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\". Here's how you can implement such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    questions = String[]\n    answers = String[]\n    current_question = \"\"\n    current_answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if occursin(\"# Question\", line)\n            in_question = true\n            current_question = strip(line, '\\n')\n            current_answer = \"\"\n        elseif occursin(\"# Answer\", line)\n            in_answer = true\n            current_answer = strip(line, '\\n')\n            questions *= current_question\n            answers *= current_answer\n            current_question = \"\"\n            current_answer = \"\"\n        elseif in_question && !occursin(\"#\", line)\n            current_question *= strip(line) * \"\\n\"\n        elseif in_answer && !occursin(\"#\", line)\n            current_answer *= strip(line) * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return questions, answers\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses `eachline` to iterate over each line of the markdown text. It maintains two states: `in_question` and `in_answer`. When it encounters a line starting with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it sets the corresponding state to true and initializes the current question/answer string. As it processes subsequent lines, it appends the content of each line to the current question or answer string, stripping leading spaces and newlines.\n\nAfter iterating over all the lines, the function returns a tuple with both questions and answers.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Sample Markdown Text\n\n## Questions\n\n# Question 1\nWhat is the meaning of life?\n\n# Answer 1\nThe meaning of life, as far as I can tell, is to ask questions and seek answers.\n\n## More Questions\n\n# Question 2\nWhy did the bicycle fall over?\n\n# Answer 2\nBecause it was two-tired!\n\"\"\"\n\nquestions, answers = q_and_a_extractor(md)\n```\n\nThis would result in `questions` containing: \"What is the meaning of life?\" and `answers` containing: \"The meaning of life, as far as I can tell, is to ask questions and seek answers. Because it was two-tired!\"","status":200,"tokens":[104,621],"elapsed":26.685150162,"_type":"aimessage"}]
