[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = findall(\"^# Question\\s+\", md) .|> replace => s -> startswith(s, \"# \") ? strip(s, whitespace) : nothing\n    answers = findall(\"^# Answer\\s+\", md) .|> replace => s -> startswith(s, \"# \") ? strip(s, whitespace) : nothing\n    return questions[1:end-1], answers[1:end-1] # Assuming there's at least one of each section\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses `findall` to find all lines that start with `# Question` or `# Answer`. It then strips any leading whitespace and newlines using `strip(s, whitespace)`. The resulting texts are returned as a tuple of two arrays, one for the questions and one for the answers. The indices in the tuple correspond to the order of the questions and answers in the markdown text.\n\nIf there is more than one question or answer section, this function will extract all of them. If there's only one of each, it will return a tuple with exactly two elements. If there's no `# Question` or `# Answer` section, the corresponding element in the tuple will be `nothing`.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is at least one instance of both `# Question` and `# Answer` sections in the markdown text. If not, the returned tuples may contain fewer elements than expected or even `nothing` if no such sections are found.","status":200,"tokens":[0,362],"elapsed":11.977135893,"_type":"aimessage"}]
