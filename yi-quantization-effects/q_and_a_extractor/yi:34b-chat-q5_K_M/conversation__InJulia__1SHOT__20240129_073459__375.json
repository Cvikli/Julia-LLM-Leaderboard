The first array contains the stripped questions, and the second array contains the stripped answers. Note that this function assumes there is only one question-answer pair per section. If you have multiple pairs, you would need to modify the function to handle that case.","status":200,"tokens":[0,391],"elapsed":12.744619843,"_type":"aimessage"}]
