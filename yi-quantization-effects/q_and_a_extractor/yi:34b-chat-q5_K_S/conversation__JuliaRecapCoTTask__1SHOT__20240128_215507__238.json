[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

It then iterates over both regexes to replace matches with the captured group 1 (the text between `# Question`/`# Answer` and the first newline or end of string). After that, it removes leading whitespace from each line in the markdown text using another regular expression.\n\nFinally, it goes through the list of questions and answers pairs again, filtering out any pairs where the question regex does not occur in the processed markdown text, ensuring only valid questions and answers are returned. For each remaining pair, it strips leading whitespace from both the question and the answer to remove any additional newlines or spaces that might have been introduced during the replacement process.\n\nThe function returns a tuple of `(question, answer)` for each valid Q&A section in the markdown text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,446],"elapsed":14.421390159,"_type":"aimessage"}]
