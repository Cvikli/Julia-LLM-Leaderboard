Here's how you could implement the `q_and_a_extractor` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    ast = Markdown.parse(md)\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n\n    # Traverse the AST and extract questions and answers\n    for (i, node) in enumerate(ast)\n        if isa(node, Markdown.Paragraph) && occursin(\"# Question\", node.text)\n            start_index = i + 1  # Start from the next sibling because we're on a paragraph\n            question = \"\"\n            while (i < length(ast)) && !(isa(ast[i], Markdown.Paragraph) && occursin(\"# Answer\", ast[i].text))\n                if isa(ast[i], Markdown.Text)\n                    question *= strip(ast[i].text)  # Remove leading spaces and newlines\n                end\n                i += 1\n            end\n            push!(questions, question)\n        elseif isa(node, Markdown.Paragraph) && occursin(\"# Answer\", node.text)\n            answer = \"\"\n            while (i < length(ast)) && !(isa(ast[i], Markdown.Paragraph) && occursin(\"# Question\", ast[i].text))\n                if isa(ast[i], Markdown.Text)\n                    answer *= strip(ast[i].text)  # Remove leading spaces and newlines\n                end\n                i += 1\n            end\n            push!(answers, answer)\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return a tuple of questions and answers\n    return (questions, answers)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Q&A Session\n\n## Question 1\nWhy was six afraid of seven?\n\n### Answer\nBecause seven eight (ate) nine!\n\n## Question 2\nWhat's the capital of Texas?\n\n### Answer\nThe capital of Texas is Austin.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestions, answers = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\nprintln(\"Questions: \", questions)\nprintln(\"Answers: \", answers)\n```\n\nThis function will extract all questions and their corresponding answers from the provided Markdown text `md`. It strips leading spaces and newlines from each answer using `strip` before appending it to the list of answers. Finally, it returns a tuple containing two lists, one for questions and another for answers.","status":200,"tokens":[0,664],"elapsed":21.263926742,"_type":"aimessage"}]
