It then extracts the text between each pair of headers, stripping leading spaces and newlines. The function also ensures that there is a matching answer for each question and that none of the extracted texts are empty.\n\nTo use this function with the provided data:\n\n```julia\njulia> q_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\n       What is the capital of France?\n\n       # Answer\n       The capital of France is Paris.\n       \")\n(\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\nPlease note that this function assumes there are no nested headers and that each question is directly followed by an answer without any other content in between. If these assumptions do not hold, additional logic would be required to handle more complex markdown structures.","status":200,"tokens":[244,689],"elapsed":38.460319653,"_type":"aimessage"}]
