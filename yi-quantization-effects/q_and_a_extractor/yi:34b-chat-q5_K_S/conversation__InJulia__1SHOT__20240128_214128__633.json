If so, it updates an internal array to track the sections. For each line that doesn't start a new section, it appends the content to the appropriate part (question or answer) of the current tuple in the output array.\n\nThe function returns two arrays: one with the questions and another with the answers. The questions are empty strings for the first element if there is no question before an answer, and vice versa. This is because the first element in the output array is used to initialize the parsing process.","status":200,"tokens":[0,496],"elapsed":15.824056413,"_type":"aimessage"}]
