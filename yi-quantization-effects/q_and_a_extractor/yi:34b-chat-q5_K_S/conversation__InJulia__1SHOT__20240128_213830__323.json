Here's an example of how you might implement the `q_and_a_extractor` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    questions = r\"^#\\s*Question\\s*$\"m\n    answers = r\"^#\\s*Answer\\s*$\"m\n    \n    questions_matches = findall(questions, md)\n    answers_matches = findall(answers, md)\n    \n    question_indices = [start(x) for x in questions_matches]\n    answer_indices = [start(x) for x in answers_matches]\n    \n    # Check if there are equal number of questions and answers\n    if length(questions_matches) != length(answers_matches)\n        throw(ErrorException(\"Unmatched question and answer sections.\"))\n    end\n    \n    questions = String[]\n    answers = String[]\n    \n    for (i, qa_pair) in enumerate(zip(question_indices, answer_indices))\n        # Get the text between the questions and answers\n        text = strip(md[qa_pair[1] + 1:qa_pair[2]])\n        \n        # Add to respective arrays\n        push!(questions, text)\n        push!(answers, text)\n    end\n    \n    return (questions[1] => answers[1])\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Markdown document example\n\n## Question 1\nSome question here.\n\n## Answer 1\nSome answer here.\n\n# Another section\n\n## Question 2\nAnother question.\n\n## Answer 2\nAnother answer.\n\"\"\"\n\nq_and_a = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: \", q_and_a[1])\nprintln(\"Answer: \", q_and_a[2])\n```\n\nThis function uses `findall` to find all matches for the patterns `# Question` and `# Answer`. It then iterates over these matches to extract the text between each question and answer pair. The leading spaces and newlines are stripped using `strip` before adding the text to the corresponding arrays.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes there is exactly one question-answer pair per section, starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively. If you have a more complex markdown structure or need to handle different formats, you would need to adapt the regular expressions and extraction logic accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[104,602],"elapsed":26.243726975,"_type":"aimessage"}]
