[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

It can be as simple as being happy and helping those around you or as complex as striving for personal growth and leaving a lasting impact on the world.\n\n## Question 2\nWhy is the sky blue?\n\n## Answer 2\nThe sky appears blue due to Rayleigh scattering, which is when light from the sun is scattered more intensely by the shorter wavelength blue light than by red light as it passes through Earth's atmosphere. This is why we see a predominance of blue in the daytime sky.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Call the q_and_a_extractor function\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md)\n\n# Test the result\n@test length(result) == 2\n@test isa(result[1], String)\n@test isa(result[2], String)\n```\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no nested `# Question` or `# Answer` sections within a question or answer. If such nesting occurs, the function may not extract the text correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,888],"elapsed":28.834613397,"_type":"aimessage"}]
