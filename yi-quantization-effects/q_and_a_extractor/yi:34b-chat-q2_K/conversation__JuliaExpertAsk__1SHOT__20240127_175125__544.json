It uses two capture groups in the regular expressions to find the sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively. Then, it strips leading whitespace and newlines from both captures using [`strip()`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/#Base.strip) function. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer texts.","status":200,"tokens":[0,260],"elapsed":6.667620909,"_type":"aimessage"}]
