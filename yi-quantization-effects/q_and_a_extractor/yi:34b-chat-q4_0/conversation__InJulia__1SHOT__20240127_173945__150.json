It assumes that there is only one question and answer pair per document. If there are multiple pairs, the function will only extract the last one it encounters.\n\nPlease note that this code has not been tested with a real Julia environment, but it should give you an idea of how to approach the problem.","status":200,"tokens":[0,574],"elapsed":15.25914188,"_type":"aimessage"}]
