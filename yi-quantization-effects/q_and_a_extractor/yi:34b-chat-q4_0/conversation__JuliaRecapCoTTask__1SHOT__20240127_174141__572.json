[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = Vector{String}()\n    answers = Vector{String}()\n    lines = split(strip(md), \"\\n\")\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    for (i, line) in enumerate(lines)\n        if line == \"# Question\" && !in_answer\n            in_question = true\n        elseif line == \"# Answer\" && in_question\n            answers = [strip(line2) for line2 in lines[i+1:end] if is_not_empty(line2)]\n            break\n        end\n    end\n    for (i, line) in enumerate(lines)\n        if line == \"# Question\" && !in_answer\n            questions = [strip(line2) for line2 in lines[1:i] if is_not_empty(line2)]\n            in_question = true\n        end\n    end\n    return (first(questions), first(answers))\nend\n\nfunction is_not_empty(s::String)\n    return !isempty(s) && s[1] != '-'\nend\n```\n\nPlease note that the `Markdown` package is used to parse the markdown text. The function `q_and_a_extractor` assumes that the input `md` is a string containing valid markdown syntax, and it only looks for sections starting with \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\" as specified in the special instructions. If other types of headings are present, they will be ignored by this function.\n\nThe `is_not_empty` function is used to filter out empty strings or strings that start with a dash, which might occur if the markdown text includes lists.","status":200,"tokens":[0,412],"elapsed":11.076073897,"_type":"aimessage"}]
