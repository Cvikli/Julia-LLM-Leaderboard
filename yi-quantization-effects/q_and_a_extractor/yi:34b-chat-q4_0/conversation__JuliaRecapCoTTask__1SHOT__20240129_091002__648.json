X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Given the task and special instructions you provided, I'll follow the systematic approach to solve this problem:\n\n1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n   - Regular expressions for pattern matching.\n   - String manipulation functions like `strip`.\n   - Functions for working with Markdown in the `Markdown` standard library (if available).\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)::Tuple{String,String}\n    # Find all sections starting with \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\"\n    # Extract the text between these headers and strip leading spaces/newlines\n    # Return a tuple of question and answer strings\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n   - Ensure that the function correctly handles different formats of questions and answers within the markdown text.\n   - Test the function with different input markdown texts to validate its robustness.\n\nBelow is a possible implementation of the `q_and_a_extractor` function, assuming the availability of a Markdown standard library in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)::Tuple{String,String}\n    # Initialize an empty tuple to return\n    result = Tuple{}()\n\n    # Parse the markdown text into a document\n    doc = parse(Markdown.MD, md)\n\n    # Iterate over all headers in the document looking for \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\"\n    for h in findall(doc, r\"^#\\s+Question\")\n        # Find the next header after this one that starts with \"# Answer\"\n        a_h = findnext(r\"^#\\s+Answer\", doc.lines[h] + '\\n', h + 1)\n        if a_h !== nothing\n            # Extract the text between the headers, strip leading spaces and newlines\n            answer = strip(join(doc.lines[h+1:a_h-1]))\n            \n            # Now find the question header\n            q_h = findprev(r\"^#\\s+Question\", doc.lines[a_h] + '\\n', h)\n            if q_h !== nothing\n                question = strip(join(doc.lines[q_h+1:h-1]))\n                result = (question, answer)\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return the result tuple\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nPlease note that the above function assumes a basic structure of questions and answers in the markdown text, where each `# Question` is followed by exactly one `# Answer`. If there are nested headers or multiple questions without answers (or vice versa), additional logic would be required to handle those cases.\n\nAlso, since this task involves parsing markdown syntax, it's worth mentioning that the behavior of the `Markdown` standard library may have a significant impact on how this function works. If the library does not provide the necessary functions or APIs to extract the text in the desired way, additional manual parsing might be needed.\n\nTo test this function, you can create various markdown texts with different structures and check if the returned tuple contains the correct question and answer text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,741],"elapsed":20.450948232,"_type":"aimessage"}]
