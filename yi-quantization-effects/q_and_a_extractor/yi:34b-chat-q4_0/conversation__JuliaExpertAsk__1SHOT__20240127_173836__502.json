When it encounters a `# Question` line, it starts collecting the question text. Similarly, when it sees a `# Answer` line, it starts collecting the answer text. Both questions and answers are stored as lists until the end of the document is reached. Finally, the first element from each list is returned as the tuple `(question, answer)`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,345],"elapsed":9.130296937,"_type":"aimessage"}]
