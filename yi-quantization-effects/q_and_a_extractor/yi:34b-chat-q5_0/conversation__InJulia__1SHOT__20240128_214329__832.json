It does this by splitting the text into lines, looking for lines that start with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", and then extracting the text between these headers. The leading spaces and newlines are stripped from the extracted text before it's returned in the tuple.\n\nTo use this function, you would call it like so:\n\n```julia\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Markdown Example\n\n## Question 1\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n## Answer 1\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\n## Question 2\nWho was the first President of the United States?\n\n## Answer 2\nThe first President of the United States was George Washington.\n\"\"\"\n\nq_and_a = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\nprintln(\"Questions and Answers:\")\nfor (question, answer) in q_and_a\n    println(\"  Question: $question\")\n    println(\"  Answer:   $answer\")\nend\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nQuestions and Answers:\n  Question: What is the capital of France?\n  Answer:   The capital of France is Paris.\n  Question: Who was the first President of the United States?\n  Answer:   The first President of the United States was George Washington.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,829],"elapsed":26.610328601,"_type":"aimessage"}]
