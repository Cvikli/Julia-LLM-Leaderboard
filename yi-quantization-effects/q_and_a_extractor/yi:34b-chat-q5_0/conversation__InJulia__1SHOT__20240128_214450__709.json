Here's an example of how you might implement such a function:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    questions = Regex(\"^# Question[[:space:]](.+)$\", \"m\")\n    answers = Regex(\"^# Answer[[:space:]](.+)$\", \"m\")\n    sections = parse(Markdown.MD, md)::Vector{Any}\n\n    questions_found = false\n    answers_found = false\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    for section in sections\n        if questions_found && answers_found\n            break\n        end\n\n        if questions_found\n            question = strip(section.text)\n            questions_found = false\n        elseif answers_found\n            answer = strip(section.text)\n            answers_found = false\n        end\n\n        if match(questions, section.text) !== nothing\n            questions_found = true\n        end\n        if match(answers, section.text) !== nothing\n            answers_found = true\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Markdown QA Extractor Example\n\n# Question\nHow can I extract questions and answers from a markdown document?\n\n# Answer\nYou can use regular expressions to find sections starting with 'Question' and 'Answer', and then parse the text following these headers. Here's an example in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    # ... your function code here ...\nend\n```\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\nprintln(\"Question: $question\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $answer\")\n```\n\nThis script defines a `q_and_a_extractor` function that uses the `Markdown.parse` function to convert the markdown text into a vector of sections. It then loops through these sections, looking for blocks starting with \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\". When it finds such a block, it strips leading whitespace and newlines from the section's text and stores the question and answer accordingly. The function returns a tuple containing the question and answer strings.\n\nThe `strip` function is used to remove leading and trailing whitespace (including newlines) from the extracted text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,587],"elapsed":18.758951288,"_type":"aimessage"}]
