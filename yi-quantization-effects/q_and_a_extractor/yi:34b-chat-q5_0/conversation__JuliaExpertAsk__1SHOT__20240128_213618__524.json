It uses regular expressions to match the \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\" headers in markdown, then extracts the text following these headers by using `eachmatch` and `m.match` to capture the entire line including the header. Finally, it strips any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text before returning a tuple of questions and answers.","status":200,"tokens":[143,448],"elapsed":20.503091824,"_type":"aimessage"}]
