[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

The function first converts the markdown to HTML for easier parsing using the `Markdown.parse` function, then finds all `<h1>` tags with ids \"question\" and \"answer\", ensuring there is exactly one pair. It extracts the text from each question and answer by finding the next sibling element that is not a closing tag (`</div>`) and strips leading spaces and newlines. The code also includes two helper functions, `next_sibling`, to find the next sibling element in the HTML, and an example usage with a simple markdown string. Finally, it calls `main()` to run the example.","status":200,"tokens":[0,1091],"elapsed":35.442385411,"_type":"aimessage"}]
