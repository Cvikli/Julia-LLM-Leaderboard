[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if occursin(\"# Question\", line)\n            start_question = true\n        elseif occursin(\"# Answer\", line)\n            start_answer = true\n            if start_question && start_answer\n                push!(questions, strip(take!(lines, end=1)))\n                push!(answers, strip(takewhile(line -> !occursin(\"# Question\", line), lines)))\n                start_question = false\n                start_answer = false\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return (questions[1], answers[1])\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses `eachline` to iterate over the lines of the markdown text. It checks for the start of a question and answer section by looking for lines that contain \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\", respectively. Once it finds such a line, it prepares to store the corresponding content. If both types of sections are encountered in sequence, the function captures the text between them (excluding the headers) and adds it to the respective lists. After all lines have been processed, it returns the first question and answer as a tuple.\n\nThe `strip` function is used to remove leading whitespace and newlines from each line before storing it. The `take!` function is used to ensure we don't include the \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\" headers in the extracted text. The `takewhile` function allows us to consume lines until a certain condition is met (in this case, until a line with \"# Question\" is found).\n\nThis solution assumes that there will be at least one question and answer section in the markdown text. If there are none, the function will return an empty tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,416],"elapsed":13.455831512,"_type":"aimessage"}]
