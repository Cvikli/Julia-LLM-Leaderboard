It pushes each line into separate arrays for questions and answers. After processing all the lines, it returns a tuple with two pairs: one containing the first question and its corresponding answer, and another pair containing the rest of the questions and their corresponding answers. The `strip` function is used to remove leading whitespace and newlines from each line before pushing it into the arrays.","status":200,"tokens":[0,408],"elapsed":12.966323178,"_type":"aimessage"}]
