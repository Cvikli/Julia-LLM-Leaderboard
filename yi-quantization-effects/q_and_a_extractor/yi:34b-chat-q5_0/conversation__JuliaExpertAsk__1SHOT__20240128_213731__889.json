It maintains two arrays, `questions` and `answers`, which are appended to as it iterates over each line of the markdown text. After extracting all questions and answers, it returns them as a tuple with the questions and answers joined by newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,469],"elapsed":14.967099895,"_type":"aimessage"}]
