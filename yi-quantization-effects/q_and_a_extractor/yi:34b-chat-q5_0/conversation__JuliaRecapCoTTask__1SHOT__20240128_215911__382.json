[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Given the task and special instructions provided:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Step 1: Preprocess the markdown string\n    # Remove leading whitespace and newlines from each line\n    preprocessed_md = replace(md, r\"^\\s+|\\n\" => \"\")\n\n    # Step 2: Find all sections starting with \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\"\n    question_answers = findall(r\"^# Question\\n([^\\n]+?)\\n# Answer\\n([^\\n]+?)\\n\", preprocessed_md)\n\n    # Step 3: Extract the question and answer from each section\n    questions_and_answers = [(QuestionAnswer(q, a) for (q, a) in zip(split(question, \"\\n\")[1:end-1], split(answer, \"\\n\")[2:end])]\n\n    # Step 4: Return the extracted questions and answers as a tuple of strings\n    return questions_answers\nend\n```\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. Preprocesses the markdown string by removing leading whitespace and newlines from each line using `replace` with a regular expression.\n2. Uses `findall` to find all sections that start with \"# Question\" followed by a non-newline character, zero or more spaces, followed by any number of characters until \"# Answer\" is encountered, also allowing for zero or more spaces before the newline after \"# Answer\".\n3. For each matching section, it extracts the question and answer parts using `split` to get a vector of lines without the leading whitespace and newlines, then selects the appropriate elements from this vector (excluding the empty line between the questions and answers).\n4. Creates a tuple of strings with the question and answer for each extracted section.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the markdown text is well-formed and that each `# Question` section is followed by exactly one `# Answer` section without any other headings or content in between. If this assumption does not hold, additional logic would be needed to handle more complex scenarios.","status":200,"tokens":[0,484],"elapsed":15.662110376,"_type":"aimessage"}]
