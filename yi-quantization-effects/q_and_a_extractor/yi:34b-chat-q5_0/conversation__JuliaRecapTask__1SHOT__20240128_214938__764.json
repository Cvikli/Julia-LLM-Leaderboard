[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    questions = findall(\"^# Question\\s+?\\n\", md) .+ 1\n    answers = findall(\"^# Answer\\s+?\\n\", md) .+ 1\n    \n    results = [(q, a) for q in questions, a in answers if q <= a]\n    \n    for (i, r) in enumerate(results)\n        if i > 0\n            # Strip leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text\n            r[1] = strip(md[r[1] - 1:prevind(md, r[2]) - 1])\n            r[2] = strip(md[r[2]:nextind(md, r[2])])\n        end\n    end\n    return results\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by finding all occurrences of `# Question` and `# Answer` in the markdown text. It then constructs a list of tuples where each tuple contains the start indices of a question and its corresponding answer. Finally, it iterates over these tuples, strips leading whitespace and newlines from the extracted text, and returns the cleaned-up results.","status":200,"tokens":[415,282],"elapsed":15.364105606,"_type":"aimessage"}]
