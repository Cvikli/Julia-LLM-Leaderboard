It then iterates over each line in the text, keeping track of the index where a `# Question` is found and waiting for an `# Answer` to extract the question and answer pairs. The result is returned as a tuple containing all the extracted questions and answers.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes the markdown formatting is consistent with each question starting a new section with `# Question` followed by at least one empty line, and each answer starting with `# Answer` followed by an empty line or more content.","status":200,"tokens":[0,423],"elapsed":11.690771782,"_type":"aimessage"}]
