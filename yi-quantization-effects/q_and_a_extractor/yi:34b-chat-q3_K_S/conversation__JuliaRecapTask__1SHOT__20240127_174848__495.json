[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = findall(\"# Question\", md) .+ 1\n    answers = findall(\"# Answer\", md) .+ 2\n    qa_pairs = []\n    for i in eachindex(questions):\n        if answers[i] > questions[i] {\n            question = strip(md[questions[i]:answers[i]-1])\n            answer = strip(md[answers[i]:answers[i]-2])\n            push!(qa_pairs, (question, answer))\n        }\n    end\n    return qa_pairs\nend\n```\n\nThis function finds all occurrences of `# Question` and `# Answer` in the markdown text (`md`) using `findall()`. It then constructs a tuple containing the question and answer for each pair. The text between `# Question` and `# Answer` is stripped of leading spaces and newlines using `strip()`.\n\nTo use this function, you would call it with your markdown text as an argument:\n\n```julia\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Markdown Document Title\n## Heading Level 2\n# Question\nThis is a question in the middle of the document.\n# Answer\nThis is the corresponding answer.\n## Another Heading Level 2\n# Question\nWhat does Julia do?\n# Answer\nJulia is a high-level, high-performance, dynamic programming language developed for technical computing. It was designed to be fast, dynamic, and easy to use.\n\"\"\"\nqa_pairs = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\n```\n\nThe `qa_pairs` variable will contain a vector of tuples where each tuple has the question text followed by the answer text from the markdown document.","status":200,"tokens":[412,410],"elapsed":11.327374674,"_type":"aimessage"}]
