Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might define your `q_and_a_extractor` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question = strip(readuntil(line, '\\n'), [' ', '\\n'])\n            in_answer = true\n        end\n        if startswith(line, \"# Answer\") || in_answer == false\n            answer *= strip(line)\n            answer *= \"\\n\"\n            in_answer = false\n        end\n    end\n    return question, answer\nend\n```\n\nThis function assumes that your markdown text `md` is a string containing the entire content. It searches for lines starting with `# Question` and `# Answer` using `startswith` and then strips any leading whitespace or newlines using `strip`. The `readuntil` function reads from its input up to the first occurrence of a specified delimiter and returns the text between the start of the line and the delimiter.\n\nTo use this function, simply pass your markdown string `md` to it:\n\n```julia\nmd_text = \"\"\"# Markdown example\n## Question\nWhat is the best way to extract Q&A from a markdown file?\n\n### Answer\nUsing an AI assistant like me!","status":200,"tokens":[0,343],"elapsed":9.089502029,"_type":"aimessage"}]
