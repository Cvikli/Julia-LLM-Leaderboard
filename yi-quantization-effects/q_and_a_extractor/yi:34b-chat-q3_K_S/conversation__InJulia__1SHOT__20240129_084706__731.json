It captures the text that follows these headers and then strips any leading spaces or newlines from the extracted text using the `strip(str, whitespace=true)` method. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the questions and answers.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is at least one `# Question` and `# Answer` section in the markdown text provided. If you have any additional requirements or need to handle more complex markdown formats, please provide more information so I can update the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[104,401],"elapsed":15.331239512,"_type":"aimessage"}]
