Here's an example of such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Regular expression for question section header\n    question_header = raw\"(?ms)^\\s*##\\s*Question\\s*$\"\n    # Regular expression for answer section header\n    answer_header = raw\"(?ms)^\\s*##\\s*Answer\\s*$\"\n    # Regular expression for extracting text between headers\n    text_extractor = raw\"(?ms)(?<=^(?:${question_header}|${answer_header}))[^\\n]*(?=\\n^(?:${question_header}|${answer_header}|\\Z))\"\n\n    # Match on the text to find questions and answers\n    matches = match.((text_extractor, md), (question_header, answer_header))\n\n    questions = String[]\n    answers = String[]\n\n    for m in matches\n        if occursin(question_header, m.captures[1])\n            # If it's a question header, add the text to questions array\n            push!(questions, strip(m.captures[2]))\n        elseif occursin(answer_header, m.captures[1])\n            # If it's an answer header, add the text to answers array\n            push!(answers, strip(m.captures[2]))\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (questions = questions, answers = answers)\nend\n```\n\nThis function defines regular expressions for both question and answer headers (`## Question` and `## Answer`, respectively) and then uses a capture group to extract the text between them. It returns a tuple with arrays of questions and answers.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes a specific formatting where each question and answer is preceded by its respective header (`## Question` and `## Answer`). If there are other headers or markdown elements before or after each question and answer, the regular expressions may need to be adjusted accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,475],"elapsed":12.634946182,"_type":"aimessage"}]
