[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = Dict{String, String}()\n    answers = Dict{String, String}()\n    current_section = :none\n    sections = [Regex(@sprintf \"^ *\\\\#{1,} *Question +([^#\\n]+)\")]\n    for (i, line) in enumerate(eachline(md))\n        # Create a regex for each line and use match to check if it matches any of the patterns\n        matched = false\n        for pattern in sections\n            if m = match(pattern, line) !== nothing\n                # Store the question or answer based on the section title\n                if pattern.source == sections[1].source\n                    questions[m.captures[1]] = \"\"\n                elseif pattern.source == sections[2].source\n                    answers[m.captures[1]] = \"\"\n                end\n                matched = true\n            end\n        end\n        # If the line doesn't match any section title, append to current content\n        if !matched && i > 0\n            if current_section == :question\n                questions[current_section] = questions[:question] * \"\\n\" * (line * \"\\n\")\n            elseif current_section == :answer\n                answers[current_section] = answers[:answer] * \"\\n\" * (line * \"\\n\")\n            end\n        end\n        # Switch sections based on the title found\n        if line === \"# Question\"\n            current_section = :question\n        elseif line === \"# Answer\"\n            current_section = :answer\n        end\n    end\n    return questions, answers\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each line of the markdown text and maintaining a state variable `current_section` to track whether it's in the Question or Answer section. It uses regular expressions to match the titles (`# Question` and `# Answer`) and captures any content following them. The captured content is then appended to the corresponding dictionary keyed by the question or answer title.\n\nTo use this function, you would call it with your markdown text as follows:\n\n```julia\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Question 1\n## Subquestion 1.1\nSome context here.\n\n# Answer 1\nThis is the answer to question 1 and subquestion 1.1.\n\n# Question 2\nAnother question followed by an answer.\n# Answer 2\nThe answer for this question.\n\"\"\"\n\nq_and_a_extractor(md_text) # Returns a tuple of questions and answers dictionaries\n```\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the markdown text is well-formed with each `# Question` and `# Answer` followed by one or more blank lines to separate them from the next section.","status":200,"tokens":[415,652],"elapsed":22.766817833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
