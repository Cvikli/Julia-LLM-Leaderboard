[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

It uses `split(md, '\\n')` to convert the text into a vector of lines, then iterates over the lines to find sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`. For each question and answer pair, it strips leading whitespace and newlines from the extracted text using `strip()` and concatenates the lines with `join(lines(md)[start_index:i-1], \"\\n\")`.\n\nThe resulting tuples are returned in a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains a question and its corresponding answer. If there is only one pair, the function will return a tuple with one element. If there are no questions or answers found, the function will return an empty tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,544],"elapsed":24.745820653,"_type":"aimessage"}]
