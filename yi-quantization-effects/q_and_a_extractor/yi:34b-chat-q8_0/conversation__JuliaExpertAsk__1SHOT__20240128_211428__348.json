It also defines a utility function `nextline` that advances to the next line in the string by returning the substring starting from the end of the current line to the end of the input string or the next newline character, whichever comes first. The `q_and_a_extractor` function loops over each line of the markdown text and maintains a state variable `current_section` to track whether it's in the question or answer section. It appends lines to the respective arrays until it encounters the end of the section.","status":200,"tokens":[0,398],"elapsed":17.970662411,"_type":"aimessage"}]
