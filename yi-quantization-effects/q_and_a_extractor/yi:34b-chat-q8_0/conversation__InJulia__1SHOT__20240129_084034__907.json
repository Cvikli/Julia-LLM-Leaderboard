It then strips leading spaces and newlines from the text and yields tuples of `(question, answer)` for each question-answer pair it finds.\n\nTo use this function, you would call it like so:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question 1\nThis is a question\n\n# Answer 1\nHere's the answer\n\n# Question 2\nAnother question\n\n# Answer 2\nAnd here's the answer to that one\n\"\"\"\n\nquestions_and_answers = q_and_a_extractor(md) |> collect\n```\n\nThe `collect` at the end of the pipeline converts the generator into a vector, which you can then iterate over or use however you like. The resulting `questions_and_answers` will be a Vector of Tuples containing the questions and answers.","status":200,"tokens":[0,529],"elapsed":23.850159288,"_type":"aimessage"}]
