Here's how you could implement `q_and_a_extractor`:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regular expressions to match the start of a question or answer section\n    question_re = r\"^# Question\\n(.*)$\"m\n    answer_re = r\"^# Answer\\n(.*)$\"m\n\n    # Initialize an empty array to store the questions and answers\n    questions_and_answers = Vector{Tuple{String, String}}()\n\n    # Iterate over each line in the markdown text\n    for (line_number, line) in enumerate(eachline(md))\n        # If a line matches the question pattern, add it to the array with an empty answer\n        m = match(question_re, line)\n        if m !== nothing\n            push!(questions_and_answers, (strip(m[1]), \"\"))\n        end\n\n        # If a line matches the answer pattern and there's a question before it, extract the answer\n        elseif m = match(answer_re, line) !== nothing && length(questions_and_answers) > 0\n            last_question = questions_and_answers[end]\n            last_question[2] = strip(m[1])\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return the questions and answers as a tuple\n    return (questions_and_answers...,)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Markdown Text\n\n# Question\nWhat is the answer to life, universe, and everything?\n\n# Answer\n42\n\"\"\"\n\nq_and_a = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\nprintln(\"Question: $(q_and_a[1][1])\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $(q_and_a[1][2])\")\n```\n\nThis function will extract the first question and answer pair from the provided markdown text. If you have multiple questions and answers, it will extract all of them in a tuple. Note that this example assumes there is only one level of headers (`#`) used for both questions and answers. If you have more complex Markdown with nested headers or different styles of formatting, you would need to adjust the regular expressions accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[104,574],"elapsed":35.130350919,"_type":"aimessage"}]
