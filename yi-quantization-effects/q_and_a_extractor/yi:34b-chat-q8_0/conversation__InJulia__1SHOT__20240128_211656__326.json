The function `q_and_a_extractor` takes a markdown text `md` as input.\n2. It uses the built-in `eachline` iterator to go through each line of the text.\n3. For each line, the function checks if it starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\" using `startswith`.\n4. If a line starts with \"# Question\", the `question_open` variable is set to true, indicating that we are now in the question section.\n5. Similarly, if a line starts with \"# Answer\", the `answer_open` variable is set to true, indicating that we are now in the answer section.\n6. If `question_open` is true and `answer_open` is false, the function strips leading whitespace and newlines from the current line using `strip(line)` and appends it to the `questions` array.\n7. If `answer_open` is true, the same process is done for the `answers` array.\n8. Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the joined strings of the questions and answers.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Markdown Example\n\n# Question\nWhat is 2 + 2?\n\n# Answer\n4\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: $question\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $answer\")\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```plaintext\nQuestion: What is 2 + 2?\nAnswer: 4\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,570],"elapsed":25.699194069,"_type":"aimessage"}]
