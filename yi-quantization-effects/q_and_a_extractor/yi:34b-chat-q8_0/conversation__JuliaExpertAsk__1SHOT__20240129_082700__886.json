For each subsequent question-answer pair, it appends the question to a vector of questions and the answer to a vector of answers. The `strip` function is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from both the question and the answer.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes there is exactly one space after the \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\" headers, which is a common convention in markdown. If your input markdown does not follow this convention, you may need to adjust the regular expressions accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,498],"elapsed":22.45231313,"_type":"aimessage"}]
