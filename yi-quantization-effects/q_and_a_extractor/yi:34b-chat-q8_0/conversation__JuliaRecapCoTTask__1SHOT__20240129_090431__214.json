[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

It maintains two separate lists for questions and answers, appending each line to the appropriate list while stripping leading whitespace and newlines. After parsing the entire text, it combines the questions and their corresponding answers into tuples and returns a tuple of all extracted question-answer pairs.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the markdown text is well-formed, meaning that each `# Question` header is followed by at least one line of text (which becomes the question) before a `# Answer` header or the end of the document, and vice versa for answers. If questions and answers are not properly separated by newlines, the function may not work as expected.\n\nTo use this function, simply call it with your markdown-formatted text:\n\n```julia\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Question\nSome question here...\n\n# Answer\nThe answer is...\n\"\"\"\n\nquestions_and_answers = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\nprintln(\"Questions and Answers: $questions_and_answers\")\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```plaintext\nQuestions and Answers: [(\"Some question here...\", \"The answer is...\")]\n```\n\nIf there are multiple questions and answers in the text, the function will return a tuple with all of them.","status":200,"tokens":[417,749],"elapsed":43.567310722,"_type":"aimessage"}]
