Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can define a function to extract questions and answers from a markdown-formatted text by looking for headers starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`. Here's how you could write such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = Vector{String}()\n    answers = Vector{String}()\n    current_section = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    # Iterate over each line in the markdown text\n    for line in split(md, '\\n')\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            if in_answer\n                answers[end] = answers[end] * \"\\n\" * strip(current_section)\n            end\n            in_question = true\n            current_section = line\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            if in_question\n                questions += [strip(current_section)]\n                in_answer = true\n                current_section = line\n            end\n        else\n            if in_question\n                current_section *= strip(line) * \"\\n\"\n            elseif in_answer\n                current_section *= strip(line) * \"\\n\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Handle the last question and answer\n    if in_question\n        questions += [strip(current_section)]\n    elseif in_answer\n        answers += [strip(current_section)]\n    end\n\n    return questions, answers\nend\n```\n\nThis function will return a tuple of two vectors: the first vector contains the questions, and the second vector contains the corresponding answers. It works by keeping track of the current section (either a question or an answer) and appending lines to it until the next header is found. The `strip` function is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from each line before concatenating them.\n\nTo use this function, you would simply call it with your markdown-formatted text:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Markdown Text\n\n## Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n## Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.","status":200,"tokens":[101,502],"elapsed":22.775633508,"_type":"aimessage"}]
