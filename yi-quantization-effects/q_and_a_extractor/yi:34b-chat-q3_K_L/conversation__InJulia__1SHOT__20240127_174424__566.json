Below is an example of how such a function might be implemented:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n    current_question = \"\"\n    current_answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in split(md, '\\n')\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            current_question = strip(line)\n        end\n        if in_question && !startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            current_question *= ' ' * line\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n            current_answer = strip(line)\n        end\n        if in_answer && !startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            current_answer *= ' ' * line\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Question\") || startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            # If we're at a new question or answer, add the current one to the list\n            if !in_question && !in_answer\n                pushfirst!(questions, current_question)\n                pushfirst!(answers, current_answer)\n            end\n            current_question = \"\"\n            current_answer = \"\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    # If there's a last question or answer, add it to the list\n    if !in_question && !in_answer\n        pushfirst!(questions, current_question)\n        pushfirst!(answers, current_answer)\n    end\n\n    return (questions = questions, answers = answers)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a state machine to keep track of whether it's in the question or answer section. It builds up the question and answer strings as it iterates over each line of the markdown text. After each `# Answer` or `# Question` line, it checks if there's any content to extract and adds it to the respective lists.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes a basic structure for questions and answers and might need further refinement depending on the actual formatting of the input text. It also assumes that there is no nesting of `# Question` and `# Answer` sections within each other.\n\nTo use the function, you would simply call it with your markdown-formatted text as an argument:\n\n```julia\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Introduction\n## Section 1\n# Question\nWhat is the purpose of this document?\n# Answer\nThe purpose of this document is to provide a framework for...\n## Section 2\n# Question\nHow do I implement this in practice?\n# Answer\nTo implement this in practice, you should follow these steps:\n1. ...\n\"\"\"\n\nq_and_a = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\n```\n\nThis will give you a tuple `q_and_a` with keys `questions` and `answers`, each containing an array of the extracted questions and answers, respectively.","status":200,"tokens":[0,757],"elapsed":21.0702547,"_type":"aimessage"}]
