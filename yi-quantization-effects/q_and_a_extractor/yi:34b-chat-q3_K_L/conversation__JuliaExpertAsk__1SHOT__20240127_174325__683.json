The function works by splitting the markdown into sections based on headings and then filtering to find the questions and answers sections. It ensures there is exactly one `# Question` and one `# Answer` section before extracting the text and stripping any leading whitespace.","status":200,"tokens":[0,307],"elapsed":8.469753031,"_type":"aimessage"}]
