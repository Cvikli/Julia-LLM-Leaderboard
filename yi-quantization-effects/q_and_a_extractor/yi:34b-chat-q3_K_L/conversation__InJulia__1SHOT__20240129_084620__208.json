Here's how you could implement `q_and_a_extractor` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regex patterns for question and answer sections\n    question_pattern = r\"^# Question\\n(\\s*.*\\S)\"m\n    answer_pattern = r\"^# Answer\\n(\\s*.*\\S)\"m\n\n    # Initialize an empty array to store the answers\n    answers = Vector{String}()\n\n    # Split the text into lines and iterate over them\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        # Check if a line matches the question pattern\n        m = match(question_pattern, line)\n        if m !== nothing\n            # If it's a new question, start saving the answer text\n            question = strip(m.captures[1])  # Strip leading spaces and newlines from the matched text\n            answer = \"\"\n        end\n\n        # Check if a line matches the answer pattern\n        m = match(answer_pattern, line)\n        if m !== nothing\n            # Append the line to the answer text\n            answer *= strip(m.captures[1])  # Strip leading spaces and newlines from the matched text\n        end\n\n        # If we reach the end of a question section (indicated by an empty line), add the answer to the result\n        if m == nothing && length(line) == 0\n            push!(answers, answer)  # Add the answer to the array\n            answer = \"\"  # Clear the answer buffer for next question\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return the answers as a tuple with questions and answers\n    return (question, answer) for question, answer in zip(questions, answers) if !isempty(question) && !isempty(answer)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Introduction\nThis is some introductory text.\n\n# Question\nWhat is the meaning of life?\n\n# Answer\nThe meaning of life is to find your own happiness and to contribute to the well-being of others.\n\n# Another question\nIs there a God?\n\n# Another answer\nThe existence of God is a matter of personal belief and varies from person to person.\n\n# Conclusion\nIn conclusion, we should all strive to live meaningful lives.\n\"\"\"\nquestions_and_answers = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(questions_and_answers)\n```\n\nThis function will return a vector of tuples `[(question, answer)]` where each question and answer pair is stripped of leading spaces and newlines. The example usage shows how to call the function with an input Markdown text and print the extracted questions and answers.","status":200,"tokens":[0,672],"elapsed":19.206464395,"_type":"aimessage"}]
