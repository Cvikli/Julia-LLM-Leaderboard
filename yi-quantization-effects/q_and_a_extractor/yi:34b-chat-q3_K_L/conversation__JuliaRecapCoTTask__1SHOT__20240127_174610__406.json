[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"### Recall Julia Snippets:\n- For parsing markdown content, use the `Markdown` module provided by Julia's standard library.\n- To extract specific sections, we can use regular expressions or iterate over the document structure provided by the `Markdown` module.\n- When extracting text, use the `String` type for readability and performance.\n\n### Solve the Task:\n```julia\nusing Markdown\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Initialize an empty list to store answers\n    answers = []\n\n    # Parse the markdown content\n    doc = parse(Markdown.Md, md)\n\n    # Iterate over the parsed document and look for \"Question\" and \"Answer\" headers\n    for node in doc\n        if typeof(node) == Markdown.Header && length(node.content) > 0 && node.content[1] == \"Question\"\n            answer = strip(String(first(findnext(isequal(\"Answer\"), node.children)).content))\n            push!(answers, (node.content[2:end], answer))\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return the answers as a tuple of tuples\n    return tuple(answers...)\nend\n```\n\n### Double-check Solution:\n- Test the function with various markdown texts containing multiple questions and answers.\n- Ensure that it handles cases where there are multiple levels of headers or non-standard formatting (e.g., `## QUESTION` instead of just `# Question`).\n- Verify that leading spaces and newlines are stripped from the extracted text.\n\n### Special Instructions:\n{{instructions}}\n\nPlease note that if you encounter any specific challenges or if the provided instructions are unclear, feel free to ask for clarification or additional information.","status":200,"tokens":[0,407],"elapsed":11.422902545,"_type":"aimessage"}]
