It then extracts the text after the headers by capturing the content in group 1 of the regex. The `eachmatch` function is used to iterate over all matches, and `m.captures[1]` accesses the first captured group for each match. Finally, a tuple of question and answer texts is returned after stripping leading whitespace and newlines from each text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,268],"elapsed":20.814723266,"_type":"aimessage"}]
