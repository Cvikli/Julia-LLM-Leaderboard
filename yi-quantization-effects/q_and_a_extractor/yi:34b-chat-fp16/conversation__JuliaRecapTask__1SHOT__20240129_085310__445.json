[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

It maintains two states: `in_question` and `in_answer`, which are used to determine whether a line should be added to the questions or answers array. When a line starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`, the corresponding state is set to true, and the current section's text is appended to the appropriate array. Once a section is complete (indicated by another `# Question` or `# Answer`), the text is stripped of leading whitespace and newlines, and the section's content is joined into a single string.\n\nThe function assumes that there is only one question and answer pair in the markdown text. If more than one pair exists, the function would need to be modified to handle multiple pairs or to take a different input format.","status":200,"tokens":[0,494],"elapsed":38.595491746,"_type":"aimessage"}]
