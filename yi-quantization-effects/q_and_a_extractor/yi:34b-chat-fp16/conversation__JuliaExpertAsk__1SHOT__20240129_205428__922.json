It then iterates through each pair of matches, ensuring that they are consecutive without any other heading interruptions. If so, it extracts the text between them, strips leading whitespace and newlines, and stores the question and answer in separate arrays. Finally, it returns a tuple with the first question and its corresponding answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,456],"elapsed":35.475032775,"_type":"aimessage"}]
