[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

It starts at the beginning of the document and searches for `# Question: ` headers. When one is found, it extracts the question text and then searches for the corresponding `# Answer:` header. The extracted question and answer texts are stripped of leading spaces and newlines, and the answers are stored in a dictionary keyed by the questions.\n\nIf no matching `Answer` is found for a `Question`, a warning is printed to the console, but the function continues to process the remaining content until it reaches the end of the document or there are no more questions.\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes that each question is followed by an answer and that the headers are always present and well-formatted. If the markdown contains other types of headers or if the structure is more complex, additional logic would be required to handle these cases.","status":200,"tokens":[11,485],"elapsed":37.902671053,"_type":"aimessage"}]
