[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Given the task description and special instructions, here's how I would approach solving this problem using Julia:\n\n1. **Recall Julia Snippets**:\n   - We will use regular expressions to match the patterns for questions and answers.\n   - We will use `split` to split the text into sections based on headers.\n   - We will use anonymous functions with `map` to process each section.\n\n2. **Solve the Task**:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)::Tuple{String, String}\n    # Define regular expressions for matching question and answer sections\n    question_re = Regex(\"^# Question\\\\s+([^\\\\n]+)\")\n    answer_re = Regex(\"^# Answer\\\\s+([^\\\\n]+)\")\n    \n    # Split the markdown text into sections\n    sections = split(md, \"\\n# \")\n    \n    # Filter out sections that do not start with a header (Question or Answer)\n    filtered_sections = filter(x -> occursin(r\"^# \", x), sections)\n    \n    # Extract question and answer from each section\n    question_answers = map(filtered_sections) do section\n        m1 = match(question_re, section)\n        m2 = match(answer_re, section)\n        \n        if m1 !== nothing && m2 !== nothing\n            # Extract text without leading spaces and newlines\n            return (strip(m1.captures[1]), strip(m2.captures[1]))\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Ensure at least one question-answer pair is found\n    if length(question_answers) >= 1\n        # Return the first question-answer pair\n        return first(question_answers)\n    else\n        error(\"No question and answer sections found in the markdown text.\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\n3. **Double-check that the Solution is Correct**:\n   - Ensure the function correctly extracts questions and answers from the provided markdown text.\n   - Test the function with different types of input to ensure it handles edge cases properly.\n\nPlease note that the `Special Instructions` placeholder in your task description is currently empty, so I've assumed there are no additional instructions beyond what was provided. If there are specific instructions or requirements for handling the markdown text, please include them, and I can adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,553],"elapsed":43.234454665,"_type":"aimessage"}]
