[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Julia Snippets for Task\n\nHere are some Julia snippets that might be useful for solving the task:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_qna(md::Markdown.MD)\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n    for (i, line) in enumerate(eachline(md))\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question = strip(readuntil(md, '\\n', from=i+1)[2:end])\n            push!(questions, question)\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer = strip(readuntil(md, '\\n', from=i+1)[2:end])\n            push!(answers, answer)\n        end\n    end\n    return questions, answers\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Markdown` package to parse the markdown text. It iterates over each line of the markdown document and looks for lines starting with `# Question` or `# Answer`. When it finds such a line, it strips any leading spaces and newlines from the following text until the next line break using `readuntil`. The questions and answers are then stored in separate arrays and returned as a tuple.\n\nPlease note that this snippet assumes that there is only one question and answer pair per markdown document. If multiple pairs are expected, the function would need to be modified accordingly.\n\n# Double-Checking the Solution\n\nTo double-check that the solution is correct, you can add some additional steps:\n\n1. Ensure that the `md` text provided contains valid Markdown syntax with sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n2. Test the function with a simple markdown document containing one question and answer pair to ensure it works as expected.\n3. Verify that the returned tuple has the correct number of elements and that each element is a string without leading spaces or newlines.\n4. If possible, test the function with edge cases like empty lines, non-standard whitespace, or malformed Markdown syntax to ensure it handles these situations gracefully.\n5. Check if the `Markdown` package has any built-in functions that could simplify the task (e.g., for parsing headers).\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nIf there are any special instructions provided, they should be followed explicitly. For example, if the user requires a different format for the returned tuple or if specific handling of certain markdown elements is needed, these instructions should be implemented in the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,555],"elapsed":43.36820874,"_type":"aimessage"}]
