[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can write a function to extract questions and answers from a markdown-formatted text by looking for sections that start with `# Question` and `# Answer`. The following code defines such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n    question_start = \"# Question\"\n    answer_start = \"# Answer\"\n    \n    for line in split(md, '\\n')\n        if startswith(line, question_start)\n            current_question = strip(readuntil(md, '\\n'))\n            push!(questions, current_question)\n        elseif startswith(line, answer_start)\n            current_answer = strip(readuntil(md, '\\n'))\n            push!(answers, current_answer)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (questions[1] => answers[1])\nend\n```\n\nThis function works as follows:\n\n1. It searches through each line of the `md` text.\n2. If a line starts with `# Question`, it strips leading spaces and newlines from the remaining text until the next newline to extract the current question.\n3. If a line starts with `# Answer`, it strips leading spaces and newlines from the remaining text until the next newline to extract the current answer.\n4. It then returns a tuple where the first element is the first question found, and the second element is the corresponding answer.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes there is exactly one question and one answer in the markdown-formatted text. If you have multiple questions and answers, you would need to modify the function to handle a vector of questions and answers.","status":200,"tokens":[0,385],"elapsed":29.892448006,"_type":"aimessage"}]
