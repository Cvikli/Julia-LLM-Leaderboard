Here's an example of how you might implement such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regex to match sections starting with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\"\n    section_regex = r\"^(?:# (Question|Answer))+\"\n    questions = findall(section_regex, md)\n\n    # Initialize the result tuple\n    result = Tuple{String, String}[]\n\n    for i in 1:length(questions)-1 # We skip the last one because it might not have a matching pair\n        start_pos = questions[i].match.offset[1] + length(\"# Question\")\n        end_pos = questions[i+1].match.offset[1] - 1\n\n        # Extract the question text and strip leading whitespace\n        question = strip(md[start_pos:end_pos])\n\n        # Move to the next section\n        start_pos = end_pos + length(\"# Answer\")\n        end_pos = findnext(r\"^(?:# (Question|Answer))+\", md, start_pos).match.offset[1] - 1\n\n        # Extract the answer text and strip leading whitespace\n        answer = strip(md[start_pos:end_pos])\n\n        # Append the question-answer pair to the result tuple\n        push!(result, (question, answer))\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Markdown document with questions and answers\n\n# Question\nThis is a question.\n\n# Answer\nThis is the answer to the question.\n\n# Another question\nWhat about this one?\n\n# Answer\nNo problem, here's the answer.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestions_and_answers = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\nprintln(questions_and_answers)\n```\n\nThis function will output a tuple of strings where each string is a question-answer pair stripped of leading whitespace and newlines. Note that the function assumes there are no nested `# Question` or `# Answer` sections, and it only works with consecutive questions and answers without any other headings in between.\n\nAlso, be aware that this function uses a regular expression to find matches, which can be slow for very large documents. If performance is an issue, you might want to consider using a more sophisticated parsing approach or a dedicated markdown parser library.","status":200,"tokens":[0,620],"elapsed":48.229396421,"_type":"aimessage"}]
