When it finds such a line, it captures the text that follows using the `(.+)` group in the regex. The `strip()` function is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from the captured text. Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the question and the answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,316],"elapsed":24.544103204,"_type":"aimessage"}]
