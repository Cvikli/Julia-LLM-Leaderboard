[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n    current_section = :none\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if occursin(\"# Question\", line)\n            if current_section != :none\n                push!(answers, strip(join(lines[2:end], \"\\n\")))\n                break\n            end\n            current_section = :question\n        elseif occursin(\"# Answer\", line)\n            if current_section == :question\n                questions = strip(join(lines[1:(end-1)], \"\\n\"))\n                current_section = :answer\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return (questions, answers)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses `eachline` to iterate over the lines of the markdown text. It maintains a state variable `current_section` to keep track of whether it is in the \"Question\" or \"Answer\" section. When it encounters `# Question`, it starts collecting the question text if it's not already in the \"Answer\" section. Conversely, when it sees `# Answer`, it collects the answer text if it's in the \"Question\" section.\n\nThe `strip` function is used to remove leading whitespace and newlines from the collected text, and `join` is used to concatenate the lines together with `\\n` as the separator.\n\nFinally, the function returns a tuple containing the question and answer texts.","status":200,"tokens":[0,344],"elapsed":26.887891679,"_type":"aimessage"}]
