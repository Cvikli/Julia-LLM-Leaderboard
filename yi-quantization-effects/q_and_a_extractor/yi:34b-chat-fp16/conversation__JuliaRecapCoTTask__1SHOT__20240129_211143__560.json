[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n    current_section = :none\n\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if occursin(\"# Question\", line)\n            current_section == :question && push!(questions, strip(takewhile(x -> !occursin(\"# Answer\", x), lines)))\n            current_section = :question\n        elseif occursin(\"# Answer\", line)\n            current_section == :question && push!(answers, strip(takewhile(x -> !occursin(\"# Question\", x), lines)))\n            current_section = :answer\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (questions[1], answers[1])\nend\n```\n\nThis function assumes that there is only one question and answer pair in the markdown text. If there are multiple pairs, the function will only extract the first one. The `strip` function removes leading and trailing whitespace from each line, and `takewhile` ensures that we only take lines until the next section header or the end of the document.","status":200,"tokens":[0,267],"elapsed":20.841465058,"_type":"aimessage"}]
