[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = String[]\n    answers = String[]\n\n    for (level, content) in Markdown.parse(md)\n        if level == 1 && startswith(content, \"Question\")\n            question = strip(content[9:end]) # Strip leading spaces and newline from question title\n            questions = append!(questions, question)\n        elseif level == 1 && startswith(content, \"Answer\")\n            answer = strip(content[8:end]) # Strip leading spaces and newline from answer title\n            answers = append!(answers, answer)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (questions[1], answers[1])  # Assuming there is only one question and answer pair\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Markdown` package to parse the given markdown text. It loops through each level 1 header (`#`) in the document and checks if it starts with \"Question\" or \"Answer\". If so, it strips any leading spaces and newlines from the content of the header and appends it to the respective array.\n\nThe `strip(content[9:end])` is used because the `Markdown` package includes the line break before the title in the content array, which we want to remove. The `9:end` range selects all characters from the 9th character (excluding the first 8 which are leading spaces and a newline) to the end of the string.\n\nThe function then returns a tuple containing the first question and answer extracted from the markdown text. This assumes that there is only one question and answer pair in the document, as no special handling for multiple questions or answers is implemented. If more complex scenarios are expected, the function would need to be modified to handle them accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,411],"elapsed":32.094567923,"_type":"aimessage"}]
