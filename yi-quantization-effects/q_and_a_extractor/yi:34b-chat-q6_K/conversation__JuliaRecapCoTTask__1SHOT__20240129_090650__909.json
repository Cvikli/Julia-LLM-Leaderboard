[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = findall(r\"^# Question\\n([^\\n]+\\n)\", md)\n    answers = findall(r\"^# Answer\\n([^\\n]+\\n)\", md)\n    \n    qas = Tuple{String, String}[]\n    for (i, question_idx) in enumerate(questions)\n        if i > 1 && answers[i - 1][end] == '?' # Handle case where there is no space after the '?'\n            answers[i - 1] *= \" \"  # Prepend a space to the previous answer if necessary\n        end\n        answer_idx = findfirst(r\"^# Answer\\n\", md, nextind(md, question_idx) + 1)\n        if answer_idx === nothing\n            throw(ErrorException(\"Missing # Answer for $question_idx\"))\n        end\n        qas += [(strip(split(md, r\"^# Question\\n|# Answer\\n\")[question_idx]), strip(split(md, r\"^# Question\\n|# Answer\\n\")[answer_idx]))]\n    end\n    return qas\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by finding all occurrences of `# Question` and `# Answer` in the markdown text. It then strips leading spaces and newlines from the text between these headers to extract the question and answer pairs. The tuples are then collected into a list and returned as the result.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is at least one space after the `?` character at the end of the question, but it handles the case where this space is missing by appending an extra space to the previous answer. If there is no previous answer (i.e., for the first question), this check has no effect.\n\nIf you encounter any issues or have questions about this solution, please let me know and I'll be happy to assist you further.","status":200,"tokens":[0,455],"elapsed":17.136035059,"_type":"aimessage"}]
