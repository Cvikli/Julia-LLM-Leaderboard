[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = Vector{String}()\n    answers = Vector{String}()\n    current_section = \"\"\n\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if occursin(\"# Question\", line)\n            current_section == \"question\" && push!(questions, strip(join(questions)))\n            current_section = \"question\"\n        elseif occursin(\"# Answer\", line)\n            current_section == \"answer\" && push!(answers, strip(join(answers)))\n            current_section = \"answer\"\n        elseif current_section != \"\"\n            push!(current_section == \"question\" ? questions : answers, line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (questions[1], answers[1])\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each line in the markdown text and keeping track of whether we are in a `# Question` or `# Answer` section. When it encounters one of these headers, it creates an empty vector for storing the text from that section and begins appending subsequent lines to it until the next header is encountered or the end of the document is reached.\n\nAfter processing the entire markdown text, it returns a tuple containing the first question and answer extracted. If there are multiple questions and answers, only the first pair is returned. This function assumes that each `# Question` and `# Answer` section is followed by at least one non-empty line of text.","status":200,"tokens":[412,348],"elapsed":13.343917192,"_type":"aimessage"}]
