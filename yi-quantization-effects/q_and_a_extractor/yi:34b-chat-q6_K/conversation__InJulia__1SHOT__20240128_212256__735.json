Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

It then joins these arrays with newline characters to create a single string for the question and answer.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes the markdown text is well-formatted, meaning that each `# Question` header is followed by at least one question and each `# Answer` header is preceded by at least one question. If the markdown does not follow this structure, the function may not work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[101,448],"elapsed":16.822924618,"_type":"aimessage"}]
