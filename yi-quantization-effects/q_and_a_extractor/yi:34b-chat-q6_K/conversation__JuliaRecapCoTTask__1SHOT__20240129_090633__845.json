[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Given the task and special instructions provided, here is a function that extracts questions and answers from a markdown-formatted text:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store questions and answers\n    qas = Dict{String, String}()\n\n    # Parse the markdown text into a document\n    document = parse(md)\n\n    # Iterate over all headings (which represent questions and answers) in the document\n    for element in findall(isequal(Markdown.Header), document)\n        # Check if the heading is for a question or answer\n        if hasoccurred(element, \"Question\")\n            question = strip(String(element.content))\n            qas[question] = \"\"\n        elseif hasoccurred(element, \"Answer\")\n            answer = strip(String(element.content))\n            # Add the answer to the dictionary\n            qas[last(keys(qas))] = answer\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return the extracted questions and answers as a tuple\n    return (; questions=collect(keys(qas)), answers=collect(values(qas)))\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses Julia's `Markdown` standard library to parse the markdown text into an abstract syntax tree. It then iterates over all headings in the document and checks if they are for questions or answers. If a heading is for a question, it is added to the dictionary with an empty answer. If it's for an answer, the corresponding question from the dictionary is found, and its answer is updated.\n\nAfter parsing all the questions and answers, the function returns a tuple containing two vectors: one with the questions and another with the answers.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no nested headings and that every `# Question` heading is followed by at least one `# Answer` heading. If these assumptions do not hold, additional logic would be needed to handle such cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,452],"elapsed":17.028217623,"_type":"aimessage"}]
