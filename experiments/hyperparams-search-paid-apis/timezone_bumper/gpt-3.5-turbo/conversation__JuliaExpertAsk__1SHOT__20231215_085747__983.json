It increases the provided timestamp `dt` by `bump` hours and returns the result.\n\nNote that the `bump` value is expected to be an integer. If a non-integer value is provided, Julia will throw a `MethodError` automatically. This function will throw a `MethodError` if a Date type is provided instead of a DateTime type, as Date types don't have a notion of hours.","status":200,"tokens":[102,150],"elapsed":4.125800417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
