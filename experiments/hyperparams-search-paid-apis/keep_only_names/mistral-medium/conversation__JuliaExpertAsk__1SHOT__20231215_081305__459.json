In this case, the predicate is a lambda function that checks if the first character of a word is an uppercase letter using the `isupper` function from the `Base` module and the `first` function from the Julia standard library.","status":200,"tokens":[106,133],"elapsed":12.731096208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
