The condition used here is a lambda function that checks whether the first character of the word is an uppercase letter, which is done using the `isupper` function from the `Base` module. The `first` function is used to get the first character of the word.","status":200,"tokens":[106,142],"elapsed":3.162130958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
