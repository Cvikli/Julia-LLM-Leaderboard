In this case, the predicate function checks if the first character of a word is an uppercase letter by using the `isupper` function from the `Base` library.\n\nNote that this function modifies the input `words` collection instead of creating a new one, so make sure to create a copy of the original collection if you need to preserve it.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that this function assumes that the input is a collection of strings. If the input can contain other types of elements, you may need to add additional type checks or error handling.","status":200,"tokens":[106,193],"elapsed":8.055942875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
