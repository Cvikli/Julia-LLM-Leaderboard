The filter function is used to keep only the elements for which the provided function returns true. In this case, the provided function is `isupper(first(word))` which checks if the first character of each word is an uppercase letter.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the words in the input list are strings. If they might not be, you could modify the function to handle that case by adding a check for the string type:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filter(word -> isa(word, String) && isupper(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\n\nThis modified function checks that each element of the input list is a string, and if so, checks whether its first character is uppercase. If the element is not a string, it will be filtered out.","status":200,"tokens":[106,252],"elapsed":5.655970417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
