The supplied function checks if the first character of each word is an uppercase letter using the `isupper` function from the `Char` module and the `first` function from the Base library.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input array `words` contains only strings. If the input array can contain other types of elements, you may want to add additional checks to ensure that the function behaves correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[106,178],"elapsed":17.507832042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
