It uses the `filter` function to iterate over each word (`x`) in the list and checks if the first character (`first(x)`) is an uppercase letter (`isupper`). If the condition is true, the word is included in the resulting list.","status":200,"tokens":[99,98],"elapsed":2.805820166,"_type":"aimessage"}]
