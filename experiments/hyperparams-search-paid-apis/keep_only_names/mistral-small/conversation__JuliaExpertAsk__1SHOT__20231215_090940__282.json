If a word is capitalized (i.e., it starts with a capital letter), it is added to a new list called `filtered_words`. Finally, the function returns the `filtered_words` list.\n\nNote that I've used the built-in `iscapitalized` function to check if a word starts with a capital letter. This function returns `true` if the first character is an ASCII letter and is uppercase, and `false` otherwise.","status":200,"tokens":[109,207],"elapsed":2.791455084,"_type":"aimessage"}]
