Only the elements for which the predicate returns `true` will be kept in the collection.\n\nThe predicate function checks if the word starts with a capital letter by comparing the first character of the word (`word[1]`) to its uppercase version (`uppercase(word[1])`). If they are the same, then the word starts with a capital letter and the predicate returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false` and the word is removed from the collection.","status":200,"tokens":[109,212],"elapsed":2.97668875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
