Here's a more concise version that uses a regular expression:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filter(word -> startswith(word, r\"[A-Z]\"), words)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `startswith` function with a regular expression `[A-Z]` to check if a word starts with a capital letter. The `filter` function is then used to create a new array that only contains the words that satisfy the condition.","status":200,"tokens":[109,210],"elapsed":2.940568417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
