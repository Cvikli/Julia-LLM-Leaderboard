Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Answer\n\nYou can use the `Dates.format` function from the `Dates` module to extract the year and month from the `DateTime` objects in the `dt` column. Here's a possible implementation for the `add_yearmonth` function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame, dt_col::Symbol, ym_col::Symbol)\n    df[!, ym_col] = Dates.format.(df[!, dt_col], \"yyyymm\")\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nIn this implementation, `df` is the input DataFrame, `dt_col` is the symbol representing the name of the `DateTime` column, and `ym_col` is the symbol representing the name of the new column to be added.\n\nThe `Dates.format` function is used to format the `DateTime` objects in `dt_col` according to the specified format string \"yyyymm\". The `.` notation after `Dates.format` is used to vectorize the function, allowing it to be applied element-wise to all elements in the column.\n\nFinally, the new column `ym_col` is added to the DataFrame with the formatted year and month values, and the modified DataFrame is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[110,246],"elapsed":5.706675375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
