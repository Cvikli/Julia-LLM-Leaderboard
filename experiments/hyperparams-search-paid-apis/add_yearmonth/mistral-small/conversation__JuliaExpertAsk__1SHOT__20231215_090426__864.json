The `DateTime.(df.dt)` expression converts the `dt` column to an array of `DateTime` objects, on which we can then call the `year` and `month` functions to extract the year and month. These are then concatenated together as an integer in the desired \"yyyymm\" format.","status":200,"tokens":[122,192],"elapsed":2.686827,"_type":"aimessage"}]
