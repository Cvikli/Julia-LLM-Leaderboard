It first creates an array of year-month strings using the `map` function and then converts these strings to integers using `parse(Int, string())`. The `:` before the column names in the first line denotes that we're creating or modifying a column in the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[122,183],"elapsed":1.67779725,"_type":"aimessage"}]
