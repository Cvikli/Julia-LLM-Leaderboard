It extracts the year and month from each DateTime value using the `year` and `month` functions from the `DateTime` type, and stores them as new columns `:year` and `:month` in the DataFrame.\n\nThen, a new column `:ym` is added using the `map` function to create a new array of strings by concatenating the year and month and converting each to an integer. The resulting DataFrame is returned at the end.","status":200,"tokens":[122,225],"elapsed":1.980539875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
