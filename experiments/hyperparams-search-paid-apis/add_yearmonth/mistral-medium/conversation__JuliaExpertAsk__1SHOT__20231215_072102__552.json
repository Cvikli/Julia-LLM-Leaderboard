It uses the `Dates.year` and `Dates.month` functions to extract the year and month, respectively. The `string` function is used to convert the year to a string with leading zeros, and the `*` operator is used to concatenate the year and month strings together. The resulting string is then assigned to the new `ym` column in the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[120,200],"elapsed":8.73729025,"_type":"aimessage"}]
