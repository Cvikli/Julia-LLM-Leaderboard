The `!` sign in the function name is a Julia convention to indicate that the function modifies its argument.\n\nIf you'd prefer to return a new DataFrame without modifying the original, you can create a copy before calling the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    df_copy = copy(df)\n    add_yearmonth!(df_copy)\n    return df_copy\nend\n```\n\nNow you can call `new_df = add_yearmonth(df)` to get a new DataFrame with the additional `ym` column.","status":200,"tokens":[120,223],"elapsed":5.080955708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
