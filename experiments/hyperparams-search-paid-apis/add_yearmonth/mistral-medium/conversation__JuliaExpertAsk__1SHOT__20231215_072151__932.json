It then creates a new array of `DateTime` objects for each unique year and month combination. Next, it concatenates the year and month as a string in the format \"yyyymm\" using the `string` function and adds it to the DataFrame as a new column called `ym`.\n\nNote: The `pad = 2` argument is used to ensure that the month is always displayed with two digits, even if it is a single-digit number.","status":200,"tokens":[120,241],"elapsed":5.38034,"_type":"aimessage"}]
