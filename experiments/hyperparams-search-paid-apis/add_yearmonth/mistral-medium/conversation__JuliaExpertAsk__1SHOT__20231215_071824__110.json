Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible solution:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    df[:ym] = [ string(Dates.year(dt), pad(Dates.month(dt), 2, '0')) for dt in df[:dt] ]\n    return df\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `Dates` module to extract the year and month from each `DateTime` element in the `dt` column of the input `DataFrame` `df`. It then concatenates the year and month as a string, with the month padded with leading zeros to ensure it's always two digits. The resulting string is stored in a new column `ym` of the input `DataFrame`.\n\nThe function returns the modified `DataFrame` with the new column added.\n\nNote that the `pad` function used here is a helper function that can be defined as follows:\n```julia\nfunction pad(n::Int, width::Int, c::Char)\n    return string(repeat([c], max(width - length(string(n)), 0))..., n)\nend\n```\nThis function pads an integer `n` with leading characters `c` to ensure it's a string of length `width`.","status":200,"tokens":[120,278],"elapsed":22.07118425,"_type":"aimessage"}]
