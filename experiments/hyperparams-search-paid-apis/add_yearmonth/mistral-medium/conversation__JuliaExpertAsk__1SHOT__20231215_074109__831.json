The `year` and `month` functions extract the year and month from the `dt` column, and then `string`, `lpad`, and `parse` functions are used to format and convert the results to an integer. The `!` in the function name indicates that it mutates its input.\n\nNote: The `using` statement imports the necessary packages `DataFrames` and `Dates` for working with DataFrames and DateTime objects respectively.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to create a DataFrame `df` with a `dt` column, and then apply the `add_yearmonth!` function to add the desired `ym` column. The resulting DataFrame is printed to the console using the `println` function.","status":200,"tokens":[120,340],"elapsed":9.094275125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
