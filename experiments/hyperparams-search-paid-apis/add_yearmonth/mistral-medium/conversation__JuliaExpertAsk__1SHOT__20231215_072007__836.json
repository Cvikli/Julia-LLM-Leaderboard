It then multiplies the year by 100 and adds the month to create an integer in the format \"yyyymm\". This new column is added to the DataFrame and returned.\n\nNote: The `Dates` package is required to use the `Dates.year` and `Dates.month` functions. If it is not already installed, it can be added to the project using the `Pkg` package manager by running `Pkg.add(\"Dates\")`.","status":200,"tokens":[120,205],"elapsed":4.614431958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
