It uses the `YearMonth` type from the `Dates` module to extract the year and month, then concatenates them as a string and parses the result as an integer.\n\nThe `!` in the function name `add_yearmonth!` indicates that it mutates the input DataFrame, following Julia's naming conventions.","status":200,"tokens":[120,265],"elapsed":8.810731,"_type":"aimessage"}]
