The resulting vector of year-month values is assigned to a new column `ym` in the original DataFrame.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the `dt` column is already of type `DateTime`. If it is not, you may need to convert it first using the `DateTime` constructor.","status":200,"tokens":[120,177],"elapsed":12.917588583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
