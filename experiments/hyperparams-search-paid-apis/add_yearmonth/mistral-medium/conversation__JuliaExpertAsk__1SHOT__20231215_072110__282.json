It uses `Year()` and `Month()` functions from `Dates` module to extract the corresponding year and month values from the `:dt` column, and then combines them using `combine()` function. Finally, it multiplies the year by 100 and adds the month to obtain the desired format.","status":200,"tokens":[120,190],"elapsed":8.394291833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
