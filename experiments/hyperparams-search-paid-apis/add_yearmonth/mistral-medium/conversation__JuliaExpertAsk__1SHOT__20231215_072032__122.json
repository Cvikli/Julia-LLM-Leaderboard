Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible solution:\n```\nusing Dates, DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    yearmonth = [ Dates.Year(dt) * 100 + Dates.month(dt) for dt in df.dt ]\n    return DataFrame(ym = yearmonth, df)\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `Year` and `month` functions from the `Dates` module to extract the year and month from each date in the `dt` column, and then multiplies the year by 100 and adds the month to create the desired format. The resulting vector of year-month values is then used to create a new column `ym` in the original data frame using the `DataFrame` constructor.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the input data frame has a column called `dt` containing date values. If this is not the case, you will need to modify the code accordingly.\n\nAlso note that this function returns a new data frame with the `ym` column added, rather than modifying the input data frame in place. If you want to modify the input data frame instead, you can do so by assigning the result of the function to the original data frame variable, like so:\n```\ndf = add_yearmonth(df)\n```\nAlternatively, you can modify the function to mutate the input data frame in place by adding the following line at the beginning of the function:\n```\ndf[:ym] = yearmonth\n```\nThis will create a new column `ym` in the input data frame and populate it with the year-month values.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.","status":200,"tokens":[120,363],"elapsed":8.071043375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
