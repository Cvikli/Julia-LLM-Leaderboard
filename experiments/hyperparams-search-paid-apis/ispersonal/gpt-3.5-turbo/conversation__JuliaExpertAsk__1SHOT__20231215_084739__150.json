All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Answer\n\nHere is the implementation of the `ispersonal` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::Type{<:AbstractVehicle})\n    if vehicle == Car || vehicle == Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif vehicle == Bus || vehicle == Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\nispersonal(Car)  # returns true\nispersonal(Motorcycle)  # returns true\nispersonal(Bus)  # returns false\nispersonal(Truck)  # returns false\nispersonal(SUV)  # returns false (assuming SUV is a subtype of AbstractVehicle)\n```\n\nNote that `ispersonal` takes a type as an argument (`::Type{<:AbstractVehicle}`) rather than an instance of a vehicle object.","status":200,"tokens":[134,174],"elapsed":4.39183725,"_type":"aimessage"}]
