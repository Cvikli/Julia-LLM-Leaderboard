The `ispersonal` function takes in a type and checks if it is a subtype of Car or Motorcycle, in which case it returns `true`. Otherwise, if the type is a subtype of Bus or Truck, it returns `false`. For any other subtype of AbstractVehicle, it also returns `false` as a default. We test the function with various types to verify its behavior.","status":200,"tokens":[134,273],"elapsed":6.607025375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
