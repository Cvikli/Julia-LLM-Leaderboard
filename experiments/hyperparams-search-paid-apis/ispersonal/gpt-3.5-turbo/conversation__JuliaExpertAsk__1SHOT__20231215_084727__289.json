All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Answer\n\nHere is an implementation of the `ispersonal` function:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::Type{T}) where T<:AbstractVehicle\n    if T == Car || T == Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T == Bus || T == Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car))             # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle))      # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus))             # false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck))           # false\nprintln(ispersonal(AbstractVehicle)) # false\n```\n\nI have assumed that the `ispersonal` function is defined to accept a type parameter (e.g., `Car`, `Motorcycle`) rather than an instance of a vehicle object. If you need to determine whether a given instance of `AbstractVehicle` is a personal vehicle, you can modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[134,233],"elapsed":6.366125041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
