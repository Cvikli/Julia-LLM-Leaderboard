The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The `ispersonal` function is defined using Julia's multiple dispatch feature, which allows the function to behave differently based on the provided type. The first two definitions of `ispersonal` return `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle`, and the default definition returns `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.","status":200,"tokens":[146,284],"elapsed":3.832606166,"_type":"aimessage"}]
