All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the `ispersonal` function that meets the requirements:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Car) = true\nispersonal(::Motorcycle) = true\nispersonal(::AbstractVehicle) where {T<:AbstractVehicle} = false\n\n# Example\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n```\n\nThe `ispersonal` function uses Julia's multiple dispatch feature to define specific behavior for each type. The first two definitions (`ispersonal(::Car)` and `ispersonal(::Motorcycle)`) are more specific than the third one (`ispersonal(::AbstractVehicle)`), so they will be chosen if the argument is a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`. The third definition acts as a catch-all for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, returning `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[146,284],"elapsed":4.194493291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
