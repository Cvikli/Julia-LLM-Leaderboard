The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

We then define the `ispersonal` function with three different method signatures. The first two methods return `true` for Car and Motorcycle, and the third method returns `false` for any other AbstractVehicle subtype. The function defaults to `false` for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. The example demonstrates the usage of the `ispersonal` function with instances of Car, Motorcycle, Bus, and Truck.","status":200,"tokens":[146,290],"elapsed":3.901737334,"_type":"aimessage"}]
