The provided function uses multiple dispatch to handle different subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`. The first method handles `Car` and `Motorcycle`, while the second method handles all other subtypes of `AbstractVehicle` and defaults to `false`. Note that the `ispersonal` function will throw a `MethodError` if called with the abstract type `AbstractVehicle`, since no method is defined for it.","status":200,"tokens":[150,425],"elapsed":9.440952584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
