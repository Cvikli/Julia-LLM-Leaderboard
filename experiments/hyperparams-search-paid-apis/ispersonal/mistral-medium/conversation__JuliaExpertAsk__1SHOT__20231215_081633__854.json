All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can create a function `ispersonal` with the following implementation:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Type{<:AbstractVehicle}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = true\n\n# Example usage:\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(AbstractVehicle)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Union{Car, Motorcycle})\nMethodError: no method matching ispersonal(::Type{Union{Car, Motorcycle}})\n\nClarify that the function expects a concrete Type (e.g., Car, Motorcycle), not a union or abstract type.\n```\n\nThis implementation uses multiple dispatch to define different behaviors for the `ispersonal` function based on the provided type. It covers the specific cases for `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`, and defaults to `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.","status":200,"tokens":[150,338],"elapsed":18.464665625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
