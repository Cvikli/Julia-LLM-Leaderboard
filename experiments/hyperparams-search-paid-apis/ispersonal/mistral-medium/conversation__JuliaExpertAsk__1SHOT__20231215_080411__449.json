All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the function you're looking for:\n\n```julia\nispersonal(::Type{<:AbstractVehicle}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = true\n```\n\nThis function defines a default return value of `false` for any subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. Then it overloads the function specifically for the types `Car` and `Motorcycle` to return `true`.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\njulia> abstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\njulia> struct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\n\njulia> struct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\n\njulia> struct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\n\njulia> struct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(SomeOtherVehicle) # Assume SomeOtherVehicle <: AbstractVehicle\nfalse\n```\n\nIn this example, I've created the `AbstractVehicle` type and its subtypes `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. The `ispersonal` function works as expected for these types, returning `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle`, and `false` for `Bus`, `Truck`, and any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.","status":200,"tokens":[150,382],"elapsed":10.367452292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
