It first lowers the case of the string using `lowercase()`, then strips any leading or trailing whitespaces using `strip()`. Lastly, it uses the `replace()` function with a regular expression to replace any multiple occurrences of whitespaces or hyphens with a single underscore. The resulting cleaned column name is returned as the function output.","status":200,"tokens":[117,155],"elapsed":1.502348084,"_type":"aimessage"}]
