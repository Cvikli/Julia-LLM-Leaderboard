It then calls the `lowercase()` function to convert the string to lowercase, and the `strip()` function to remove any leading or trailing whitespace. Finally, the `replace()` function is used to replace any spaces or hyphens with an underscore. The `r\"[\\s-]\"` pattern is used to match any whitespace or hyphen character.\n\nYou can test the function with the following example:\n\n```julia\njulia> clean_column(\"My Column\")\n\"my_column\"\n```\n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.","status":200,"tokens":[116,203],"elapsed":23.183005125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
