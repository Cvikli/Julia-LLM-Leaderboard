Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Here is the function `weather_data_analyzer` implemented in Julia that performs the requested statistical analysis:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Number})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    trend = :stable\n\n    if all(diff(temps) .> 0)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(diff(temps) .< 0)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n\n    return (; average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nPlease ensure that the `Statistics` package is in your current Julia environment to make the `mean` function available. You can add it using `using Pkg; Pkg.add(\"Statistics\")` if it isn't already included.","status":200,"tokens":[178,211],"elapsed":20.74379525,"_type":"aimessage"}]
