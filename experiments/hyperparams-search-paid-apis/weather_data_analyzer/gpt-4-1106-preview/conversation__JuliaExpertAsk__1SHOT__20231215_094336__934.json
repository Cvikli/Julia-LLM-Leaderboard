Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Here is the `weather_data_analyzer` function implemented in Julia, using the latest syntax guidelines:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    trend = if all(diff(temps) .> 0)\n        :increasing\n    elseif all(diff(temps) .< 0)\n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function utilizes the `Statistics` package to calculate the mean and uses built-in functions to find the maximum and minimum temperatures. It also computes the trend by checking if the differences between consecutive temperature values are always positive for an increasing trend, always negative for a decreasing trend, or otherwise classifies it as stable. The results are returned in a named tuple as requested.\n\nMake sure to include the `Statistics` package in your environment before running this function.","status":200,"tokens":[178,243],"elapsed":20.706619209,"_type":"aimessage"}]
