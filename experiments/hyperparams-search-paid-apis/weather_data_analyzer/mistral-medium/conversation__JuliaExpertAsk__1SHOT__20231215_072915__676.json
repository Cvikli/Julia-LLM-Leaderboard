Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible solution for your problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_val = maximum(temps)\n    min_val = minimum(temps)\n\n    diff = diff(temps)\n    trend = if all(>=(0), diff)\n        :increasing\n    elseif all(<=(0), diff)\n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=avg, max=max_val, min=min_val, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list is empty, and if so, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package. To calculate the trend, it uses the `diff` function to calculate the differences between consecutive elements in the list. If all differences are non-negative, the trend is set to `:increasing`. If all differences are non-positive, the trend is set to `:decreasing`. Otherwise, the trend is set to `:stable`. Finally, it returns a named tuple containing the calculated values.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the daily temperature data is given as a list of numbers, and that the list contains at least two elements if it is non-empty. If these assumptions do not hold for your use case, you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[192,392],"elapsed":10.4273725,"_type":"aimessage"}]
