Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of the `weather_data_analyzer` function:\n```\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_val = maximum(temps)\n    min_val = minimum(temps)\n\n    sorted_temps = sort(temps)\n    first_val = first(sorted_temps)\n    last_val = last(sorted_temps)\n\n    if last_val > first_val\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif last_val < first_val\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average = avg, max = max_val, min = min_val, trend = trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the input list `temps` is empty, and if so, returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. If the list is not empty, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package. It then sorts the list and compares the first and last values to determine the trend. Finally, it returns a named tuple with the calculated values.\n\nNote that the trend calculation assumes that a trend can be determined based on the first and last values in the list. This may not always be the case, especially if the list contains a large number of values. A more robust trend calculation could involve fitting a linear regression model to the data and checking the sign of the slope. However, this would require additional packages and would be beyond the scope of the original question.","status":200,"tokens":[192,412],"elapsed":19.814662042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
