Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the solution using the latest syntax of Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    delta = diff(sort(temps))\n    trend = if all(delta .>= 0)\n        :increasing\n    elseif all(delta .<= 0)\n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=average_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list is empty and returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing` in that case. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures. Then, it determines the trend based on the sorted daily temperature differences. If all differences are non-negative, the trend is `:increasing`. If all differences are non-positive, the trend is `:decreasing`. Otherwise, the trend is `:stable`. Finally, the function returns a named tuple with the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[192,310],"elapsed":7.032428125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
