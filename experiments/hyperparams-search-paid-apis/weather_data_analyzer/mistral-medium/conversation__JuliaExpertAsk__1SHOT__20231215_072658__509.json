Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a concise solution in Julia using the latest syntax:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_val = maximum(temps)\n    min_val = minimum(temps)\n\n    diff = diff(sort(temps))\n    trend = if all(d >= 0 for d in diff)\n        :increasing\n    elseif all(d <= 0 for d in diff)\n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=avg, max=max_val, min=min_val, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input list `temps` is empty, and if so, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\nIf the list is not empty, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package. It then calculates the trend by sorting the temperature data and finding the differences between consecutive values. The trend is set to `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable` based on the sign of these differences.\n\nFinally, the function returns a named tuple containing the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[192,337],"elapsed":7.577695709,"_type":"aimessage"}]
