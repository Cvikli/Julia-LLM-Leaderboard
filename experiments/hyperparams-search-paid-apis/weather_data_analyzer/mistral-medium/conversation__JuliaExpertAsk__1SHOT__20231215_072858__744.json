Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a brief and concise answer:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_val = maximum(temps)\n    min_val = minimum(temps)\n\n    diffs = diff(sort(temps))\n\n    if all(d <= 0 for d in diffs)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif all(d >= 0 for d in diffs)\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=avg, max=max_val, min=min_val, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty and returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures. To determine the trend, the function calculates the sorted list's pairwise differences and checks if they are all positive, negative, or a mix of both.","status":200,"tokens":[192,276],"elapsed":6.15864575,"_type":"aimessage"}]
