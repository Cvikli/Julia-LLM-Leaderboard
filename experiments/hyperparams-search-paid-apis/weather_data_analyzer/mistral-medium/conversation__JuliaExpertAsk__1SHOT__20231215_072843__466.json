Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a concise and precise solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_val = maximum(temps)\n        min_val = minimum(temps)\n\n        diff = diff(sort(temps))\n        trend = ifelse(all(diff .>= 0), :increasing,\n                       all(diff .<= 0), :decreasing,\n                       :stable)\n\n        return (; average=avg, max=max_val, min=min_val, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input list `temps` is empty and returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package. To determine the trend, the function sorts the temperature data and calculates the differences between consecutive values. It then assigns the `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable` symbol based on the sign of these differences. Finally, it returns a named tuple containing the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[192,308],"elapsed":6.899333792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
