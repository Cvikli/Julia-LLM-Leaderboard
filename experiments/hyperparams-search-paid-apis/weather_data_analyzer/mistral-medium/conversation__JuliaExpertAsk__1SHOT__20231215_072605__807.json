Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that achieves the desired behavior:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max = maximum(temps)\n    min = minimum(temps)\n\n    trend = if length(temps) < 3\n                :stable\n            elseif temps[end] > temps[1]\n                :increasing\n            elseif temps[end] < temps[1]\n                :decreasing\n            else\n                :stable\n            end\n\n    return (; average, max, min, trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input list `temps` is empty, and if so, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. If `temps` is not empty, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures. Then, it determines the trend by comparing the first and last elements of the list. If the last temperature is greater than the first one, the trend is `:increasing`, otherwise, if the last temperature is less than the first one, the trend is `:decreasing`. If the first and last temperatures are equal or the list contains fewer than three elements, the trend is `:stable`. Finally, the function returns a named tuple containing the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[192,329],"elapsed":7.35074575,"_type":"aimessage"}]
