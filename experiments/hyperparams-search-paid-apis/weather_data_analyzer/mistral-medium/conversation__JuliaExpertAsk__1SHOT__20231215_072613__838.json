Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the function that meets your requirements:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_val = maximum(temps)\n    min_val = minimum(temps)\n\n    diff = diff(sorted(temps))\n    trend = if all(x >= 0 for x in diff)\n        :increasing\n    elseif all(x <= 0 for x in diff)\n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=avg, max=max_val, min=min_val, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input list `temps` is empty and returns a named tuple with `nothing` values for all fields. Otherwise, it calculates the average, minimum, and maximum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package.\n\nNext, it computes the trend by sorting the temperature data and calculating the difference between consecutive elements. It then checks if all differences are positive, negative, or a mix of both to determine the trend and assign it to the `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable` symbol, respectively. Finally, it returns the named tuple containing the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[192,337],"elapsed":7.559376417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
