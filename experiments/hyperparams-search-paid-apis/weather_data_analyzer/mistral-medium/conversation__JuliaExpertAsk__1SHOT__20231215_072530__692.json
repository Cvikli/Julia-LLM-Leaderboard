Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a brief and concise solution to your problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max = maximum(temps)\n    min = minimum(temps)\n\n    if length(temps) < 2\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif all(diff(temps) .> 0)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(diff(temps) .< 0)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average, max, min, trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty and, if so, returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. If the list is not empty, it calculates the average, max, and min temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package.\n\nTo determine the trend, the function first checks if the list has fewer than 2 elements and sets the trend to `:stable` in that case. If the list has 2 or more elements, the function calculates the differences between consecutive elements using `diff(temps)` and checks if all differences are greater than 0 (increasing trend), less than 0 (decreasing trend), or neither, in which case it sets the trend to `:stable`.\n\nFinally, the function returns a named tuple containing the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[192,379],"elapsed":11.454334417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
