Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package. The trend is determined by sorting the temperature data, calculating the differences between consecutive elements, and then checking if all differences are non-negative (increasing trend), non-positive (decreasing trend), or neither (stable trend).","status":200,"tokens":[192,353],"elapsed":7.762890958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
