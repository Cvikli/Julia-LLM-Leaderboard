Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a solution for your problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_val = maximum(temps)\n    min_val = minimum(temps)\n    \n    diff = diff(sort(temps))\n    trend = if else(all(x >= 0 for x in diff), :increasing,\n                  all(x <= 0 for x in diff), :decreasing,\n                  :stable)\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=max_val, min=min_val, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty. If it's empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package. Then, it determines the trend by calculating the differences between sorted temperatures using the `diff` and `sort` functions. The trend is set to `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable` based on the sign of these differences. Finally, it returns a named tuple with the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[192,327],"elapsed":7.361711542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
