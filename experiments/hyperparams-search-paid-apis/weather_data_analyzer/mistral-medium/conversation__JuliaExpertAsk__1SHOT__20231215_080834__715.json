Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a solution that follows your requirements:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_val = maximum(temps)\n    min_val = minimum(temps)\n\n    sorted_temps = sort(temps)\n    first_day, last_day = sorted_temps[1], sorted_temps[end]\n\n    trend = if first_day < last_day\n        :increasing\n    elseif first_day > last_day\n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average = avg, max = max_val, min = min_val, trend = trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty, and if so, returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average, max, and min temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package.\n\nTo determine the trend, the function sorts the input list and compares the first and last elements. If the first day's temperature is lower than the last day's temperature, the trend is set to `:increasing`. If the first day's temperature is higher, the trend is set to `:decreasing`. If they are equal, the trend is set to `:stable`.\n\nThe function then returns a named tuple containing the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[192,373],"elapsed":25.226609458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
