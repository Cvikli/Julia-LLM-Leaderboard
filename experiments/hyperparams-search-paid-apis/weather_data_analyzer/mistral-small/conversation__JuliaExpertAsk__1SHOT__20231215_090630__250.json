When given a non-empty list, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `Statistics` package. To determine the trend, the function calculates the difference between consecutive temperature values and checks if they are all positive, negative, or mixed. The resulting trend is represented as `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`.","status":200,"tokens":[199,305],"elapsed":4.111955458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
