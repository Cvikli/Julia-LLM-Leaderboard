Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that meets the requirements:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    avg = isnan(mean(temps)) ? nothing : mean(temps)\n    max_temp = isnan(extrema(temps)[1]) ? nothing : extrema(temps)[2]\n    min_temp = isnan(extrema(temps)[2]) ? nothing : extrema(temps)[1]\n\n    trend = begin\n        if isempty(temps)\n            :stable\n        else\n            diff = diff(temps)\n            if all(diff .> 0)\n                :increasing\n            elseif all(diff .< 0)\n                :decreasing\n            else\n                :stable\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures. Since we want to return a `nothing` value if the input list is empty, we need to check for NaN values.\n\nNext, the function calculates the trend by comparing consecutive temperature values. If all differences are positive, the trend is `:increasing`. If all differences are negative, the trend is `:decreasing`. In any other case, the trend is `:stable`.\n\nFinally, the function returns a named tuple with the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[199,347],"elapsed":4.624862416,"_type":"aimessage"}]
