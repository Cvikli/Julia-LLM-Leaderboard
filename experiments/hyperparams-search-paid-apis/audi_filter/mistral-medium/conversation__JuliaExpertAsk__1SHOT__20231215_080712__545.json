Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the `audi_filter` function:\n```\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    # Filter down to rows with manufacturer \"audi\" and model \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\"\n    filtered_df = @subset(df_cars, :manufacturer .== \"audi\" && (:model .== \"a4\" || :model .== \"a4 quattro\"))\n    \n    # Create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows\n    filtered_df[:, :audi_a4_type] = true\n    \n    # Return the resulting DataFrame\n    return filtered_df\nend\n```\nNote that the `@subset` macro is a convenient way to filter a DataFrame based on certain conditions. It is equivalent to the `filter()` function, but allows for more readable and concise code. The `.==` operator is used for element-wise comparison, and the `:` prefix is used to indicate a column name.\n\nI hope this helps!
