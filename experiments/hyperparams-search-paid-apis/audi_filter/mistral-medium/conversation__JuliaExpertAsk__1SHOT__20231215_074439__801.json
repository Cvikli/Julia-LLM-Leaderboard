Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the function you're looking for:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    selected_rows = @subset(df_cars, :manufacturer .== \"audi\" && (:model .== \"a4\" || :model .== \"a4 quattro\"))\n    selected_rows[:, :audi_a4_type] = true\n    return selected_rows\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `@subset` macro from the `DataFrames` package, which allows for filtering based on conditions. The filtered DataFrame contains only the rows where the `manufacturer` is `\"audi\"` and the `model` is either `\"a4\"` or `\"a4 quattro\"`. A new column named `audi_a4_type` is added to the filtered DataFrame and is filled with `true` values for all rows. The final DataFrame is then returned as the result of the function.","status":200,"tokens":[149,214],"elapsed":4.852265083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
