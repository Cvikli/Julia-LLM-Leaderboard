It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the function `wrap_string` in Julia:\n```\nfunction wrap_string(s::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(s, \" \")\n    lines = Vector{String}()\n    current_line = \"\"\n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = \"\"\n        end\n        current_line *= word * \" \"\n    end\n    push!(lines, current_line)\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nExample usage:\n```\njulia> wrap_string(\"this is a long string that needs to be wrapped\", 15)\n\"this is a long\nstring that\nneeds to be\nwrapped\"\n```\nThe function first splits the input string into an array of words. It then initializes an empty array `lines` to store the lines of wrapped text. It also initializes an empty string `current_line` to store the current line being constructed.\n\nThe function then iterates over each word in the array of words. If adding the current word to the current line would exceed the maximum text width, the function adds the current line to the `lines` array and resets the current line to an empty string.\n\nAfter the loop, the function adds the final line to the `lines` array, and returns the concatenated lines with newlines in between.\n\nThe function defaults the `text_width` argument to 10 characters. This can be overwritten by passing a different value when calling the function.","status":200,"tokens":[102,368],"elapsed":8.205894833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
