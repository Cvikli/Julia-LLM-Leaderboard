The function splits the input text into words using the `split` function, and then uses two variables, `lines` and `line`, to keep track of the current line and the lines that have been formed. The function iterates through each word, checking if adding it to the current line would result in a line that is longer than the specified text width. If so, the current line is added to the list of lines, and a new line is started with the current word. Once all words have been processed, the final line is added to the list of lines. The function then returns the list of lines.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates the `wrap_string` function being called with a long string, and then the resulting lines being joined together and printed with newline characters in between.","status":200,"tokens":[103,384],"elapsed":7.939782666,"_type":"aimessage"}]
