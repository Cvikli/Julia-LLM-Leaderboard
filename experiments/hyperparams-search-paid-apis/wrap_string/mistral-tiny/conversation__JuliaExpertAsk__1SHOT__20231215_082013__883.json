It splits the input `String` into words and keeps track of each line in an array. When a line's length exceeds `text_width`, it pushes the current line to the output array and starts a new line with the next word. The final line is also added to the output array. The function returns the final string with all the words wrapped according to the given `text_width`.","status":200,"tokens":[103,357],"elapsed":6.842352666,"_type":"aimessage"}]
