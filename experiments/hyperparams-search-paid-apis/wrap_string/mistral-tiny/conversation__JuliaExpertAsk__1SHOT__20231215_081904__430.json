It then iterates through the words, maintaining a `lines` array that stores each line as a string and a `line` string that represents the current line being built. When the length of the current line plus the length of the next word would exceed `text_width`, the function adds the current line to the `lines` array and starts a new line with the next word. When all the words have been processed, the function adds the final line to the `lines` array and returns a new string that is the join of all the lines in the `lines` array with a newline character as the delimiter.","status":200,"tokens":[103,310],"elapsed":8.945571708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
