It splits the text into words, then iterates through each word. If adding the current word would cause the line length to exceed the text width, it starts a new line and appends the current word to it. After processing all the words, it returns the wrapped string as a single string with newline characters (`\\n`) between each line.","status":200,"tokens":[103,249],"elapsed":8.554870167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
