It splits the string into words using the `split` function, then iterates through the words. If adding the length of the current word and the space between words would exceed the `text_width`, it starts a new line by pushing the current line to the `lines` vector and initializing the `current_line` with the new word and a space. It continues this process until all words have been processed. Finally, it pushes the last line to the `lines` vector and joins all the lines with newlines using the `join` function.","status":200,"tokens":[103,344],"elapsed":5.997384667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
