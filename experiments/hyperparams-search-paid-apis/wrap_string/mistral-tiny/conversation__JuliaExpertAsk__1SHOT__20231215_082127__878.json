It splits the input string into words, then iterates through them. If the current line's length plus the length of the new word would exceed the text width, it pushes the current line to a list of lines and initializes a new empty line. The function continues to process the remaining words in the same manner. Once all words have been processed, the final line is pushed to the list of lines and the function returns a single string containing all lines joined by newline characters.","status":200,"tokens":[103,320],"elapsed":4.768713875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
