It splits the string into words and punctuation using a regular expression. Then, it iterates over the words and checks if adding the word to the current line would exceed the maximum line width. If it does, a new line is started. Finally, it joins the lines together and returns the wrapped string.","status":200,"tokens":[103,280],"elapsed":2.544697292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
