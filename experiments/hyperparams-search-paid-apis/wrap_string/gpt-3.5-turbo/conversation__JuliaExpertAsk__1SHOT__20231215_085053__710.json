It splits the text into words and checks if adding the current word to the current line exceeds the text width. If it does, it adds the current line to the list of lines and starts a new line with the current word. Otherwise, it appends the word to the current line. Finally, it joins all the lines with newline characters and returns the resulting wrapped string.","status":200,"tokens":[93,248],"elapsed":6.526762916,"_type":"aimessage"}]
