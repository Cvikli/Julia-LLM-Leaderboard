Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible solution using regular expressions to extract the Question and Answer sections:\n```\nusing Regex\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    q_re = r\"(?s)#\\s*Question\\s*^.*?(?=#\\s*Answer|$)\"\n    a_re = r\"(?s)#\\s*Answer\\s*^.*?(?=#|$)\"\n    q_match = match(q_re, md)\n    a_match = match(a_re, md)\n    question = q_match !== nothing ? strip(q_match.match) : \"\"\n    answer = a_match !== nothing ? strip(a_match.match) : \"\"\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThe function uses the `Regex` module to define two regular expressions `q_re` and `a_re` that match the text between `# Question` and `# Answer`, and between `# Answer` and the end of the string, respectively. The `match` function is used to search for these regular expressions in the input string `md`, and the `strip` function is used to remove leading and trailing whitespace from the matches. If no match is found, the function returns an empty string for the corresponding field.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the markdown text is well-formed and that the Answer section always follows the Question section. If the input text may not be well-formed, additional error checking may be necessary.","status":200,"tokens":[136,328],"elapsed":7.203730917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
