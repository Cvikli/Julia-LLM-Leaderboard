Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that should do what you're asking for:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = nothing\n    answer = nothing\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question = strip(split(line, \": \")[2])\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer = strip(split(line, \": \")[2])\n            break\n        end\n    end\n    return question, answer\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the input markdown text into lines and then iterating over each line. If a line starts with \"# Question\", it sets the `question` variable to the text following the \"Question: \" prefix, after stripping any leading spaces. If a line starts with \"# Answer\", it sets the `answer` variable to the text following the \"Answer: \" prefix, after stripping any leading spaces, and then breaks out of the loop. Once the loop is finished, the function returns the extracted `question` and `answer` as a tuple.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that each question and answer pair is separated by a line that starts with \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\", respectively. It also assumes that there are no empty lines between the question and answer text and the \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\" lines, respectively. If these assumptions are not met, the function may not work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[141,321],"elapsed":8.048636167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
