If the line does not start with either of these markers, the function continues to accumulate the text in the current section (question or answer). The function returns a tuple with the extracted question and answer text, with leading spaces and newlines stripped using the `strip` function.","status":200,"tokens":[141,317],"elapsed":4.306106,"_type":"aimessage"}]
