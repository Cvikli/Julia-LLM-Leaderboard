If it does, the function sets a flag to indicate whether it's currently processing the question or answer section, and initializes a new string to store the text.\n\nFor each line, if the flag is set to indicate that we're in the question or answer section, the function appends the stripped line to the current string.\n\nOnce the function has processed all the lines, it returns the question and answer strings as a tuple.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that there is only one question and answer section in the markdown text, and that they are in the correct order (i.e., the question comes before the answer). If this is not the case, the function may not work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[141,364],"elapsed":4.831050834,"_type":"aimessage"}]
