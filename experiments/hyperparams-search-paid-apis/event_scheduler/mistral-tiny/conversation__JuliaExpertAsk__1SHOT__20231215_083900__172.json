Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia using Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple})\n    events_sorted = sort(events, by = first)\n    prev_end = nothing\n\n    for (start, _) in events_sorted\n        if isnothing(prev_end) || start >= prev_end\n            prev_end = nothing\n        else\n            if start < prev_end\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n\n        prev_end = last(start)\n    end\n\n    length(events) > 0 ? \"No conflicts\" : \"No events\"\nend\n```\n\nThis `event_scheduler` function first sorts the events by their start time using the `sort` function with the `by` keyword and the `first` function to access the start time of each event. It keeps track of the end time of the previous event, and checks for conflicts by checking if the start time of the current event is before the end time of the previous event. If there is a conflict, it returns \"Conflict\", otherwise it continues to check the remaining events and returns \"No conflicts\" at the end if there are no conflicts or no events.","status":200,"tokens":[162,263],"elapsed":2.744297125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
