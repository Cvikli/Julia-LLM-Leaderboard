It sorts the events based on their start times and then checks for any conflicts by comparing the end time of the current event with the start time of the next event. If there is an overlap, a conflict is reported. If all events have ended before the last one, there are no conflicts.","status":200,"tokens":[162,333],"elapsed":2.959715917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
