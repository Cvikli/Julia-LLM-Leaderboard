Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia function that meets your requirements:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    sorted_events = sort(events, by = x -> parse(DateTime, x[1]))\n    unique_starts = unique(getindex.(sorted_events, 1))\n\n    for i in 1:length(unique_starts)-1\n        start1, end1 = sorted_events[findfirst(x -> x[1] == unique_starts[i], sorted_events)...]\n        start2, end2 = sorted_events[findfirst(x -> x[1] == unique_starts[i+1], sorted_events)...]\n\n        if start2 < end1\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function first sorts the events by their start times and checks if there are any overlapping start times. If there are no overlapping start times, it then iterates through the sorted list of events and checks if the end time of the current event is before the start time of the next event. If this condition is met, it means there is a conflict, and the function returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[162,308],"elapsed":4.161890292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
