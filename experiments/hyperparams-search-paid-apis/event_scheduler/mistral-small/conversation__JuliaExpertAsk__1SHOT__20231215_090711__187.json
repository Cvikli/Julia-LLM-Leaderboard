Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that meets your requirements:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    sorted_events = sort(events, by = x -> Dates.DateTime(x[1]))\n    unique_start_times = unique(getfield.(sorted_events, 1))\n\n    for start_time in unique_start_times\n        conflicting_events = filtered_events = sorted_events[start_time .<= getfield.(sorted_events, 1) .< start_time + Minute(30)]\n\n        if !isempty(conflicting_events)\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function first sorts the events based on their start times and checks for conflicts within a 30-minute window after each start time.

If no conflicts are found after checking all events, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[162,252],"elapsed":3.420069417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
