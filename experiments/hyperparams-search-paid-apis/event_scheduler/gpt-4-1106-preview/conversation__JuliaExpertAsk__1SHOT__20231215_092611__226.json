Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly!

If so, it returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, after checking all events, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[146,248],"elapsed":26.7900075,"_type":"aimessage"}]
