It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a brief and concise solution for your problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction word_to_pig_latin(word)\n    if isempty(word) || !isalpha(first(word))\n        return word\n    end\n    start = first(word)\n    remainder = word[2:end]\n    vowel_indices = findall(in([ 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' ]), word)\n    if isempty(vowel_indices) || vowel_indices[1] == 1\n        return string(remainder, start, \"ay\")\n    else\n        return string(remainder[1:vowel_indices[1]-1], start, remainder[vowel_indices[1]:end], \"ay\")\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(input_strings::Vector{String})\n    Threads.@threads for word in input_strings\n        input_strings[Threads.threadid()] = word_to_pig_latin(word)\n    end\n    return input_strings\nend\n```\n\nThis solution consists of two functions:\n\n1. `word_to_pig_latin`: This function takes a single word and transforms it to pig latin.\n2. `pig_latinify`: This function takes a vector of strings and applies the `word_to_pig_latin` function to each string in parallel using threads. The result is an updated vector of strings in pig latin.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes Julia version 1.6 or higher, which has the necessary multithreading support through the `Threads.@threads` macro. If you're using an older version, you might need to adjust the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[107,412],"elapsed":22.953243458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
