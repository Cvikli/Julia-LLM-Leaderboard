It handles words that start with a vowel, words that start with \"qu\", and words that start with a consonant. \n\nThe `pig_latinify` function takes in a vector of words and converts each word to Pig Latin using multiple threads. It uses Julia's `@distributed` macro to distribute the work among the available threads. \n\nThe `pig_latinify_parallel` function is an alternate version that also uses the `@distributed` macro, but it doesn't aggregate the results. The results are returned as remote references, which can be gathered separately if needed.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_serial` function is a serial version that runs the transformation sequentially.\n\nFinally, the code demonstrates the usage of the different functions using a vector of words and measures their execution time using the `@time` macro.","status":200,"tokens":[97,495],"elapsed":12.292404334,"_type":"aimessage"}]
