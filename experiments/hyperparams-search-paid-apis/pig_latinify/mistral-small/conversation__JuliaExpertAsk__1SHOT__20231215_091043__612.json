It then iterates over the input vector in parallel, using Julia's `Threads.@threads` macro. For each string, if it is empty, the function keeps it unchanged; otherwise, it moves the first letter to the end, adds \"ay\", and stores the result in the corresponding position of `result`. Finally, the function returns `result`.","status":200,"tokens":[107,253],"elapsed":3.730873292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
