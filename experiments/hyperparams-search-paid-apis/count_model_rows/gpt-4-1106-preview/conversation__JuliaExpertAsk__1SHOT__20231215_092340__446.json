Below is an example of a function `count_model_rows` in Julia using the `DataFrame` library (typically provided by the package DataFrames.jl) that groups the data by the `model` column and calculates the number of rows for each model:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    # Group by the `model` column\n    grouped = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n    \n    # Count the number of rows for each group\n    model_counts = combine(grouped, nrow => :count)\n    \n    return model_counts\nend\n```\n\nThis function accepts a DataFrame `df_cars` with at least a `model` column and returns a new DataFrame with the number of rows for each `model`. The `combine` function is used to apply a transformation (`nrow` to count the number of rows) and rename the result to `:count`.","status":200,"tokens":[89,193],"elapsed":17.94873375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
