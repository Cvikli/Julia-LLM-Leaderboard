The resulting object is a `GroupedDataFrame`. The `combine` function then takes this `GroupedDataFrame` and applies the `length ∘ group` function to each group, which calculates the number of rows in each group. The `names(df_cars) .=>` part specifies that we want to apply this function to every column of `df_cars`, but since we're only interested in the number of rows, we can just use the `:model` column. The resulting object is then converted back to a `DataFrame` using the `DataFrame` constructor.","status":200,"tokens":[99,312],"elapsed":4.253117417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
