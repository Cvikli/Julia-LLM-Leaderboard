Then, it calculates the number of rows for each group using `nrow` function and renames the `:count` column to `:num_rows`. Finally, it returns the resulting DataFrame containing the model names and their corresponding row counts.\n\nConfidence: 95%","status":200,"tokens":[98,200],"elapsed":6.367353834,"_type":"aimessage"}]
