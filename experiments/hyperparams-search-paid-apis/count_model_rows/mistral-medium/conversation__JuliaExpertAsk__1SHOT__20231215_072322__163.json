Inside the function, the DataFrame `df_cars` is grouped by the `:model` column using `groupby`. The `combine` function is then used to calculate the number of rows for each group using the `nrow` function and renames the result column to `:count`. The result is a new DataFrame containing the count of rows for each car model.","status":200,"tokens":[98,175],"elapsed":3.964123917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
