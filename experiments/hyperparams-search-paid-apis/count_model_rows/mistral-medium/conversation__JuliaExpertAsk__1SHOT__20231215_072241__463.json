The result is a new DataFrame with two columns: `model` and `count`, where `count` is the number of rows for each `model`.\n\nNote that the `nrow => :count` syntax creates an anonymous function that takes a DataFrame as input and returns the number of rows as output. The `:count` symbol is used to name the output column.\n\nConfidence: 95%","status":200,"tokens":[98,202],"elapsed":4.535315416,"_type":"aimessage"}]
