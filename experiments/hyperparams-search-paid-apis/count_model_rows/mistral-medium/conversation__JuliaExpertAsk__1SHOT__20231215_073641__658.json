The `combine` function then aggregates the data by counting the number of rows for each group. The result is a new DataFrame that contains the counts for each car model.\n\nNote that the `nrow` function is used to calculate the number of rows in each group, and the resulting value is assigned to a new column called `:count`. This is done using the `=>` operator, which is used to create a named function in Julia. In this case, the anonymous function `nrow => :count` maps the result of `nrow` to the symbol `:count`.\n\nI hope this helps!
