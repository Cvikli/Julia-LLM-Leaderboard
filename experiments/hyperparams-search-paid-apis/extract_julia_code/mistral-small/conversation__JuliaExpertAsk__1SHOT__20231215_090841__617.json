Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that should accomplish what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = []\n    current_block = IOBuffer()\n\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            if isopen(current_block)\n                push!(code_blocks, take!(current_block))\n            end\n            current_block = IOBuffer()\n        elseif endswith(line, \"```\") && startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            print(current_block, line[10:end-3]) # remove code fences\n            close(current_block)\n            current_block = IOBuffer()\n        else\n            if isopen(current_block)\n                print(current_block, line)\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    # add the last code block\n    if isopen(current_block)\n        push!(code_blocks, take!(current_block))\n    end\n\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a markdown string `md` as input and initializes an empty array `code_blocks` to store the extracted code blocks. It also initializes an `IOBuffer` `current_block` to store the current code block being built.\n\nThe function then iterates over each line in the markdown string. If a line starts with ```julia, the function removes the code fences (i.e., the backticks and the language identifier), adds the line to `current_block`, and starts a new code block. If a line ends with ``` and starts with ```julia, the function removes the code fences, adds the line to `current_block`, and closes the current code block. If a line is not a code fence, the function adds it to `current_block` if `current_block` is open.\n\nFinally, the function adds the last code block to `code_blocks`, if one exists, and returns a string with all the code blocks joined together with a newline.\n\nNote: This function assumes that the markdown string is well-formed, i.e., that every opening code fence has a corresponding closing code fence. If this assumption is not met, the function may not work correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[130,540],"elapsed":7.140420208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
