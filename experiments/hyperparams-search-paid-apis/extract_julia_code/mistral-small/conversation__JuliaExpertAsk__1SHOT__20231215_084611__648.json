Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that does what you described:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    code_blocks = []\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if startswith(line, \"`\")\n            push!(code_blocks, line[3:end-3])\n        elseif !isempty(code_blocks) && startswith(line, \"    \")\n            code_blocks[end] *= \"\\n\" * line[5:end-3]\n        elseif !isempty(code_blocks)\n            push!(code_blocks, code_blocks[end])\n            code_blocks[end] *= \"\\n\" * line[3:end-3]\n        elseif isempty(code_blocks) && endswith(line, \"```\")\n            error(\"Code block cannot be empty\")\n        end\n    end\n\n    if isempty(code_blocks)\n        return \"\"\n    elseif length(code_blocks) == 1\n        return code_blocks[1]\n    else\n        return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function uses a loop to iterate over each line in the input markdown document `md`. If a line starts and ends with backticks, it is a code block, and the code between the backticks is added to a list `code_blocks`. If a line starts with four spaces, it is a continuation of the previous code block, and the code from the previous line is concatenated with the current line, after adding a newline character between them. If a line does not match any of these conditions and the `code_blocks` list is not empty, the last code block in the list is closed with a newline character.\n\nAfter the loop finishes processing all lines, the function checks if the `code_blocks` list is empty or contains only one code block. If so, it returns the code block(s) as a single string. Otherwise, it joins all the code blocks together with a newline character and returns the resulting string.\n\nNote that if a code block is empty, the function will throw an error, as this is not a valid code block.","status":200,"tokens":[130,489],"elapsed":6.546565875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
