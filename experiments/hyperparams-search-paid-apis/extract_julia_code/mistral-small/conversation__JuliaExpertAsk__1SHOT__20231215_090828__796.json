Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = eachmatch(r\"(```{3}[\\s\\S]*?```{3})\", md)\n    result = String[]\n    for cb in code_blocks\n        stripped_cb = strip(cb.match, '`')\n        push!(result, stripped_cb)\n    end\n    return join(result, '\\n')\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `eachmatch` function from the `Regex` module to find all occurrences of triple backticks (```) in the markdown document. It then strips the leading and trailing triple backticks from each code block and stores the resulting code in an array. Finally, it joins the elements of the array into a single string with newline characters between them.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the code blocks are written in Julia and that they are enclosed in triple backticks. If the code blocks are enclosed in triple backticks with curly braces (```julia), you would need to modify the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[130,266],"elapsed":3.586605917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
