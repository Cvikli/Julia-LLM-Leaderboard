Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that should accomplish what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = eachmatch(r\"(```{3}(julia|jl)\\n([\\s\\S]*?)\\n```{3})\", md)\n    result = String[]\n    for cb in code_blocks\n        push!(result, cb.match[3])\n    end\n    return join(result, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the regular expression `(```{3}(julia|jl)\\n([\\s\\S]*?)\\n```{3})` to match Julia code blocks in the markdown document. The `([\\s\\S]*?)` part of the regular expression captures the actual code in the code block. The function then extracts the captured code and joins them together with a newline character.\n\nNote that the regular expression looks for both \"julia\" and \"jl\" as the language identifier for Julia code blocks. This is to accommodate both the old and new syntax for Julia code blocks in markdown documents.","status":200,"tokens":[130,260],"elapsed":3.543722209,"_type":"aimessage"}]
