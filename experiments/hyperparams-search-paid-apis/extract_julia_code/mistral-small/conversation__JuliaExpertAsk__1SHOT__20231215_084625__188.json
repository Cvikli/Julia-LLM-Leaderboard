Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that should accomplish what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = []\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n\n    current_block = IOBuffer()\n    in_code_block = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && in_code_block\n            in_code_block = false\n            push!(code_blocks, String(take!(current_block)))\n            current_block = IOBuffer()\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if in_code_block\n            write(current_block, line, '\\n')\n        end\n    end\n\n    return join(code_blocks, '\\n')\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each line in the input markdown document. If it encounters a line that starts with \"```julia\", it sets a flag to indicate that we are inside a code block. Any subsequent lines are then written to an `IOBuffer` until we encounter another line that starts with \"```\", at which point we add the contents of the `IOBuffer` to an array of code blocks. Finally, we join all of the code blocks together with a newline and return the result.","status":200,"tokens":[130,323],"elapsed":4.302406917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
