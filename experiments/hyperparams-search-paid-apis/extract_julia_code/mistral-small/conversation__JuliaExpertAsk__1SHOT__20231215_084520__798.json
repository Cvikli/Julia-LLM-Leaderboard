Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that does what you described:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    code_blocks = []\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            push!(code_blocks, \"\")\n        elseif endswith(line, \"```\")\n            # remove trailing newline\n            pop!.(code_blocks)\n        else\n            push!(code_blocks, code_blocks[end] * line)\n        end\n    end\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `eachline` function to iterate over the lines in the markdown document. It keeps track of any code blocks it finds using the `code_blocks` array. When it encounters a line that starts with ```julia, it knows it has found the start of a code block and creates a new empty string in the `code_blocks` array to store the code. When it encounters a line that ends with ```, it knows it has found the end of a code block and removes any trailing newline characters from the code block. Finally, it uses the `join` function to join all the code blocks together with a newline character and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[130,287],"elapsed":6.233937125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
