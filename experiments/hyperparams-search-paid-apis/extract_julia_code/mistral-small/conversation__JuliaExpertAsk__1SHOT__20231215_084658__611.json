[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise. You're precise and answer only when you're confident in the high quality of your answer.","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Question\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that should accomplish what you're asking for:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = eachmatch(r\"(```{3}[\\s\\S]*?```{3})\", md)\n    result = String[]\n    for cb in code_blocks\n        code = cb.match[4:end-3]  # remove code fences\n        push!(result, code)\n    end\n    return join(result, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThe function uses the `eachmatch` function to find all code blocks in the input markdown string. It then loops through the code blocks, removes the code fences (i.e., the triple backticks), and appends the resulting code block to a result array. Finally, the function joins the code blocks in the result array with a newline character and returns the resulting string.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the code blocks are written in Julia and are enclosed in triple backticks (i.e., ```). If the code blocks use a different syntax or language, the regular expression used in `eachmatch` may need to be modified accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[130,266],"elapsed":3.56655875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
