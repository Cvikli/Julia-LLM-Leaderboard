Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that should accomplish what you're asking for:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Use regular expressions to find all Julia code blocks\n    code_blocks = eachmatch(r\"(```julia\\n([\\s\\S]*?)(\\n\\n|\\\\n\\n|\\\\n|$))\", md)\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the extracted code\n    extracted_code = IOBuffer()\n\n    # Loop through each code block and write the code to the extracted_code buffer\n    for cb in code_blocks\n        write(extracted_code, cb.match[2])\n        if !eof(cb)\n            write(extracted_code, '\\n')\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Convert the IOBuffer to a string and return it\n    return String(take!(extracted_code))\nend\n```\nHere's a brief explanation of how the function works:\n\n* We use the regular expression `(```julia\\n([\\s\\S]*?)(\\n\\n|\\\\n\\n|\\\\n|$))` to find all Julia code blocks in the markdown document. The regular expression matches a block of text that is preceded by ````julia on a line by itself and followed by either two newlines, a backslash followed by a newline, or the end of the document. The backslash before the newline is used to escape it in the regular expression. The code block itself is captured in the second capturing group.\n* We initialize an empty `IOBuffer` to store the extracted code.\n* We loop through each code block found in the previous step and write the code to the `IOBuffer` using `write`. We also add a newline character after each code block except for the last one, which is handled separately using `eof`.\n* Finally, we convert the `IOBuffer` to a string using `String` and return it.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the code blocks in the markdown document are properly formatted and do not contain any syntax errors. If there are any issues with the formatting or syntax, the function may not work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[130,493],"elapsed":6.611845166,"_type":"aimessage"}]
