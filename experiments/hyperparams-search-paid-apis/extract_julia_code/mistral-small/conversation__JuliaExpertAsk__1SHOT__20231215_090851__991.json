Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that should accomplish what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = []\n    current_block = IOBuffer()\n\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            if !isempty(current_block)\n                push!(code_blocks, String(take!(current_block)))\n            end\n            current_block = IOBuffer()\n        elseif endswith(line, \"```\") && startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            nothing\n        else\n            write(current_block, line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    if !isempty(current_block)\n        push!(code_blocks, String(take!(current_block)))\n    end\n\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function iterates through each line of the markdown document, checking if the line starts with ```julia, which indicates the beginning of a code block. If a code block is found, it is added to an array of code blocks, and the current code block is reset. If the line ends with ``` and starts with ```julia, it is ignored, as this indicates the end of a code block. All other lines are added to the current code block. After processing all lines, the function joins the code blocks together with a newline and returns the resulting string.","status":200,"tokens":[130,338],"elapsed":4.55315775,"_type":"aimessage"}]
