Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that meets your requirements:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = eachmatch(r\"(```[jJ]ulia\\s?\\n([\\s\\S]*?)\\n```)\", md)\n    result = String[]\n    for cb in code_blocks\n        push!(result, cb.captures[2])\n    end\n    return join(result, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses the regular expression `(```[jJ]ulia\\s?\\n([\\s\\S]*?)\\n```)` to match Julia code blocks in the input markdown document. The regular expression matches blocks that start with `` `julia` or `` `Julia` (with an optional space after the backticks) and end with a line containing only three backticks. The code block content is captured in group 2, which we extract and store in the `result` array. Finally, we join the code blocks together with a newline character and return the result as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[130,246],"elapsed":3.282597292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
