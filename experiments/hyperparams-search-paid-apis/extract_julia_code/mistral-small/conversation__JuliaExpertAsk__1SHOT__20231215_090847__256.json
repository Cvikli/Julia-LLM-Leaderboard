Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that should accomplish what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = []\n    current_block = IOBuffer()\n\n    in_code_block = false\n\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if startswith(line, \"```\") && in_code_block\n            in_code_block = false\n            push!(code_blocks, String(take!(current_block)))\n            current_block = IOBuffer()\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if in_code_block\n            write(current_block, line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    # catch any remaining code block\n    if !eof(current_block)\n        push!(code_blocks, String(take!(current_block)))\n    end\n\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each line in the markdown document and checking if it is the beginning or end of a code block. If it is the beginning of a code block, it sets the `in_code_block` flag to `true` and continues to the next line. If it is the end of a code block, it writes the contents of the `current_block` buffer to an array of code blocks and resets the buffer. If it is in a code block, it writes the line to the `current_block` buffer. Finally, after the loop has finished, it checks if there is any remaining code in the `current_block` buffer and writes it to the array if necessary.\n\nThe function then joins all the code blocks in the array with a newline and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[130,418],"elapsed":5.6236185,"_type":"aimessage"}]
