Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that should accomplish what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = []\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    current_block = IOBuffer()\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            if isopen(current_block)\n                push!(code_blocks, take!(current_block))\n            end\n            current_block = IOBuffer()\n        elseif endswith(line, \"```\")\n            if isopen(current_block)\n                write(current_block, line[1:end-3])\n                push!(code_blocks, take!(current_block))\n                current_block = IOBuffer()\n            end\n        else\n            if isopen(current_block)\n                write(current_block, line, '\\n')\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    if isopen(current_block)\n        push!(code_blocks, take!(current_block))\n    end\n\n    return join(code_blocks, '\\n')\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating through each line of the input markdown string, and checking if it matches the start or end of a Julia code block. If it's the start of a code block, it creates a new `IOBuffer` to store the code in. If it's the end of a code block, it writes the code to an array of code blocks. Finally, it joins all the code blocks together with a newline and returns the resulting string.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the markdown string is well-formed and contains valid code fences. If there are any errors in the formatting, the function may not work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[130,413],"elapsed":5.592186291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
