Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that does what you described:\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    doc = Markdown.parse(md)\n    io = IOBuffer()\n    for node in doc.trees\n        if node.tag == \"code\" && node.info == \"julia\"\n            write(io, node.content)\n            write(io, '\\n')\n        end\n    end\n    return String(take!(io))\nend\n```\nThis function first parses the markdown document into a syntax tree using the `Markdown.parse` function. It then creates an `IOBuffer` to write the extracted code blocks to. It iterates over the syntax tree and looks for code nodes with the tag \"code\" and language information \"julia\". When it finds such a node, it writes its content to the `IOBuffer` followed by a newline character. Finally, it returns the resulting string.","status":200,"tokens":[130,220],"elapsed":3.000695792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
