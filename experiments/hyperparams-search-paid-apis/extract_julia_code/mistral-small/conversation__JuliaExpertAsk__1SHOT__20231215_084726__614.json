Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that should accomplish what you're asking for:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = []\n    block = IOBuffer()\n\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if startswith(line, \"`\")\n            if isempty(code_blocks) && position(block) > 1\n                pushfirst!(code_blocks, take!(block))\n                empty!(block)\n            end\n            continue\n        end\n        write(block, line)\n    end\n\n    if !isempty(code_blocks)\n        return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    else\n        return \"\"\n    end\nend\n```\nThe function works by iterating through each line in the markdown document. If a line starts with \"`\", it is a code fence and we add the current code block (if there is one) to the list of code blocks and start a new one. If a line does not start with \"`\", we add it to the current code block. Once we've gone through all the lines, we join the code blocks together with a newline and return the result. If there are no code blocks, we return an empty string.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the code blocks are written using triple backticks (```) instead of tildes (`~~~`). If you need to support both, you can modify the function to check for either.","status":200,"tokens":[130,330],"elapsed":4.528199916,"_type":"aimessage"}]
