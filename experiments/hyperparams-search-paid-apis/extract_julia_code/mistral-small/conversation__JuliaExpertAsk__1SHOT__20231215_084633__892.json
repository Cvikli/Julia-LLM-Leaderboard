Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that should accomplish what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = []\n    current_block = IOBuffer()\n\n    in_block = false\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_block = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && in_block\n            in_block = false\n            push!(code_blocks, String(take!(current_block)))\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if in_block\n            write(current_block, line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function iterates through each line of the input markdown document, checking if we are currently inside a Julia code block. If we are, it writes the line to a buffer. When we exit a code block, it adds the contents of the buffer to an array of code blocks. Finally, it joins the code blocks together with a newline and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[130,260],"elapsed":3.496133875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
