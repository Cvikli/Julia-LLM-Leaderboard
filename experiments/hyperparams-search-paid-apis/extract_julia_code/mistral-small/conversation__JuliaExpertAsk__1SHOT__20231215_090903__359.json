Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that should accomplish what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = []\n    current_block = IOBuffer()\n\n    in_code_block = false\n\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if startswith(line, \"```\") && in_code_block\n            in_code_block = false\n            push!(code_blocks, String(take!(current_block)))\n            current_block = IOBuffer()\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if in_code_block\n            write(current_block, line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating through each line in the input markdown document. If it encounters a line that starts with ```julia, it sets a flag indicating that it is inside a Julia code block. Any lines that come after this, up until it encounters another line that starts with ``` (indicating the end of the code block), are written to an `IOBuffer`. Once the end of the code block is reached, the contents of the `IOBuffer` are added to a list of code blocks. Finally, the function returns a string with all of the code blocks joined together with a newline character.","status":200,"tokens":[130,336],"elapsed":6.400473541,"_type":"aimessage"}]
