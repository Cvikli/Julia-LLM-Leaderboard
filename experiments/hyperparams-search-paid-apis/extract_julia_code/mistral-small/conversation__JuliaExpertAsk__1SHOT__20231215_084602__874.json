Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that should accomplish what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = []\n    current_block = IOBuffer()\n\n    in_code_block = false\n\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if startswith(line, \"`{\") && endswith(line, \"`}\")\n            if in_code_block\n                push!(code_blocks, take!(current_block))\n                in_code_block = false\n            end\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if in_code_block\n            write(current_block, line)\n        end\n\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n        end\n    end\n\n    if in_code_block\n        push!(code_blocks, take!(current_block))\n    end\n\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating through each line in the markdown document. If it encounters the start of a code block (```julia), it sets a flag `in_code_block` to true. While in a code block, it writes each line to an `IOBuffer` called `current_block`. When it encounters the end of a code block (```), it adds the contents of `current_block` to a vector of code blocks and resets `in_code_block` to false. Finally, it joins all the code blocks together with a newline and returns the result.\n\nNote that this function assumes that all code blocks are properly formatted with the correct number of backticks. If the markdown document contains malformed code blocks, the function may not work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[130,410],"elapsed":5.627577375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
