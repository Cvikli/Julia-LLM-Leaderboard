Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that should accomplish what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = eachmatch(r\"(```julia\\s*\\n.*?\\n```)\", md)\n    result = String[]\n    for cb in code_blocks\n        inner_code = cb.match[9:-1:3]\n        push!(result, inner_code)\n    end\n    return join(result, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the regular expression `(```julia\\s*\\n.*?\\n```)` to match Julia code blocks in the markdown document. The regular expression matches a block of text that starts with three backticks, followed by the word \"julia\" (optionally preceded by whitespace), followed by a newline, followed by any number of characters (captured as a group), followed by a newline, and finally followed by three backticks.\n\nFor each match, the function extracts the inner code block by slicing the matched string, and appends it to a result array.\n\nFinally, the function joins the result array into a single string with a newline separator, and returns it.","status":200,"tokens":[130,284],"elapsed":3.823417917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
