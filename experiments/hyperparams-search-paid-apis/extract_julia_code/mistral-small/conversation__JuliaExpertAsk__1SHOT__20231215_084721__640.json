Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that should accomplish what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    code_blocks = []\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    current_block = IOBuffer()\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            if isopen(current_block)\n                push!(code_blocks, take!(current_block))\n            end\n            current_block = IOBuffer()\n        elseif endswith(line, \"```\")\n            write(current_block, line[1:end-3])\n            push!(code_blocks, take!(current_block))\n            current_block = IOBuffer()\n        else\n            if isopen(current_block)\n                write(current_block, line)\n                write(current_block, '\\n')\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return String(join(code_blocks, \"\\n\"))\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating through each line in the markdown document, checking if the line is a code block fence. If it is, it reads the contents of the code block into an `IOBuffer`, and if it isn't, it writes the line to the current `IOBuffer` if one is open. At the end, it returns a string with all the code blocks concatenated together with a newline separating each block.","status":200,"tokens":[130,331],"elapsed":4.422858542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
