Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution to extract and join all Julia code blocks from a Markdown document:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Match triple-backticks followed by optional whitespace,\n    # any number of characters (including newlines) that don't include triple-backticks,\n    # and finally triple-backticks.\n    pattern = r\"(`{3}\\s*([^```\\n]*\\n?[^```]*)*`{3})\"\n    \n    # Find all matches and extract the code between the fences\n    code_blocks = matchall(pattern, md)\n    code = join([replace(strip(match.captures[2]), r\"\\n$\" => \"\") for match in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function first defines a regular expression pattern to match Julia code blocks in Markdown, which are enclosed in triple backticks (```). The pattern matches any number of characters between the opening and closing fences, including newlines, as long as they don't contain triple backticks themselves.\n\nThe function then uses `matchall` to find all occurrences of the pattern in the input Markdown string, and extracts the code between the fences using `strip` to remove any leading or trailing whitespace and newlines.\n\nFinally, the function joins all the code blocks together with a newline character, and returns the resulting string. Note that the function uses `replace` to remove any trailing newlines from each code block before joining them, using the regular expression `\\n$` to match a newline at the end of a string. This ensures that there are no extra newlines between the code blocks when they are joined together.","status":200,"tokens":[126,394],"elapsed":8.804564292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
