Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible solution:\n```\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    matches = eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md)\n    return join([match.captures[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `eachmatch` function from the `Regex` module to find all matches of the regular expression `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"` in the input markdown string. The regular expression matches a code fence for Julia code, which consists of three backticks followed by the word \"julia\" and a newline, followed by any number of lines of code, followed by three backticks and a newline. The `(.*?)` captures the code between the fences. The `join` function is then used to concatenate all the captured code blocks, separated by a newline.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.","status":200,"tokens":[126,224],"elapsed":37.135202458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
