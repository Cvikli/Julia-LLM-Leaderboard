Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of the function `extract_julia_code`:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Match Julia code blocks between triple backticks\n    code_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s, md)\n    # Remove the first and last line of each code block\n    cleaned_blocks = map(x -> strip(replace(x, r\"^```julia\\n|\\n```\"s => \"\")), code_blocks)\n    # Join the code blocks with newline separator\n    return join(cleaned_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\nThe function uses the Julia standard library `Regex` module to match Julia code blocks between triple backticks using a regular expression. The function then removes the first and last line of each code block (which contain the code fences), and joins the remaining code blocks together with a newline separator. The final result is returned as a string.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the code blocks are well-formed and do not contain any nested code blocks. If that assumption does not hold, a more sophisticated parsing algorithm may be required.","status":200,"tokens":[126,279],"elapsed":6.194615,"_type":"aimessage"}]
