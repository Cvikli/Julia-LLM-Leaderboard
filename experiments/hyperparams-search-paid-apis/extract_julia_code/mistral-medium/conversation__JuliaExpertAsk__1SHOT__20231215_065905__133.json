Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a brief and concise answer:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    code_blocks = eachmatch(r\"```julia[\\s\\S]*?```\", md)\n    extracted_code = join([strip(match.match) for match in code_blocks] |> collect, \"\\n\")\n    extracted_code[5:end-5]\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* The function `extract_julia_code` takes an abstract string `md` containing the markdown document.\n* The regular expression `r\"```julia[\\s\\S]*?```\"` matches all code blocks that start with ```julia and end with ```. The `[\\s\\S]*?` part matches any character (including newlines) between the start and end fences, non-greedily.\n* The `eachmatch` function returns an iterator that yields all matches of the regular expression in the input string.\n* The comprehension `[strip(match.match) for match in code_blocks]` creates an array of strings, where each string is a code block with the fences removed.\n* The `join` function concatenates all the code blocks into a single string, with a newline character `\\n` between each block.\n* Finally, the extracted code is sliced to remove the first and last five characters (i.e., the initial and final ```julia```) using the indexing expression `[5:end-5]`.\n\nConfidence: 95%.","status":200,"tokens":[126,351],"elapsed":7.783267208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
