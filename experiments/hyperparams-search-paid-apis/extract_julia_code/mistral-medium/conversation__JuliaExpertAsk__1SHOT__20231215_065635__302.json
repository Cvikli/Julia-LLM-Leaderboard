Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of the function `extract_julia_code`:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Match Julia code blocks using a regular expression\n    code_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s, md)\n    \n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline and remove the indentation\n    code = join(map(s -> replace(s, r\"^[ \\t]+\"m => \"\"), code_blocks), \"\\n\\n\")\n    \n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `Regex` module to match Julia code blocks in the markdown document. The regular expression `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s` matches any text that is enclosed between ```julia and ``` and includes any number of newline characters. The `matchall` function returns an array of all matches found in the document.\n\nThe function then uses the `join` function to concatenate all the code blocks together with a newline character in between. The `map` function is used to apply the `replace` function to each code block, which removes any leading whitespace (tabs or spaces) from each line of the code block.\n\nFinally, the function returns the resulting string containing all the extracted Julia code.","status":200,"tokens":[126,308],"elapsed":9.821965875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
