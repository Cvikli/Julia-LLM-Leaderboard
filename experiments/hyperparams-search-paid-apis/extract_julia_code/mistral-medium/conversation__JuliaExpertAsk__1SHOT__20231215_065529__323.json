Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of `extract_julia_code` function:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    code_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"sm, md)\n    return join(map(s -> strip(s), code_blocks), \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to match Julia code blocks in the markdown document. It then strips leading and trailing whitespace from each code block using the `strip` function and joins them together with a newline character using the `join` function. The `s` parameter in the `map` function is used to apply the `strip` function to each code block string. The `r\"...\"` syntax creates a raw string literal, which allows us to use backslashes in the regular expression without having to escape them. The `sm` flag after the regular expression is used to enable dotall mode (making the dot match newlines) and to make the regex engine treat the input string as single-line.","status":200,"tokens":[126,241],"elapsed":5.353730125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
