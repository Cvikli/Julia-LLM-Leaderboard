Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Regex pattern to match Julia code blocks\n    pattern = r\"(?s)```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"\n    \n    # Find all matches and extract the code blocks\n    matches = eachmatch(pattern, md)\n    code_blocks = [match.captures[1] for match in matches]\n    \n    # Join the code blocks with a newline and return the result\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `Regex` module to define a regular expression pattern that matches Julia code blocks in Markdown. The pattern matches any occurrence of the string \"```julia\" followed by a newline, then captures one or more characters (except for newlines) in a non-greedy fashion, and finally matches a closing \"```\" string followed by a newline.\n\nThe function then uses the `eachmatch` function to find all matches of this pattern in the input Markdown string, and extracts the captured code blocks using the `captures` property of each match object. The resulting code blocks are joined together with a newline using the `join` function, and the resulting string is returned.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input Markdown string is well-formed and contains valid Julia code blocks. If the input string is not well-formed or contains syntax errors, the function may not work correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[126,346],"elapsed":7.531165916,"_type":"aimessage"}]
