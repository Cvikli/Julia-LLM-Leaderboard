Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Match Julia code blocks between triple backticks\n    code_blocks = eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"sm, md)\n    \n    # Extract the code and join it with newlines\n    return join([match.captures[1] for match in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThe function uses the `eachmatch` function from the `Regex` module to find all Julia code blocks in the markdown document. The regular expression pattern `\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"sm` matches a sequence of one or more characters between triple backticks (````), where the first and last characters are newlines (`\\n`), and the language identifier is `julia`. The `s` and `m` flags are used to enable dot-matches-newline and multi-line mode, respectively.\n\nThe `captures` property of each match object contains a vector of captured strings, where the first element is the entire match and the second element is the first capture group (i.e., the code block itself). Therefore, the code blocks are extracted using `[match.captures[1] for match in code_blocks]`, which creates an array of code strings.\n\nFinally, the `join` function is used to concatenate the code strings with newlines, and the resulting string is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[126,348],"elapsed":7.751667458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
