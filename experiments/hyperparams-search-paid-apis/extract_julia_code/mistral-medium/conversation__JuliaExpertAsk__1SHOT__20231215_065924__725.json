Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a solution using regular expressions to extract the Julia code blocks from the markdown document:\n```\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Match triple backticks followed by any number of lines starting with 4 spaces or a tab, followed by triple backticks\n    pattern = r\"```\\n((?:    .*\\n|(?:\\t.*\\n))*)```\"ims\n    # Find all matches and extract the code blocks\n    code_blocks = [match.captures[1] for match in eachmatch(pattern, md)]\n    # Remove leading whitespace from each line and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    return join(map(s -> strip(replace(s, r\"^(    |^\\t)\"m => \"\")), code_blocks), \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `eachmatch` function from the `Regex` module to find all matches of the code block pattern in the markdown document. The pattern matches triple backticks followed by any number of lines that start with 4 spaces or a tab, followed by triple backticks. The `captures` property of each match object contains the captured code block, which is extracted and stored in the `code_blocks` array. The code blocks are then processed using the `map` function to remove leading whitespace from each line, and finally joined together with a newline to produce the final string.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the markdown document uses triple backticks to denote code blocks, and that the code blocks are indented with 4 spaces or a tab. If the markdown document uses a different syntax for code blocks, or if the code blocks are indented differently, then the regular expression pattern will need to be modified accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[126,390],"elapsed":8.647753583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
