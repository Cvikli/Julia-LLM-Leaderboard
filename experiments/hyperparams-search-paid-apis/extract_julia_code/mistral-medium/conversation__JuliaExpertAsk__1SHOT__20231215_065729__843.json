Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Match triple-backticked fences with Julia language identifier\n    code_blocks = eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md)\n    \n    # Extract code from each match and join with newlines\n    return join([match.captures[1] for match in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThe function uses the `Regex` module to search for Julia code blocks in the markdown document. The regular expression pattern `\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"` matches triple-backticked fences (````) followed by the word `julia`, a newline character (`\\n`), captures any number of characters (`.*?`) that are not a newline, and finally matches the closing fences and newline. The `eachmatch()` function returns an iterator that yields a `Match` object for each code block found. The `captures` property of the `Match` object contains the captured code as a string. The code from each match is extracted and joined together with a newline character (`\"\\n\"`). The resulting string is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[126,278],"elapsed":6.27602975,"_type":"aimessage"}]
