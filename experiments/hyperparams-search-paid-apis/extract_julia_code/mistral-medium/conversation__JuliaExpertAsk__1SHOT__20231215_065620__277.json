Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    doc = parse_document(md)\n    code_blocks = filter(is_code_block, doc.content)\n    julia_blocks = filter(x -> x.info == \"julia\", code_blocks)\n    code = join([strip(x.text) for x in julia_blocks], \"\\n\")\n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function first parses the markdown document into an abstract syntax tree (AST) using the `parse_document` function from the `Markdown` package. It then extracts all code blocks from the AST using the `is_code_block` function and filters out the ones that are not julia code blocks. Finally, it joins the remaining code blocks together with a newline character and returns the resulting string.\n\nNote: This implementation assumes that the julia code blocks are enclosed in triple backticks (```) with the language identifier (`julia`) immediately following the opening backticks. If your markdown document uses a different syntax for code blocks, you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[126,281],"elapsed":6.251884292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
