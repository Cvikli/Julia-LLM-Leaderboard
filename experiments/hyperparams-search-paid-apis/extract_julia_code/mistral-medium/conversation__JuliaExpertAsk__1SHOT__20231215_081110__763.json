Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution for extracting Julia code blocks from a markdown document:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Match Julia code blocks between triple backticks\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"is\n    matches = eachmatch(pattern, md)\n\n    # Extract code blocks and join them with newline characters\n    code_blocks = [match.captures[1] for match in matches]\n    julia_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\n\n    return julia_code\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `eachmatch` function from the `Regex` module to find all matches of the regular expression pattern `\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"` in the markdown document. The pattern matches any text that is enclosed between triple backticks (`````) and has the word `julia` immediately after the opening backticks. The `captures` property of each match object contains the text of the code block.\n\nThe function then uses a comprehension to extract the code blocks from the match objects and stores them in an array. Finally, it uses the `join` function to concatenate the code blocks into a single string, with two newline characters (`\\n\\n`) separating each block.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the input markdown document is a string. If the input is a file, you can read its contents into a string using the `read` function from the `Filesystem` module:\n```julia\nmd = read(\"example.md\", String)\njulia_code = extract_julia_code(md)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[126,387],"elapsed":43.734829459,"_type":"aimessage"}]
