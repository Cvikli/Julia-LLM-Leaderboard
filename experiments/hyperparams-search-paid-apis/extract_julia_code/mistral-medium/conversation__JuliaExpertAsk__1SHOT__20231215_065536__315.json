[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise. You're precise and answer only when you're confident in the high quality of your answer.","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Question\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that does what you're asking for:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Find all Julia code blocks using regex pattern\n    code_blocks = eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md)\n    \n    # Extract the code from each block and join them together with newline\n    code = join([match.captures[1] for match in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return code\nend\n```\nThe function uses the `Regex` module to find all Julia code blocks in the markdown document. The regular expression pattern `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"` matches any text that starts with ```julia`, followed by a newline, then any number of characters (non-greedily), and finally a newline and ``````. The `eachmatch()` function returns an iterator that yields a `Match` object for each match in the markdown document. The code from each block is extracted using the `captures` property of the `Match` object, which contains a vector of captured groups. The code from all blocks is then joined together with newline and returned as a string.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the input markdown document is a string and contains valid Julia code blocks. If the input is not a string or contains malformed code blocks, the function may not work correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[126,319],"elapsed":7.076596125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
