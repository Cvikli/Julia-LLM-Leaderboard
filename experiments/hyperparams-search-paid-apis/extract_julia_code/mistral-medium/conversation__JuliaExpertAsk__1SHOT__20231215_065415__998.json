Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Match Julia code blocks using regex\n    matches = eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md)\n\n    # Extract code blocks and join them with newlines\n    code_blocks = map(match -> match.captures[1], matches)\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\nThe function uses the `eachmatch` function from the `Regex` module to find all matches of Julia code blocks in the markdown document. The regular expression pattern `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"` matches any text that is enclosed between triple backticks and the word `julia`, followed by a newline, and ends with a newline before the closing triple backticks.\n\nThe `map` function is then used to extract the code blocks from the matches and remove the leading and trailing newlines. The resulting code blocks are joined together with double newlines to ensure that each code block is separated by a blank line.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input markdown document is a string and that the code blocks are well-formed. If the input is not a string or the code blocks are malformed, the function may not work correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[126,315],"elapsed":55.45180925,"_type":"aimessage"}]
