Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution using regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Match code blocks between triple backticks\n    matches = eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md)\n    # Extract the code without fences and join with newlines\n    return join([match.captures[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `eachmatch` function from the `Regex` module to find all matches of the regular expression pattern `\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"`, which matches triple backticks followed by the word \"julia\", a newline, any number of characters (non-greedily), and another newline followed by triple backticks. The `.captures` property of each match object contains a vector of captured substrings, of which we only care about the first element (i.e., the code block without fences). Finally, we use the `join` function to concatenate all the captured code blocks into a single string, with a newline character in between each block.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the markdown document is well-formed and that there are no nested code blocks. If these assumptions do not hold, a more robust parsing approach may be necessary.","status":200,"tokens":[126,300],"elapsed":10.482619375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
