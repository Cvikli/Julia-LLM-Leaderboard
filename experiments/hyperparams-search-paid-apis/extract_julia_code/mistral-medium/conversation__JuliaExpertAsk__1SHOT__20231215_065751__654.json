Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution using regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    # Match triple-backtick fenced Julia code blocks and capture the code inside\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"is\n    matches = eachmatch(pattern, md)\n\n    # Extract the code from each match and join them with a newline\n    code_blocks = [match.captures[1] for match in matches]\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `eachmatch` function from the `Regex` module to find all occurrences of the regular expression pattern in the markdown document. The pattern matches any occurrence of triple-backtick fenced code blocks that are written in the Julia language, and captures the code inside the block. The captured code blocks are then extracted from each match using the `captures` property, and finally joined together with a newline character to form a single string.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the markdown document uses the standard syntax for fenced code blocks, and that all Julia code blocks are triple-backticked and labeled as `julia`. If the document uses a different syntax or labeling convention, the regular expression pattern may need to be modified accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[126,303],"elapsed":6.825560625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
