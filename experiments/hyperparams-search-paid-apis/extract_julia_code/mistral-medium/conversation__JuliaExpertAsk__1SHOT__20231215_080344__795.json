Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution for the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Match Julia code blocks using regular expressions\n    matches = eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md)\n\n    # Extract the code from each match and join them with newlines\n    code_blocks = [match.captures[1] for match in matches]\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `eachmatch` function from the `Regex` module to find all occurrences of Julia code blocks in the markdown document. It then extracts the code from each match using the `captures` property and joins them together with newlines using the `join` function.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the code fences are written as triple backticks followed by the word \"julia\", followed by a newline, and that the code blocks end with a newline followed by triple backticks. If your markdown document uses a different syntax for code fences, you may need to modify the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[126,265],"elapsed":5.896014208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
