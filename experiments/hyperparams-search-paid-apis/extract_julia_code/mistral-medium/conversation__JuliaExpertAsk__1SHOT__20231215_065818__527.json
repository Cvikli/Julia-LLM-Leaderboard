Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    matches = eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md)\n    return join([match.captures[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThe function uses a regular expression to match Julia code blocks in the markdown document. The regular expression `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"` matches any text that starts with three backticks followed by the word \"julia\", then any number of characters (non-greedily) until the next occurrence of three backticks. The match is captured in a tuple, and the first element of the tuple contains the Julia code without the fences.\n\nThe `eachmatch` function is used to iterate over all matches in the markdown document. For each match, the Julia code is extracted using the `captures` property, and the resulting strings are joined together with a newline character using the `join` function.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the markdown document is a single string and that Julia code blocks are delimited using triple backticks. If your markdown document is split across multiple strings or uses a different code fence syntax, you may need to modify the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[126,297],"elapsed":11.74032175,"_type":"aimessage"}]
