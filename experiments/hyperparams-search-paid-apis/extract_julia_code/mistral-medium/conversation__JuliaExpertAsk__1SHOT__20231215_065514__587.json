Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible solution using regular expressions to extract the Julia code blocks:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Match triple-backticked Julia code blocks\n    matches = eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s, md)\n    # Extract the code and join with newlines\n    return join([match.captures[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `eachmatch` function from the ` Regex` module to find all matches of the regular expression `\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s` in the input markdown string. The regular expression matches triple-backticked Julia code blocks, where `.*?` matches any character (except a newline) non-greedily. The captured group `(.*?)` corresponds to the Julia code itself. The `join` function is then used to concatenate all the extracted code blocks with newline characters in between.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the markdown document only contains Julia code blocks and no other code blocks with different languages. If the document contains multiple languages, a more sophisticated parsing approach may be needed.","status":200,"tokens":[126,272],"elapsed":6.050838625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
