Here's how you can define the `FloatWithUnits` struct and implement its `show` method to concatenate the value and unit:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::AbstractString\nend\n\nimport Base.show\n\nfunction show(io::IO, x::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, x.value, \" \", x.unit)\nend\n```\n\nYou can then create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and see the desired output:\n\n```julia\nx = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nshow(x)  # Output: 1.8 meters\n```\n\nNote that we've defined the `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct inside the `Base` module so that it becomes part of the default behavior for displaying instances of this struct.","status":200,"tokens":[105,175],"elapsed":4.182721917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
