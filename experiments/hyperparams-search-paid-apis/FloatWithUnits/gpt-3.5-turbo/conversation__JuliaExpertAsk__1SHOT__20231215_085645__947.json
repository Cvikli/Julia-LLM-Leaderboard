[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise.

Here is the definition of the `FloatWithUnits` struct along with the `show` method:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nBase.show(io::IO, x::FloatWithUnits) = print(io, string(x.value, \" \", x.unit))\n```\n\nWith this implementation, when you call `show` on an instance of `FloatWithUnits`, it will print the value and unit separated by a space. For example:\n\n```julia\njulia> x = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nFloatWithUnits(1.8 meters)\n\njulia> show(x)\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nI hope this helps!","status":200,"tokens":[105,153],"elapsed":3.673156125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
