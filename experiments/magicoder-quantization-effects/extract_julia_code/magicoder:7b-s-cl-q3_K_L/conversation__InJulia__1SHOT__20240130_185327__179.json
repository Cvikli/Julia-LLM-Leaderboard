The `re.findall` method returns all matches of the provided regular expression, and the `re.DOTALL` flag makes it so `.` can match any character including newlines. The `\\n(.*?)\\n` part of the regex is used to match the start and end of each code block (i.e., ```julia) and captures everything in between as a group.\n\nIf there are multiple code blocks, this function will join them together with newline characters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,256],"elapsed":2.041977346,"_type":"aimessage"}]
