[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the function `extract_julia_code`.\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks and split them by newline\n    codes = split(md, \"```\")\n    \n    # Initialize an empty string to store the final result\n    final_code = \"\"\n  \n    # Loop through each code block\n    for code in codes[2:end]\n        # Remove code fences and append with a newline \n        final_code *= code[2:end-1]*\"\\n\"\n    end\n    \n    return final_code\nend\n```\nThis function works by first splitting the input string `md` at each occurrence of ````. This gives an array of strings, where the second element is the first part of the markdown document, and all subsequent elements are individual code blocks. Each block is then processed to remove its surrounding fences (the first and last characters) and appended with a newline character to `final_code`, which is returned as the result.\n\nThis function does not handle cases where there might be more than one block of code separated by other content, it just assumes that all blocks are isolated. If you need to handle such cases, the solution would become more complex because you would have to identify the language for each block and decide how to handle it (concatenate or execute).","status":200,"tokens":[0,307],"elapsed":2.490525021,"_type":"aimessage"}]
