[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can implement this function using Julia's regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regex pattern to match a code block surrounded by ``` (fences) and any language specification\n    fence = r\"```(?:\\n|.)*?\\n.*?(?=\\n```)\"s\n    \n    # Remove code blocks from markdown, keep only the remaining content\n    md_without_code = replace(md, fence => \"\")\n\n    # Concatenate all matched code blocks into a single string with newline separators\n    joined_code_blocks = join([match.match for match in eachmatch(fence, md)], \"\\n\\n\")\n    \n    return md_without_code * joined_code_blocks\nend\n```\nThis function `extract_julia_code` takes a string that represents the markdown content and removes all code blocks from it. It then concatenates all found Julia language code blocks into one string separated by newline characters. The resulting string includes all remaining text after removing code blocks, followed by the code blocks themselves, all joined together.\n\nNote: The regular expression used for matching fences is very basic and might not work correctly if your markdown has complex fencing patterns or if there are nested fenced areas. If you need to handle such cases properly, more advanced methods like parsing the entire markdown document as a tree structure will be needed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,325],"elapsed":2.736303574,"_type":"aimessage"}]
