Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```python\nimport re\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md: str) -> str:\n    # Extracting all code blocks using regular expressions\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```(.*?)```', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # Removing the fences ( ``` ) from each block and joining them with a newline\n    cleaned_code = \"\\n\".join([block.strip().lstrip(\"julia\") for block in code_blocks])\n\n    return cleaned_code\n```\nThis function first extracts all the code blocks using regular expressions. The `re.findall` method returns all non-overlapping matches of pattern in string, as a list of strings. We are using the `re.DOTALL` flag to make `.` match any character at all, including a newline.\n\nThen it removes the fences ( ``` ) from each block and joins them together with a newline. The `lstrip(\"julia\")` is used to remove the language hint \"julia\" from the code blocks if it exists.\n\nFinally, it returns this string of joined cleaned code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[0,266],"elapsed":2.162040953,"_type":"aimessage"}]
