Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this task using regular expressions in Python. Here's how you might define the function `extract_julia_code`:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```(?:julia|julia-repl)\\n(.*?)```', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    if len(code_blocks) > 1:\n        return \"\\n\".join(code_blocks)\n    elif code_blocks:\n        return code_blocks[0]\n    else:\n        return \"\"\n```\nThis function uses the `re.findall` method to find all occurrences of the regular expression `r'```(?:julia|julia-repl)\\n(.*?)```'`. This pattern matches strings that start with four backticks (```), followed by \"julia\" or \"julia-repl\", and end with another set of four backticks (```\\n.*```). The `re.DOTALL` flag tells Python to match any characters, including newlines.\n\nIf there are multiple code blocks in the input string `md`, the function joins them together with newline characters. If there is only one block, it returns the block as a string. If no blocks are found, the function returns an empty string.\n\nYou can test this function using your provided example:\n\n```python\nprint(extract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\\nprintln(\"hello world\")\\n```\"\"\"))  # \"println(\\\"hello world\\\")\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,371],"elapsed":3.013860445,"_type":"aimessage"}]
