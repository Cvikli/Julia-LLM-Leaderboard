Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can accomplish this task by using regular expressions in Python. Here's a simple function `extract_julia_code` that will do what you need:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # Find all code blocks\n    matches = re.findall(r'```(.*?)```', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # If no matches found return None\n    if not matches: \n        return None\n\n    # Remove code fences and join them with a newline\n    joined_code = '\\n'.join([match.strip() for match in matches])\n    \n    return joined_code\n```\nThis function first finds all matches of the regular expression that matches any code block (i.e., anything between three backticks). It then removes the fences from each match, and joins them together with a newline character. If no matches are found (i.e., there's no Julia language code in your markdown document), it returns None.\n\nYou can call this function like so:\n\n```python\n# Assuming that md is your markdown string\ncode = extract_julia_code(md)\nprint(code)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,271],"elapsed":2.21184903,"_type":"aimessage"}]
