[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might implement this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    code_blocks = filter(x -> startswith(x, \"```\") && endswith(x, \"```\"), split(md, '\\n'))\n    joined_code_blocks = join(code_blocks[2:end], \"\\n\") # remove fences and join blocks\n    return String(joined_code_blocks)\nend\n``` \n\nThis function works by splitting the input string `md` on newline characters to get a vector of lines. It then filters out any line that is not a Julia code block, i.e., it doesn't start with \"```\" and ends with \"```. Then, it joins all of the remaining lines together (except for the first one, which is just the fence) using newlines. The function finally converts this string to an `AbstractString` before returning it.\n  \nPlease note that this will remove all code blocks from the input markdown, not just those inside \"```\" fences or between ``` and ``` tags. If you want to preserve these tags but still extract the contained code, you would need a more complex function that can handle these nested structures.","status":200,"tokens":[0,281],"elapsed":2.337540466,"_type":"aimessage"}]
