Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of the problem using regular expressions in Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    code_blocks = re.findall(\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, re.DOTALL)  # find all julia blocks\n    \n    if len(code_blocks) == 0:  # if no julia code found, return empty string\n        return \"\"\n\n    joined_code = \"\\n\".join(code_blocks)  # join the blocks with a newline\n    return joined_code\n```\nThis function uses a regular expression to find all occurrences of code blocks surrounded by three backticks (`) and 'julia' inside them. It then joins these code blocks together with newlines in between, effectively removing the code fences. If no julia code is found, it returns an empty string.\n\nThis function assumes that the markdown document `md` contains exactly one code block for each language (other languages can be used within a julia code block). It does not handle nested code blocks or multiple julia code blocks on the same line. You may need to adjust this according to your specific requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,269],"elapsed":2.157968301,"_type":"aimessage"}]
