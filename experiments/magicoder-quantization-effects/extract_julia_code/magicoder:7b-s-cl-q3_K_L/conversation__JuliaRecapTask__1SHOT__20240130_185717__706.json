[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, we can use regular expressions (RegEx) to find and extract the Julia code from markdown documents. For this task, I'll use the `replace` function to replace the fences (````julia`) around the Julia blocks with nothing, then join all the lines together. Here is an example implementation of a function that can do that:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Matches 4 or more consecutive backticks (which are the markdown syntax for code fences in Julia).\n    pattern = r\"```\"\n    return replace(replace(md, pattern => \"\"), \"`\" => \"\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function will remove all the markdown code fence syntax from the input string `md`, leaving only the actual Julia code. You can then run this function on your markdown document to extract and combine the code blocks into a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,204],"elapsed":1.69363856,"_type":"aimessage"}]
