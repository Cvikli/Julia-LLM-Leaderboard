[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can create this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    code_blocks = []\n    block = \"\"\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, '`' ) && endswith(line, '`')\n            push!(code_blocks, block)\n            block = \"\"\n        elseif !startswith(line, \"```\") \n            block *= line\n        end\n    end\n    join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a string `md` which represents the markdown document with julia code blocks. It splits the input string into lines and iterates over these lines. If it finds a line that starts and ends with backticks (`), it knows this is a new code block, so it appends the current code block to the list of code blocks and resets `block`. If it doesn't find any lines that start and end with backticks, it simply concatenates the current line into the current code block. After going through all the lines, it joins all the code blocks together using a newline separator and returns the result. \n\nPlease note that this function does not handle nested code blocks or code blocks with different delimiters. You might want to adjust it according to your specific needs.","status":200,"tokens":[0,309],"elapsed":2.460362458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
