[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use regular expressions to extract the code blocks from your markdown document and then join them together with a newline. Here is a possible implementation of `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, seed=1))\n    codes = join.(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    return join(codes, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `collect` function to convert each match into a string. The regular expression `r\"```julia(.+?)```\" captures all code blocks with language specified as Julia (note that you can add more languages if needed). \n\nThe function then joins all these strings together with a newline character using the `join` function. This will create one long string, where each block of Julia code is separated by two newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,220],"elapsed":1.767778709,"_type":"aimessage"}]
