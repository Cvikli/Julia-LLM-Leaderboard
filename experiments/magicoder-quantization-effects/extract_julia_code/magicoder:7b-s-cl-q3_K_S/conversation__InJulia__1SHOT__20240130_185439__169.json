It then joins them together with a newline character. Note that the re.DOTALL flag is used so that the dot (.) matches any character, including newlines.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```python\nmd = \"\"\"\nThis is some text. \n\n```julia\nfunction f(x)\n   return x + 1\nend\n```\n\nAnother piece of text.\n\n```julia\nfor i in 1:10\n    println(i)\nend\n```\n\"\"\"\n\nprint(extract_julia_code(md))\n```\n\nThis will print:\n\n```julia\nfunction f(x)\n   return x + 1\nend\n\nfor i in 1:10\n    println(i)\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,354],"elapsed":2.772977499,"_type":"aimessage"}]
