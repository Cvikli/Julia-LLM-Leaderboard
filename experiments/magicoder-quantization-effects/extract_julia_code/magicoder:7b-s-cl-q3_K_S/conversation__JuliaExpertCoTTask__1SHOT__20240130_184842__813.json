[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Python function that extracts and joins the code blocks:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```julia\\n(.*?)```', md, re.DOTALL)  # find all code blocks using regex\n    \n    if len(code_blocks) > 1:  # if there are multiple code blocks\n        return '\\n'.join(code_blocks)  \n    else:   # if there is only one block or no block, return the block as it is\n        return code_blocks[0] if code_blocks else \"\"\n```\nIn this function we use `re.findall()` to find all occurrences of the pattern in the markdown string that matches a Julia code block (a piece of code between ```julia and ```). The `.` before `*` in `(.*?)` makes the quantifier non-greedy, i.e., it will match as few characters as possible. Finally, we join all the found code blocks together with newline characters.\n\nThe function will return a string that represents the extracted Julia code. If there are no matching blocks or only one block, it returns this single block (as a string). The returned string includes newline characters for each line in the original markdown document. \n\nIf you want to remove the newline characters from the final result, you can use another function like so:\n```python\ndef extract_and_clean(md):\n    code = extract_julia_code(md)\n    return code.replace('\\n', ' ') if '\\n' in code else code  # if there are newlines, replace them with a space, otherwise leave it as is\n```","status":200,"tokens":[254,389],"elapsed":8.544075037,"_type":"aimessage"}]
