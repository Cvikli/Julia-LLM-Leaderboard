Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of your requested functionality in Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # Find all code blocks\n    block_match = re.findall(r'```(.*?)\\n((?:.*\\n*)*?)```', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    if not block_match:\n        return \"\"\n\n    # Concatenate the found blocks without fences\n    result = ''\n    for match in block_match:\n        language, code = match\n        if language.strip().lower() == \"julia\":\n            result += '\\n' + code.replace('```', '')\n    \n    return result\n```\nIn this implementation, we first find all the code blocks in the markdown document using a regular expression that matches ```...``` enclosed sections and extracts both language and actual code. We then iterate over these blocks and add them to our result string after removing fences (by replacing '```').\n\nNote: This function assumes there is at least one julia-language block in the markdown document. If you want to return an empty string when no julia blocks are found, you can modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,274],"elapsed":2.154148551,"_type":"aimessage"}]
