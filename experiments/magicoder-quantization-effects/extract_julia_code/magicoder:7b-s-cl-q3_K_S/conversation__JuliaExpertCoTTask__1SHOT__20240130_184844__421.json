Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this task using Python's `re` library to handle regular expressions:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(markdown):\n    pattern = r'```julia(.*?)```' # a block starting with four backticks\n    \n    matches = [m.group(1) for m in re.finditer(pattern, markdown, re.DOTALL)]\n    \n    code_blocks = [\"\".join([x.strip() for x in match.split(\"\\n\")]) for match in matches]\n    \n    return \"\\n\\n\".join(code_blocks)\n\n# Testing with the provided example\nprint(extract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\"))\n```\n\nThis function works by first finding all matches of the code block pattern (everything between ``` and ```), then it removes any leading or trailing whitespace from each line in the match, and finally it joins all lines together with newline characters. The `.group(1)` is used to get everything that's inside the first set of backticks (````match.split(\"\\n\")```).","status":200,"tokens":[0,270],"elapsed":2.14057245,"_type":"aimessage"}]
