[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use a combination of regular expressions to extract the code blocks from the markdown and then join them into one string. Here is a possible solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regular expression for finding code blocks in markdown\n    pattern = r\"```(.*?\\n)(.*?)\\n```\"s\n    \n    # Find all matches and join them into one string\n    result = String[]\n    for m in eachmatch(pattern, md)\n        append!(result, replace(m.captures[2], \"\\n\" => \" \"; flags=re.I))  # remove newline and replace with space\n    end\n    \n    return join(result, '\\n')  # Join the code blocks into one string with newlines between each block\nend\n```\nThis function extracts all the code blocks from the markdown and removes the code fences. It assumes that all code blocks in the markdown use ``` for code fences. The `replace(m.captures[2], \"\\n\" => \" \"; flags=re.I)` is used to remove newline characters (`\\n`) and replace them with a space.\n  \nPlease note that this solution does not handle nested or special code blocks. If your markdown file includes nested fenced code blocks, the task becomes much more complicated and may require additional logic to properly extract those as well. \n\nAlso remember that markdown syntax allows for some flexibility in how it handles code blocks. For example, it might accept more than one line of code per block, or it might use different characters like `~~~` to denote code fences. Therefore, if you're dealing with a very specific markdown file format, additional logic may be needed to handle those variations.","status":200,"tokens":[0,389],"elapsed":3.190267566,"_type":"aimessage"}]
