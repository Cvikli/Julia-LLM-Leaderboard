[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The `extract_julia_code` function will be written in Julia itself, and we'll use regular expressions to find code blocks, discard fences (if present), and join all found codes. Here is the implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Base64: b64decode\nimport Markdown: parse_blocks\n\n# Define function extract_julia_code\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Parse markdown into blocks\n    blocks = parse_blocks(b64decode(md)) \n    \n    # Initialize empty string for code\n    code = \"\"\n\n    # Loop through each block and check if it's a julia block\n    for block in blocks\n        if startswith(lowercase(block.args[1]), \"julia\")\n            # Remove the first line (\"## Julia\") to get the actual code\n            code = block.content[2:end] \n            \n            # If there are multiple julia blocks, join them with newline\n            if !isempty(code) && startswith(lowercase(block.args[1]), \"julia\")\n                code *= \"\\n\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return code\nend\n```\n\nPlease note that this function assumes all the `## Julia` blocks are at the same indentation level, and will join them together with newline if there're multiple. If you have more specific rules or conditions for joining/discarding blocks, additional features might need to be added. \n\nRemember, the markdown is expected to be Base64 encoded before it arrives here, so you may want to add error handling as needed (like if decoding fails).","status":200,"tokens":[0,385],"elapsed":3.158875267,"_type":"aimessage"}]
