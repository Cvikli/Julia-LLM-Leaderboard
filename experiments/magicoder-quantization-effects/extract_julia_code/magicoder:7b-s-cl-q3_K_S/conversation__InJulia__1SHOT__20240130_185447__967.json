[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Python solution of your problem:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # find all code blocks in md and replace them with nothing, effectively removing them\n    md = re.sub(r'```(?:julia|)\\n(.*?)\\n```' , \"\", md, flags=re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # find the remaining standalone lines of code and remove the newline at the end if there is one\n    md_list = [line.strip() for line in md.split('\\n')]\n    return \"\\n\".join(md_list)\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to match the markdown code blocks and then replace them with nothing, effectively removing them from the input `md`. The `.replace()` method is used instead of using a regex to remove the remaining standalone lines of code. It splits the string into lines using the `\\n` newline character as a delimiter, strips any leading or trailing whitespace from each line, and then joins them back together with newline characters in between. \n\nRemember that this function will work assuming you have markdown code blocks only on their own separate lines (without other content on those lines). If your input includes code fences within the middle of sentences or paragraphs, it may not work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[0,290],"elapsed":2.286589684,"_type":"aimessage"}]
