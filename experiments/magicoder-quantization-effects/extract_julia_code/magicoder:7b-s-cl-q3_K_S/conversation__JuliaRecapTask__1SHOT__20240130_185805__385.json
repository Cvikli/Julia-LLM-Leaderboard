[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is an example of how you might define this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    \n    code_lines = String[]\n    in_codeblock = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```\") && !in_codeblock\n            in_codeblock = true\n        elseif in_codeblock && endswith(line, \"```\")\n            in_codeblock = false\n        elseif in_codeblock \n            push!(code_lines, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    code = join(code_lines, '\\n')\n    return code\nend\n```\n\nThis function processes the markdown document line by line. When it encounters a line that starts and ends with ``` (indicating a code block), it toggles `in_codeblock`. If `in_codeblock` is true, it adds the line to `code_lines`, and when it's false again, it joins all of these lines together into a single string of code.\n\nKeep in mind that this function assumes each code block starts and ends with ``` but does not handle code fences within the blocks (as the language markdown itself doesn't support nested fenced code sections). If your task description allows for this, you might need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[422,318],"elapsed":7.900480882,"_type":"aimessage"}]
