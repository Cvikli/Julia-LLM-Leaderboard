[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String.

Here is how you can implement it:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\nusing Parsers\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    blocks = split(md, \"\\n\\n\")  # Split into blocks by double line breaks\n    code = \"\"\n    for block in blocks\n        if match(r\"^```(.*?)\\n(.*?)\\n```\", block) !== nothing\n            # It's a code block\n            _, language, content = split(block, \"\\n\")\n            if strip(language) == \"julia\"\n                code *= content * \"\\n\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the markdown document into blocks. Then it goes through each block and checks whether it's a Julia code block. If it is, it extracts the content of the code block and appends it to `code`. Finally, it returns `code` as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,236],"elapsed":1.843790201,"_type":"aimessage"}]
