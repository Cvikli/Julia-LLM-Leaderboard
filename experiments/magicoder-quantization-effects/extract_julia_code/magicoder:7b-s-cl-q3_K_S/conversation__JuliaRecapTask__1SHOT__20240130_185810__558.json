[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The function `extract_julia_code` will extract all the code blocks from the markdown document, remove the code fences and join them together with a newline. Here's how you can implement it in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    blocks = split(md, \"```\")\n    result = \"\"\n    for block in blocks\n        if block != \"\" && !occursin(\"julia\", block)\n            block_lines = split(block, \"\\n\")\n            block_without_codefence = join(block_lines[2:end], \"\\n\")\n            result *= block_without_codefence * (block != \"\" ? \"\\n\" : \"\")\n        end\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\nIn this function, we first split the markdown document into blocks using \"```\" as a delimiter. For each code block, if it's not an empty string and doesn't contain 'julia', then we split the lines of the code block again to remove the language name line (i.e., the second line) and join them together with newline characters. We add these joined strings together in the result variable. \n\nWe return this result after processing all the blocks. Note that if a block is not 'julia', we simply ignore it as per the problem requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,306],"elapsed":2.497053771,"_type":"aimessage"}]
