[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise. You're precise and answer only when you're confident in the high quality of your answer.","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Question\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Python implementation of your request:\n\n```python\nimport re\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md: str) -> str:\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```(?:julia|.*?)\\n(.*?)```', md, re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE)\n    if len(code_blocks) > 1:\n        return '\\n'.join(code_blocks)\n    elif code_blocks:\n        return code_blocks[0]\n    else:\n        return \"\"\n```\n\nThis function uses the regular expression `r'```(?:julia|.*?)\\n(.*?)```' to extract all the code blocks from the markdown document. The parameter `re.DOTALL` allows `.` in the pattern to match any character, including newlines. The parameter `re.MULTILINE` allows `^` and `$` to match the start or end of each line, respectively.\n\nThen it checks if there are more than one code blocks, if so, it joins them with newline. If there's only one block or no block at all it returns the extracted code block directly. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that your markdown document is properly formatted and follows the convention of using three backticks (```) to encapsulate a code block in Julia, which is not the default convention for Markdown syntax.","status":200,"tokens":[0,326],"elapsed":2.557339932,"_type":"aimessage"}]
