[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem using Python's `re` library to find markdown code fences and the built-in `str.join()` method to concatenate all the blocks of code together with a newline in between each block.\n\nHere is a simple example:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(markdown):\n    # Find all markdown code fences\n    matches = re.findall(r'```(.*?)\\n(.*?)\\n```', markdown, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # Join the blocks of code together with a newline in between each block\n    combined_code = '\\n'.join([match[1] for match in matches])\n    \n    return combined_code\n```\nPlease replace `markdown` with your actual input string. This function will extract all julia language code blocks from the markdown document and join them together, removing any extra newline characters between blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[0,209],"elapsed":1.726780477,"_type":"aimessage"}]
