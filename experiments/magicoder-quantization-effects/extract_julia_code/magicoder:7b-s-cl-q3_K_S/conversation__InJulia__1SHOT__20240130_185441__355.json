The `re.DOTALL` flag makes the dot (.) in the regular expression match any character, including a newline. \n\nAfter finding all the code blocks, it joins them together with a newline between each block using the `join` method on the list of code blocks. Finally, it strips any leading or trailing white space from the resulting string before returning it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,205],"elapsed":1.597777386,"_type":"aimessage"}]
