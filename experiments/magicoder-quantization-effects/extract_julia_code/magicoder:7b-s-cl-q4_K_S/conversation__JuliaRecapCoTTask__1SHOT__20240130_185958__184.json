[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can extract all the Julia code from the markdown document:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n') # Split string into lines\n    in_block = false\n    block_lines = String[]\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, '```julia')\n            in_block = true\n        elseif endswith(line, '```') && in_block\n            in_block = false\n            \n            # Join and remove fences from each block\n            code_str = join(block_lines, '\\n')\n            code_str = replace(code_str, r\"^```julia\\n|```$\" => \"\")\n\n            append!(block_lines, code_str)\n        elseif in_block\n            # Append line to current block\n            push!(block_lines, line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return join(block_lines, '\\n')\nend\n```\n\nThis function assumes that the input `md` is a string containing a markdown document. It first splits the document into lines and then iterates over each line. If it encounters a line starting with '```julia', it starts recording the block of code; if it encounters a line ending with '```' (which marks the end of a code block), it stops recording that block of code. It appends each block to `block_lines` and also removes the fences from each block. In the end, it joins all the recorded blocks into one string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,363],"elapsed":2.853469611,"_type":"aimessage"}]
