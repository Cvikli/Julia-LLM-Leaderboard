[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem, we'll use the `Regex` module in Julia to find and extract the code blocks from markdown files. We'll split each block by lines and join them together with a newline character.\n\nHere is an example of how you could define such function:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\nusing REPL.REPLCompletions: module_string\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    blocks = split(md, r\"\\n```julia\")[2:end] # Split markdown string by ```julia code blocks and remove first element (empty)\n    joined_blocks = join([split(block, \"\\n\") for block in blocks], \"\\n\\n\") # Join code blocks with double newlines\n    code = replace(joined_blocks, \"`\" => \"\") # Remove backticks\n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function splits the markdown string into blocks by the `r\"\\n```julia\"` pattern (splitting by newline followed by ```julia), then joins these blocks together with two newlines in between. It then removes any remaining backticks from the resulting string. \n\nPlease note that this function doesn't take care of all edge cases. For instance, it will not properly handle code blocks without a terminating newline or trailing whitespace. However, for most common use-cases, this should work fine.","status":200,"tokens":[0,316],"elapsed":2.481961555,"_type":"aimessage"}]
