Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function named `extract_julia_code` that will accomplish this task:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Split the markdown by newline\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    \n    # Initialize variables to keep track of whether we are in a code block and the current code string\n    in_codeblock, code_string = false, \"\"\n\n    # Loop through each line\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, '`'^2) && endswith(line, '`'^2)\n            # If this is a markdown code block, switch the state\n            in_codeblock = !in_codeblock \n        elseif in_codeblock && startswith(line, '`'^3) && endswith(line, '`'^3)\n            # If it's a julia code block, append to the current string and switch off the state\n            in_codeblock = false\n            append!(code_string, \"\\n\") \n        elseif in_codeblock && startswith(line, \"`\") == false && endswith(line, \"`\") == false\n            # If it's a line within the code block and not a markdown code block, append to the current string\n            append!(code_string, \"\\n\") \n            append!(code_string, line[3:end-1])\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return code_string\nend\n```\nThis function loops through each line of the markdown document. If a line starts and ends with ` (two or three times), it is considered a markdown code block which will be ignored as per the problem statement. If it's a julia code block, it will append to the current string (`code_string`) separated by a newline `\\n`. The final `code_string` would be the combined code blocks in the markdown document.","status":200,"tokens":[0,430],"elapsed":3.374821615,"_type":"aimessage"}]
