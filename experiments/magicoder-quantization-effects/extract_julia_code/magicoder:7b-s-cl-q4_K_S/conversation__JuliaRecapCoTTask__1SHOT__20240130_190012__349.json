[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible solution using Julia's Regex:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\nusing RegularExpressions\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia(.*?)```\", md, seperator= \"\\n\"))\n    code_blocks = [match[1] for match in blocks]\n    cleaned_codes = replace.(code_blocks, r\"^```julia\\n|```$\"=>\"\")  # removing ```julia and ```\n    joined_code = join(cleaned_codes, \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by extracting all the Julia code blocks from the markdown document `md` using regex. It then removes the start and end code fences (````julia\\n and ````) for each block of code using replace in the join step. Finally, it returns a single string with all code joined together with newlines.\n\nThis function assumes that there are no other backticks (`) in your code, as this would create an incorrect match. If you have such cases, you will need to adjust the regex accordingly. Also, be aware that the performance of this function can degrade significantly for larger documents, because it needs to iterate over all matches and replace them individually.\n \nPlease note: `Markdown` package is a part of Julia's standard library, which is used in parsing markdown documents and `RegularExpressions` package is also part of Julia's standard library which provides regular expression matching operations.","status":200,"tokens":[0,351],"elapsed":2.711889376,"_type":"aimessage"}]
