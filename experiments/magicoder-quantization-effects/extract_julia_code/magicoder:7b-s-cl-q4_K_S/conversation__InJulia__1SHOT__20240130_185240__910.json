Then we filter out only those elements that are `CodeBlock`. We use the `mapreduce` function to join all code blocks together with newline characters. The result is a single string containing all the code in the markdown document, with code fences removed.\n\nTo test this function you can:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n```julia-repl\n1 + 1\n```\n\n```julia-repl\n2 * 2\n```\n\"\"\"\n\nprintln(extract_julia_code(md))\n# Outputs: \"1 + 1\\n2 * 2\\n\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[122,322],"elapsed":4.50001768,"_type":"aimessage"}]
