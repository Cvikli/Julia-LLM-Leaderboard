[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of the function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    blocks = map(x -> x.content, filter(x -> x.language == \"julia\", collect(Markdown.parse(md))));\n    code = join(blocks, \"\\n\");\n    return code;\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `Markdown.jl` package to parse and extract the code blocks from a markdown document with Julia language fences. The function filters out all code blocks in other languages and only retains those for Julia (i.e., where the language is defined as \"julia\"). It then joins these code blocks together into one string separated by newline characters, and returns this string.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes the input `md` is a valid markdown document in string format. Also, you have to install Markdown package via Pkg.add(\"Markdown\") if not already installed. \n\nNote: The code blocks can also contain comments starting with `#`, which are removed by joining the blocks together. If you want to keep them, additional processing would be required.","status":200,"tokens":[0,257],"elapsed":2.049339902,"_type":"aimessage"}]
