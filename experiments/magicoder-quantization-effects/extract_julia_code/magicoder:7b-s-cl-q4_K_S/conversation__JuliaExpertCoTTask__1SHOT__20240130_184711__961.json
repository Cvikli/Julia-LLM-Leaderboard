Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The function `extract_julia_code` that you are asked to write can be implemented as follows:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = String[]\n    while true\n        start = findnext(\"```julia\", md, 0)\n        if isnothing(start)\n            break\n        end\n        \n        # Remove ```julia and add newline before it.\n        push!(code_blocks, \"\\n\" * md[start[1]:end])\n        \n        md = md[nextind(md, start):end] \n    end\n    \n    # Join all code blocks together with a newline.\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function first finds all occurrences of the string `\"```julia`\"`, and then for each block, removes the surrounding fencing (i.e., ```), and adds a newline before it. The resulting code blocks are joined together with a newline character in between. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is only one level of indentation i.e. each block of code is immediately followed by another ``` markdown without any other text. Also, it does not handle nested ```julia```.","status":200,"tokens":[0,289],"elapsed":2.272468926,"_type":"aimessage"}]
