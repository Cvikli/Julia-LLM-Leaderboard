[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could write `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Find all code blocks\n    codes = eachmatch(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, 1)\n\n    # Remove fences from each block\n    cleaned_codes = [match[2] for match in codes]\n\n    # Combine the cleaned code blocks with a newline in between\n    combined_code = join([cleaned_code * \"\\n\" for cleaned_code in cleaned_codes], \"\")\n    \n    return combined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by using regex to find all \"julia\" code blocks in the markdown document. It then removes the fences from each block and joins them together with a newline between each one.\n\nNote: This function assumes that there are no other backticks (`) within the code blocks, since these would interfere with the matching process. If your markdown can contain such cases, you might need to adjust the regex or add additional checks in this function. \n\nThis solution also does not handle \"Multiple dispatch\" which is a feature of Julia where functions are associated with types and can be called on different types. This feature makes Julia flexible for dealing with various data types. For example `+` operator can operate with Int, Float64, String etc.\nYou might want to consider using the `@docs` macro in conjunction with Plots.jl to handle multiple dispatch.","status":200,"tokens":[0,343],"elapsed":2.633205116,"_type":"aimessage"}]
