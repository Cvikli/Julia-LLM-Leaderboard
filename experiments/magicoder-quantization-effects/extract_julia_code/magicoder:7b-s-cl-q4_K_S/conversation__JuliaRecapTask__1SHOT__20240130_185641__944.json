[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"This task can be achieved by using the `Md` package in Julia, which allows parsing markdown files. Here is a possible implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Md\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    blocks = parse(md)\n    julia_blocks = findall(b -> typeof(b) == Code && b.lang == \"julia\", blocks)\n    \n    # Combine code from all blocks into a single string\n    combined_code = join([string(b.text).strip() for b in julia_blocks], \"\\n\\n\")\n    return combined_code\nend\n```\n\nThe `extract_julia_code` function parses the markdown string `md` into a list of blocks using `parse`. Then it finds all the code blocks with Julia language (`Code` type, and `lang` attribute set to \"julia\"). After that, it joins their text content stripped of leading/trailing whitespace into a single string separated by two newlines. \n\nNote: This is assuming that the markdown document has code fences enclosing Julia blocks, with the `julia` language option specified. If this is not the case in your markdown documents, you may need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,290],"elapsed":2.318203234,"_type":"aimessage"}]
