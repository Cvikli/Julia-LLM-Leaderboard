[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise.

Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution using BeautifulSoup to parse the markdown:\n\n```python\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(md, 'html.parser')\n    \n    # Find all code blocks\n    code_blocks = [str(c) for c in soup.find_all('code', class_='language-julia')]\n\n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    cleaned_code = \"\\n\".join([re.sub(r\"```\\n(.*)\\n```\", r\"\\1\", c) for c in code_blocks])\n    \n    return cleaned_code\n```\nThis function assumes that all Julia code blocks are properly surrounded by ``` (backticks), which is a typical markdown syntax for code block delimiters. The regular expression `r\"```\\n(.*)\\n```\" removes these surrounding fences from each code block before joining them together with a newline character.\n\nThis function uses the BeautifulSoup library to parse the markdown into HTML, then navigates the HTML tree to find all 'code' elements with class='language-julia'. It extracts and cleans these code blocks to give you one string of Julia code.\n\nRemember that Python doesn't support multiline strings like Julia. So you have to use an escape character (\\) to wrap your string in the function definition.","status":200,"tokens":[161,328],"elapsed":19.931017441,"_type":"aimessage"}]
