[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    code_lines = String[]\n    in_block = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, '```' ) \n            in_block = !in_block\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if in_block && length(line) > 0\n            code_lines = push!(code_lines, strip(line))\n        end\n    end\n\n    return join(code_lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by looping over every line of the markdown document. If it sees a line starting with ``` (which indicates a code block), it will toggle `in_block` to true and skip this line. Otherwise, if `in_block` is true, it will strip leading/trailing whitespace from the line and add it to `code_lines`. At the end of processing all lines, it will return the concatenated string in `code_lines`.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that every code block in the markdown document ends with another ``` line. If there are multiple code blocks per document, they will be joined together with a newline. If there is no ``` line at the end of the code block, it will not get properly extracted.","status":200,"tokens":[0,295],"elapsed":2.370931757,"_type":"aimessage"}]
