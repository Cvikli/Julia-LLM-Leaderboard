Then it extracts the inner content of each code block by using `match`. The outer join is used to combine all elements in the array with a newline `\\n\\n`, which matches two consecutive line breaks.\n\nThe function `extract_julia_code` should be given a markdown string as an argument, and it would return the combined Julia code as a String.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is exactly one level of indentation (four spaces) for all lines in each block. If your blocks are indented differently or have other syntax errors, you might need to modify the regular expression accordingly. \n\nAlso please consider that this function will join all code blocks together without any distinction, if you want to keep them separate you should adjust the way they are joined at the end.","status":200,"tokens":[0,336],"elapsed":2.591991379,"_type":"aimessage"}]
