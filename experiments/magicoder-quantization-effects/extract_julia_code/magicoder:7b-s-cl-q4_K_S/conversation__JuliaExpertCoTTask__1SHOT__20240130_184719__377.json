[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple function in Julia that extracts the code blocks from a markdown document:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all indices of ```julia\n    idxs = [occ for occ in eachmatch(r\"```julia\", md)]\n    \n    # Remove the fences around each code block\n    trimmed_codes = map(x -> substr(md, x.first+6, length(md)-x.last-3), idxs)\n\n    # Combine all code blocks into one string with new lines\n    combined_code = join([strip(trimmed_codes[i]) * \"\\n\" for i in 1:length(trimmed_codes)], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return combined_code\nend\n```\nThe above function uses a regular expression `r\"```julia\" to find all code fences ( ``` ). Then it removes the code fence around each code block and combines them into one string with new lines.\n  \nPlease note that this solution assumes that there are no extra spaces before or after the ```julia in the markdown document. If your markdown documents have extra spaces, you will need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,281],"elapsed":2.197285519,"_type":"aimessage"}]
