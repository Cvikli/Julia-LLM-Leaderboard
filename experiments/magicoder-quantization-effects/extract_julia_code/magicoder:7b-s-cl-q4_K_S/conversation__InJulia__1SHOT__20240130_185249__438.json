Then it iterates over this tree to find all `CodeBlock` elements. If a block is found, it's appended to the list of blocks. Finally, these blocks are joined together with newline characters and returned as a string.\n\nRemember that you should install the Markdown package before using the function by running: \n```julia\nPkg.add(\"Markdown\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,191],"elapsed":1.466539699,"_type":"aimessage"}]
