[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might implement `extract_julia_code` function using Python's Markdown library to parse the markdown document for code blocks:\n\n```python\nimport re\nfrom markdown import markdown\nfrom markdown.extensions.codehilite import CodeHiliteExtension, CodeHilite\n\ndef extract_julia_code(markdown_doc):\n    # Use markdown to convert the markdown doc into HTML\n    html = markdown(markdown_doc)\n    \n    # Extract all code blocks from the HTML\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'<pre><code class=\"(.*?)\">(.*?)</code></pre>', html, re.DOTALL)\n\n    # Remove code fences (in this case, just removing ```...``` markers)\n    for block in code_blocks:\n        language, code = block\n        cleaned_code = re.sub(r'```', '', code, flags=re.MULTILINE)\n        \n    # Join all the code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = \"\\n\".join([c for _, c in code_blocks])\n    \n    return joined_code\n```\n\nPlease note that the above function is written in Python, not Julia. However, you can use similar approach to achieve your objective in any language that supports regular expressions and parsing of HTML/Markdown.\n\nIn case you are using Julia, it's a little bit different since there isn't a built-in markdown parser for julia yet. But the logic would still remain the same i.e. use regex to find out all the code blocks and remove the fences. \n\nFor example:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(markdown_doc)\n    # Use some library or package to convert markdown into HTML\n    html = markdown_to_html(markdown_doc)\n\n    # Find all the code blocks in the HTML document\n    code_blocks = findall(r\"<pre><code class=\\\"(.*?)\\\">(.*?)</code></pre>\", html; captures=true);\n\n    # Remove fences (in this case, just removing ```...``` markers)\n    cleaned_code = join([replace(c[2], \"```\"=>\"\") for c in code_blocks]; \"\\n\");\n\n    return cleaned_code\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[425,546],"elapsed":7.914498025,"_type":"aimessage"}]
