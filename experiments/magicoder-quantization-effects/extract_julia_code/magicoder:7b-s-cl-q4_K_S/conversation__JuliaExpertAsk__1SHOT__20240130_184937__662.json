Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function in Python to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    pattern = r'```(.*?)```'\n    matches = re.findall(pattern, md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    if len(matches) > 0:\n        return '\\n'.join([m.strip() for m in matches])\n    else:\n        return ''\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all code blocks in the markdown document.
