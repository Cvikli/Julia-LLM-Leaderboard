[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem, you would typically use string manipulation functions in Julia to extract the text within markdown code blocks and remove unwanted characters or sections of the string. Here's a simple function that could do what is described:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks within markdown using regular expression\n    blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, match_number=true))\n\n    # If no blocks found return an empty string\n    if isempty(blocks)\n        return \"\"\n    end\n\n    # Concatenate all code blocks together with a newline character \n    code = join([block.match[1] for block in blocks], \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Remove code fences (i.e., triple backticks)\n    code = replace(code, \"`\" => \"\")\n\n    return code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression (`r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n````) to match the markdown code blocks that contain Julia code. It then collects all of these matches and stores them in an array named `blocks`. If no such matches are found, it returns an empty string.\n\nAfter storing these code blocks as strings in `blocks`, we join them together with a newline character using the `join` function. The resulting string is free from any remaining code fences (i.e., triple backticks). \n\nThe `replace(code, \"`\" => \"\")` line of code removes all occurrences of the backtick character (`'`) from this final result, which are likely to be leftovers from the code block syntax used in markdown.","status":200,"tokens":[0,387],"elapsed":2.991433206,"_type":"aimessage"}]
