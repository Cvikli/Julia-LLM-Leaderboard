[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution for your problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Find all code blocks and join them together without fences\n    return replace(md, r\"```julia(.+?)```\" => s -> String(s))\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression to find the code blocks in the markdown document. It then removes the code fencing (````julia(.+?)````) and converts the remaining string to a `String`. Note that this function assumes that the markdown contains only one type of code block, which is ```julia...``` with no nested code blocks.\n\nIf you need to handle multiple types of code blocks or nested code blocks, you would have to use more complex regular expressions and possibly additional logic to properly extract and join all the code together.","status":200,"tokens":[0,195],"elapsed":2.26522926,"_type":"aimessage"}]
