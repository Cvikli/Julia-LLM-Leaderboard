Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can implement this using regular expressions in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Code block marker\n    code_block = r\"```julia\" => \"```\"\n    # Find all blocks, remove fences and join\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(code_block, md))\n    if length(matches) == 0\n        return \"\"\n    elseif length(matches) > 1\n        code_chunks = map(x -> x.match[2], matches)\n        return join([replace(chunk, \"`\" => \"\") for chunk in code_chunks], \"\\n\")\n    else\n        return replace(matches[1].match[2], \"`\" => \"\")\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this function, `eachmatch` returns an iterator over all matches of the pattern in the string. This is used to find all the julia code blocks in the markdown document. These blocks are then further processed by replacing the fences with nothing (`\"\"`) and joining them together with a newline character (`\"\\n\"`).\n\nThis function will return a single String if there's only one block of code or an empty string if there's no code at all, otherwise it will join multiple blocks of code into a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,291],"elapsed":3.293166154,"_type":"aimessage"}]
