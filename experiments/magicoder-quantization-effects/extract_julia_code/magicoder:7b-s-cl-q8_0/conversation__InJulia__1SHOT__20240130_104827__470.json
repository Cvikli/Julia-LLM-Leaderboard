If it encounters a line starting with '```' and ending with '```' (which indicates that this is a code block in julia), it starts to accumulate lines into `block` until it encounters another line ending with '```' or reaches end of document. It then appends the content of `block` to `result`. After that, it resets `block` for next block and continues with rest of the document. If it's not in a code block, it just skips that line.\n\nRemember to test this function with your own markdown files as necessary, to ensure it behaves correctly according to your requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,327],"elapsed":3.683546393,"_type":"aimessage"}]
