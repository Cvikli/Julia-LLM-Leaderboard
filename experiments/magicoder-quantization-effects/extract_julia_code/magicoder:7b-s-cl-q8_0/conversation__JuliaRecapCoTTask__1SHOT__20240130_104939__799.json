[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, let's write a function that extracts all Julia code from Markdown using regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nusing README_check: extract_code\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown string\n    code_blocks = extract_code(md, \"```julia\")\n    \n    # Remove code fences from each code block and join them together with a newline\n    full_code = reduce((x, y) -> x * \"\\n\" * y, map(strip, code_blocks))\n    \n    return full_code\nend\n```\nThe `extract_code` function is defined in the `README_check` package which we are assuming to be installed. This function extracts all occurrences of text that match a regular expression pattern inside a larger string. \n\nRemember, this assumes that there is no nested julia code block in your markdown document. If you have multiple layers of fenced blocks, it would need additional handling. Also, it assumes the fencing of code blocks to be \"```julia\" and doesn't handle the potential for different languages (e.g., python) within a single code block. You may want to adjust this according to your needs.","status":200,"tokens":[0,285],"elapsed":3.286645648,"_type":"aimessage"}]
