[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

It then extracts the content of each of these blocks, removes any code fencing (the triple backticks) and combines them into a single string. If no code blocks are found, it returns an empty string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,236],"elapsed":2.615518188,"_type":"aimessage"}]
