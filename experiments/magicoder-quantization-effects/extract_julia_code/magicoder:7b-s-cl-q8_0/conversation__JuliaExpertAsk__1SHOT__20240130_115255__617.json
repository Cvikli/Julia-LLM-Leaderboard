Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of your request using regular expressions in Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```', md, re.DOTALL)  # Find all Julia code blocks\n    cleaned_blocks = [re.sub(r'^```julia\\n|\\n```$', '', block).strip() for block in code_blocks]  # Remove code fences\n    joined_code = '\\n'.join(cleaned_blocks)\n    return joined_code\n```\nThis function uses the `re` module to find all code blocks that match the pattern `r'```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```'. The `.strip()` method is used to remove leading and trailing white spaces from each block. Then, these cleaned blocks are joined together into a single string with newline characters between them using the `\\n`.join() method.\n\nThis function will return all Julia code blocks as a single string, where each line of code block is separated by a new line. \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes you want to preserve the indentation and formatting inside the code blocks when joining them together. If you do not need to preserve these details, you can remove the strip() calls.","status":200,"tokens":[0,297],"elapsed":3.363947354,"_type":"aimessage"}]
