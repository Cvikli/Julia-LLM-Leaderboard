Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can use regular expressions to solve this problem. Here's how you could implement such function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regex and join them together\n    return matchall(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, true)|>join\nend\n```\nThis function takes a string `md` which is your markdown document. The function uses the `matchall` function to find all occurrences of the regular expression `r\"````julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"\"`. \n\nThe `.*?` part means any character (except for newline), reluctantly quantified, and the `\\n``` is the closing fence. The true argument at the end specifies that the function should ignore case when matching (`i` flag in regex). Then it joins all found code blocks into a string with `join`.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that your markdown document only contains one language block per code fences and there are no nested or overlapping code fence. If your data may contain such situations, you will have to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,261],"elapsed":2.950779089,"_type":"aimessage"}]
