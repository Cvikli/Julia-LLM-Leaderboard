[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple implementation of this function in Julia using regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regular expression to match code blocks\n    block = r\"```julia(.+?)```\"s\n\n    # Find all matches\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(block, md, overlapping=false))\n    \n    if isempty(matches)\n        return \"\"  # If no matches found, return an empty string\n    end\n\n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline.\n    code_content = join([match.captures[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\\n\")\n    \n    # Remove any remaining blank lines from the end of the content\n    while isempty(code_content) || (firstindex(code_content) == 1 && code_content[end] == '\\n')\n        pop!(code_content)\n    end\n    \n    return code_content\nend\n```\nThis function works by defining a regular expression that matches the entirety of a code block, including the language identifier (in this case \"julia\"). It then finds all instances of these code blocks within your markdown string `md` and saves them as a collection of Match objects. \n\nIt extracts each individual match into its respective capture group and appends it to the `code_content` array, separated by newline characters.\n\nAfter that, if there are leading or trailing blank lines in the extracted code content, they are removed from `code_content`. Finally, the function returns the combined code blocks as a single string. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that all code blocks start and end with code fences (````julia...```), and that there is only one type of language in each block (in this case \"julia\"). If your markdown uses different kinds of delimiters or if you have multiple languages in a single block, you might need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,446],"elapsed":5.066850677,"_type":"aimessage"}]
