Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String.

If that line also contains \"```\" (without \"julia\"), it means we have finished reading code block so it sets `in_block` back to false. At this point, if `in_block` is true and the current line doesn't contain \"```\", then it adds the content of the line into a vector called `code_lines`. After iterating through all lines, function returns joined contents in `code_lines` separated by newline characters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,435],"elapsed":4.926070046,"_type":"aimessage"}]
