[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Python function `extract_julia_code` that will extract all the Julia language code blocks from a markdown document:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # Find all code blocks in Markdown.\n    blocks = re.findall(r'```(.*?)```', md, re.DOTALL) \n    \n    # Join the code blocks and remove code fences (backticks).\n    code_str = '\\n'.join([block[2:] if block.startswith('julia') else block for block in blocks]) \n    return code_str\n```\nThis function uses Python's regular expression module (`re`) to find all text enclosed by three backticks (```...```); it also includes the `re.DOTALL` flag to make the dot (.) match any character including newlines. The function then removes the language identifier ('julia') from the code block and joins them together with newline characters.\n\nThis is a simple way of extracting code blocks and does not account for edge cases or variations in markdown syntax. In particular, it assumes that there are no backticks inside the code block (which could cause extraction errors) unless the code block is explicitly marked as 'julia' language. If you want to handle more complex Markdown rules, you would need a more sophisticated solution.","status":200,"tokens":[0,313],"elapsed":3.609486883,"_type":"aimessage"}]
