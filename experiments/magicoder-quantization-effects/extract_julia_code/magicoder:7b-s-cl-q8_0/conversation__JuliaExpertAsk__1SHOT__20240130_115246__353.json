[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise. You're precise and answer only when you're confident in the high quality of your answer.","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Question\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Python solution for your problem:\n\n```python\nimport markdown2\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    html = markdown2.markdown(md)\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')\n    \n    # find all pre tags\n    pre_tags = soup.find_all('pre')\n\n    # iterate over each pre tag and extract the inner code block\n    code_blocks = [tag.text for tag in pre_tags]\n\n    # join all extracted code blocks with a newline character \n    joined_code = '\\n'.join(code_blocks)\n    \n    return joined_code\n```\nThis function first converts the markdown string to HTML using `markdown2.markdown`. Then it uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and find all `<pre>` tags (which represent code blocks). The inner text of each `<pre>` tag is then extracted, giving us a list of all code blocks. These code blocks are then joined together with newline characters using `\\n` as the separator.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that your markdown document `md` has julia language fenced code blocks and doesn't have any other `<pre>` tags in it. If there are other kinds of code blocks or non-code block elements inside your markdown, you might need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,313],"elapsed":3.542061967,"_type":"aimessage"}]
