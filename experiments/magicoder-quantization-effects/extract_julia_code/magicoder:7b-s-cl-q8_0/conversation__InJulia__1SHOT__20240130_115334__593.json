The `matches = re.findall(r'```julia(.+?)```', md, re.DOTALL)` line finds all substrings enclosed by ```julia and ``` matching with the regular expression pattern.\n\nThe function then checks if there are multiple code blocks, and if so it joins them together with a newline. If there is only one block of code, it directly removes the fences around it. The function returns this joined string as its output.","status":200,"tokens":[0,344],"elapsed":3.882817682,"_type":"aimessage"}]
