It does this by using regular expressions to find and match all the ```julia\\n(.*?)\\n``` sections of the input string (md). The matches are collected into an array, and for each match, the captured code is extracted and appended to a single output string.\nThe function returns the final output string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,271],"elapsed":3.03091181,"_type":"aimessage"}]
