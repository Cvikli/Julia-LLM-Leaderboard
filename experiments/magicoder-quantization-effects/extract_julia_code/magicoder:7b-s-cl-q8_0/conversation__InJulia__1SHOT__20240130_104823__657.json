[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use regular expressions in Julia to find the code blocks in Markdown documents. Here's an example of how you could implement this function:\n\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regular expression pattern for matching ```julia blocks\n    code_pattern = r\"```(?:julia)?(.*?)```\"s\n    \n    matches = collect(eachmatch(code_pattern, md))\n    \n    if isempty(matches)\n        return \"\"  # No julia code found in the markdown\n    else\n        join([match[1] for match in matches]; \"\\n\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `eachmatch` function to find all instances of the regular expression pattern that matches a ```julia block```. Each match is then collected into an array, and if there are any matches at all, they are joined together with newline characters. If no matches were found, it returns an empty string.\n\nRemember that this code assumes that the input `md` is a String where all Julia code blocks have been properly formatted as ```julia code```. If the markdown might contain improperly formatted blocks or other languages' blocks, you would need to adjust your regular expression pattern accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,291],"elapsed":3.276231934,"_type":"aimessage"}]
