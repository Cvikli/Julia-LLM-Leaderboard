[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"This problem requires knowledge of regular expressions (regex), which is a powerful tool for text manipulation and pattern matching in many programming languages including Julia. We will use `Regex` function from `Base.Regex` package to find the patterns. \n\nHere's how you can solve this task:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks in markdown, ignoring fences and join with newline\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia.*?\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, dotall=true)) do match\n        join([strip(x) for x in match[1:end]], \"\\n\")\n    end\n    \n    # Return a single string with all code blocks joined by newline\n    return join(matches, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function `extract_julia_code` accepts a markdown document as input and returns a string with all Julia language code blocks joined together. The regular expression used here captures the code block between three backticks (```), followed by \"julia\" (to distinguish it from other code blocks), then any characters (including newlines), and finally another three backticks. `.*?` is a non-greedy match that stops at the first three backticks encountered, allowing us to capture multiple lines of code in a single block.\n\nThe `collect` function applies a function to all matches of the regular expression, thus collecting them into an array. The join function then concatenates these strings with newline characters between each one. \n\nNote: If you want to extract code blocks specifically written within fenced code blocks, that would require more sophisticated parsing because markdown is not a standardized format and there may be variations in the way people write their code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[0,408],"elapsed":4.688565355,"_type":"aimessage"}]
