[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is your solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String) \n    # Find all matches of the markdown code blocks (triple backticks)\n    matches = eachmatch(`r\"(?s)(```)(.*?)(```)\"`, md)\n\n    # Join the matched parts together and remove the code fences\n    code_block = join(collect(Iterators.flatten([m.captures[2] for m in matches])), \"\\n\")\n\n    return replace(code_block, r\"```julia\" => \"\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by using regular expressions to match the markdown code blocks and then joining those matched parts together. The `r\"(?s)(```)(.*?)(```)\"` regex pattern matches any string that starts and ends with ``` which is used for markdown's code fences, and it uses non-greedy `.*?` matching to match all content within the first and last code fence encountered, ignoring other potential nested ones.\n\nThe `r\"(?s)(```)(.*?)(``\")`'s s flag makes regex engine interpret the dot (.) character as newline character.\n\nOnce we have our matched parts joined together, we use replace function to remove the ```julia part at the beginning of every line. \n\nThis function extracts and returns the code blocks from the markdown document as a string, ready for further processing or execution.","status":200,"tokens":[0,326],"elapsed":3.702463523,"_type":"aimessage"}]
