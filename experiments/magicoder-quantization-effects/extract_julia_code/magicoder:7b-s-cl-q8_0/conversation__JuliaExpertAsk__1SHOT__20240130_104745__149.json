It then finds all code blocks that are labeled as 'Julia' and extracts the contents of each one, removing the surrounding code fences. If there are multiple code blocks, it adds a newline between them. The resulting string is then returned.\n  \nPlease note you have to install BeautifulSoup by using pip: `pip install beautifulsoup4` if you haven't already.","status":200,"tokens":[0,372],"elapsed":4.222609969,"_type":"aimessage"}]
