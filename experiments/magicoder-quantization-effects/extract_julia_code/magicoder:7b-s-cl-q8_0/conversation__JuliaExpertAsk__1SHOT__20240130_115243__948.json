Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of what such a function might look like:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document.\n    code_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, seperators=[\"\\n\"])\n\n    # Remove code fences from each block and join them together with a newline.\n    joined_code = join([replace(block, r\"^```julia\\n|```.*$\" => \"\") for block in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n``` \nIn this function, `matchall` is a helper function that takes a regular expression and returns all matches of the pattern in the input string. The second argument to `matchall` specifies how the function should handle overlapping matches - `\"\\n\"` ensures that newlines are treated as seperators. \n\nThe `replace` function is used to remove code fences from each block of code. It uses a regular expression that matches either the start of a block (````julia\\n`) or the end of a block (````). The `$` character in the regular expression denotes the end of the string, ensuring that the entire line is matched (and replaced). \n\nFinally, `join` combines all blocks of code into one string, with each block separated by a newline.","status":200,"tokens":[0,322],"elapsed":3.646626071,"_type":"aimessage"}]
