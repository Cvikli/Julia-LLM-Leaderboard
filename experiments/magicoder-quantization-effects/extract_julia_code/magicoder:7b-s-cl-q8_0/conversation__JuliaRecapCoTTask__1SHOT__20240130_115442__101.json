[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you might implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regular expressions and join them together.\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\", md, seed=1))\n    joined_code_blocks = mapreduce(*, (c->replace(c, r\"```julia\" => \"\")), code_blocks)\n\n    # Remove any newline characters at the start or end of each block.\n    cleaned_joined_code_blocks = join([strip(block) for block in split(joined_code_blocks, \"\\n\")], \"\\n\\n\")\n\n    return cleaned_joined_code_blocks\nend\n```\nIn the function above, `collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\", md, seed=1))` matches all code blocks in the markdown string and returns a list of these blocks. Each block is a match object which has a `match` field that contains the matched part. To get the content inside the fences we use `replace(c, r\"````julia\" => \"\")`. We then join these strings together with a newline character in between (`\"\\n\\n\"`), and finally remove any leading or trailing whitespace from each line of code using `strip(block)`. \n\nIf the function needs to handle more specific cases (for example, if it should ignore certain blocks or treat them differently) the instructions provided can be used to tweak the regular expression pattern to capture only those blocks you're interested in.","status":200,"tokens":[0,369],"elapsed":4.215012176,"_type":"aimessage"}]
