We then extract the content inside the fences and remove the fences using another regular expression. Finally, we join all the extracted codes together.\n\nRemember that this function assumes that you will only use single line comments (starting with '#') within your julia code blocks and that your markdown document is correctly formatted. If it's not the case, you might need to adjust the regular expression or add error handling accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[88,260],"elapsed":2.960660086,"_type":"aimessage"}]
