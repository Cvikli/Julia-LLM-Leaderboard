[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could implement such a function in Julia. This function will be based on the `Markdown.parse` method from the `Markdown.jl` package, which parses markdown text into a tree of elements. \n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)::String\n    blocks = split(md, \"\\n\") # Split md by newline to get individual lines\n    code_blocks = filter(b -> startswith(b, \"```julia\"), blocks) # Find all julia code blocks\n    \n    for (i, block) in enumerate(code_blocks)\n        # Remove code fences and leading/trailing whitespace from each block\n        code_blocks[i] = replace(block[7:end-3], r\"^[ \\t]*(.*?)[ \\t]*$\" => \\1) \n    end\n    \n    # Join all the code blocks together with a newline\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function works by first splitting the markdown text into individual lines (`\\n`). Then it filters out those that start with \"```julia\". Afterwards, for each block, it removes the leading and trailing fences (the 4 characters ` ``` ) and any extra whitespace. Finally, it joins all code blocks together with a newline character.\n\nThis assumes that each julia code block is separated by a blank line in your markdown document. If the blocks are not separated by blank lines, you might need to adjust this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,354],"elapsed":4.045421857,"_type":"aimessage"}]
