It splits the markdown into lines and loops through them looking for code block delimiters (```julia``, ```). When it finds a start or end delimiter, it starts or stops collecting lines of the current Julia code block. If it encounters another line in the markdown outside of a code block, but still inside the current Julia code block (i.e., with no leading whitespace), it appends that line to the current block of code. The function then returns all collected code blocks joined into a single string with newline characters between each block.","status":200,"tokens":[118,375],"elapsed":4.23190038,"_type":"aimessage"}]
