Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here's one way to implement this in Julia:\n```Julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regex pattern\n    m = matchall(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, captures=true)\n    \n    if isempty(m)  # No code block found\n        return \"\"\n    end\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join the blocks together with a newline\n    code = mapreduce(*, m.captures; init=\"\") do c\n        replace(c, r\"```julia\" => \"\")\n    end\n    return string(\"```julia\\n\", code, \"\\n```\")\nend\n```\nIn this function, `matchall` is used to find all occurrences of the pattern \"````julia(.+?)```\" in the markdown document. If there are no matches (i.e., no code blocks), an empty string \"\" is returned. Otherwise, `mapreduce` is used to join all the matched strings without the \"```julia\" and \"```\" code fences into a single string. This resulting string is then returned with the \"```julia\" and \"```\" fences added back around it.\n\nNote: The `matchall` function returns an instance of the Matches struct, which includes the captures. If there are no captures in the regex pattern, then the captures field will be empty. This is why we check if it's empty before proceeding with the code blocks extraction and joining them together.","status":200,"tokens":[118,352],"elapsed":4.004863529,"_type":"aimessage"}]
