When it encounters a code block beginning (````julia` or ```), it starts capturing lines of code until it encounters the end marker (```). It also removes any leading or trailing spaces, and replaces tabs with spaces. \n\nNote: This function assumes that there is only one level of indentation in each line of the markdown document. If the markdown includes nested code blocks, this solution won't handle them correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,392],"elapsed":4.436091287,"_type":"aimessage"}]
