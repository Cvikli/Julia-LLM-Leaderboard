[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown\n    m = matchall(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, greedy=false)\n\n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    code = reduce((c1, c2)->c1*'\\n'*c2, map(x->replace(x, r\"```julia(.+?)```\" => \"\", count=1), m))\n\n    return code\nend\n```\nThe function `extract_julia_code` takes a String `md` that represents the markdown document with Julia language code blocks. It uses regular expressions to find all the code blocks in the document. The regular expression `\"```julia(.+?)```\" matches any string between three backticks followed by \"julia\". The argument `.+?` means match anything (non-greedy) until it reaches another set of three backticks.\n\nThe `matchall` function finds all matches and returns a Vector of strings. The `map` function applies the `replace` function to each string in the vector, replacing the code block delimiters with nothing `\"\"` which effectively removes them. \n\nFinally, the `reduce` function is used to concatenate the strings in the vector with newline characters between them. \n\nThe resulting string contains all the Julia language code blocks from the input markdown document, each separated by a newline character.","status":200,"tokens":[0,337],"elapsed":3.876692242,"_type":"aimessage"}]
