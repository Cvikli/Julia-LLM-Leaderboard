It uses regular expressions to find code blocks in Markdown files:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # Find all code blocks using regex pattern\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```(.*?)```', md, re.DOTALL)\n\n    # Remove code fences and join into a single string\n    joined_code = '\\n'.join(b[4:-4] for b in code_blocks).strip()\n    \n    return joined_code\n```\n\nThis function works by first using the `findall` method of the `re` (regular expressions) module to find all instances of strings enclosed between ``` and ```. The `re.DOTALL` flag is used to make `.` match any character, including newlines. \n\nThen it uses list comprehension to remove the code fences from each block of code and join them into a single string with newline characters in between. It also strips leading/trailing white space using `strip()`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,240],"elapsed":2.05571652,"_type":"aimessage"}]
