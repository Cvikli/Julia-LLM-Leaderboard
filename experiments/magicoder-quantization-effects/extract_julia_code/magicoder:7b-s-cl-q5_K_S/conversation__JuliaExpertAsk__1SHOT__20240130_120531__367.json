Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Find all code blocks\n    regex = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\"s\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(regex, md))\n\n    if isempty(matches) \n        return \"\"\n    end\n\n    # Extract the actual code from the blocks and join them\n    code_blocks = map(m -> match(r\".*?\\n(.*)\", m.captures[1]).captures[1], matches)\n    joined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first searching for all \"julia\" code blocks in the markdown text. It then extracts each piece of code from these blocks and joins them together into a single string with newline characters between each piece of code. If there are no matches, it returns an empty string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,226],"elapsed":1.952115123,"_type":"aimessage"}]
