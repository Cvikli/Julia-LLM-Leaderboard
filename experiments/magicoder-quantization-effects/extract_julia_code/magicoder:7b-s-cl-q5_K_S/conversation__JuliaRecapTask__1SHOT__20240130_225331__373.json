[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might approach this problem using Julia's built-in Markdown parsing capabilities:\n\n```julia\nusing Documenter, Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    blocks = split(md, \"\\n```julia\")\n    code_blocks = [split(block, \"```\\n\")[1] for block in blocks if occursin(\"```julia\", block)]\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function splits the input markdown string into blocks using `split`. The first split is by `\"\\n```julia\"`, which separates code blocks from non-code sections. Then for each block, it further splits by `\"```\\n\"` to get the actual code part of the block. If a block does not contain \"```julia\", it will be ignored. Finally, all the code parts are joined together with a newline character using `join`.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is only one level of nested code blocks (i.e., if a code block contains another code block, it won't work correctly). If you need to handle multiple levels of nesting, you would have to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,280],"elapsed":2.406088162,"_type":"aimessage"}]
