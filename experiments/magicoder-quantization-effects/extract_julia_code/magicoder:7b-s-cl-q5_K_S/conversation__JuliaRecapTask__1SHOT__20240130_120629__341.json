[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String.

If it sees a code block start (three backticks followed by 'julia'), it starts accumulating lines until it sees another three backticks. It removes the 'julia' part of the language declaration from the code blocks before joining them together with newline characters. \n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\nSome text above a Julia code block\n```julia\nx = 10\ny = 20\nz = x + y\n```\nSome more text below the Julia code block.\n\"\"\"\nprint(extract_julia_code(md))\n```\nThis will output:\n```julia\nx = 10\ny = 20\nz = x + y\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,422],"elapsed":3.741591312,"_type":"aimessage"}]
