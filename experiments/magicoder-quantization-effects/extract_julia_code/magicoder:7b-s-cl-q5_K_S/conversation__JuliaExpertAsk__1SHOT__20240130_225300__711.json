Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of your request in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regex\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n\n    # Join the matched strings together with a newline\n    code_blocks = join([match[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\n\n    return code_blocks\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all code blocks in your markdown document. It then joins these code blocks together, removing the ```julia\\n and \\n``` at the end of each block. The resulting string is a single string containing all the Julia code from the markdown document.","status":200,"tokens":[0,178],"elapsed":1.488091974,"_type":"aimessage"}]
