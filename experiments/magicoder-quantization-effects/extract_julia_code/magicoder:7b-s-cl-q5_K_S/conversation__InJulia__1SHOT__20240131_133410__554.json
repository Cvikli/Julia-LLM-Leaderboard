The `collect(eachmatch(regex, md))` line finds all matches of this pattern in the input string. \n\nIt then iterates over these matches and for each one, it extracts the code block (which is stored in `match.captures[1]`) and removes any leading or trailing newlines (`chomp(match.captures[1])`). The cleaned up code block is then appended to `code_blocks` with a newline character between each block. \n\nFinally, it returns the concatenated string of all extracted code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[0,356],"elapsed":3.014554058,"_type":"aimessage"}]
