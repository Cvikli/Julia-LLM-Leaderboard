The `.*?` inside the parentheses is a lazy match, which means it will match as few characters as possible before the next character. This is useful when there are multiple code blocks in the document.\n\nThe resulting matches are then converted to an array of strings using list comprehension and `join` function is used to concatenate all the code blocks with newline character \"\\n\\n\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,267],"elapsed":2.229506845,"_type":"aimessage"}]
