It then joins these blocks together with a newline and removes any code fences that might be present. The `collect(eachmatch(...))` construct is used to collect all matches into an array, which is then mapped over to extract the actual matched strings.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the input markdown document is well-formed, meaning that there are no nested code blocks and that every code block starts with a line containing ```julia\\n and ends with a line containing just ``` without any leading or trailing whitespace.","status":200,"tokens":[0,286],"elapsed":2.385079913,"_type":"aimessage"}]
