[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might implement this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regex\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    # Extract the content of each block and remove code fences\n    code_content = mapreduce(x -> x.captures[1], vcat, code_blocks)\n    \n    # Join all blocks together with a newline\n    return join(code_content, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, `eachmatch` is used to find all occurrences of the regular expression that matches a Julia code block. The content of each code block is extracted and the fences are removed using string manipulation functions. Finally, the blocks are joined together with a newline character. \n\nNote: This assumes that your markdown document `md` contains the Julia code blocks inside three backticks (```), followed by \"julia\" on the next line, and then the actual code. The end of each block is indicated by another three backticks. \n\nIf you have different requirements for how the code blocks are formatted in your markdown document, you would need to adjust this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,298],"elapsed":2.565755508,"_type":"aimessage"}]
