Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could write this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks and remove their fences\n    blocks = replace.(split(md, \"```julia\"), \"`\" => \"\", count=2)\n    \n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    code = join([block for block in blocks if !isempty(block)], \"\\n\\n\")\n    \n    return code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first splitting the markdown string into an array of strings, where each string is a code block. It then removes the fences from each code block and joins them together with two newlines in between each block. If there are no blocks, it returns an empty string. \n\nNote: This assumes that all code blocks start and end with \"```julia\" and does not check if this is actually Julia code or not. It also doesn't handle triple back-tick fences used for other markdown features like math equations.","status":200,"tokens":[0,237],"elapsed":2.005271906,"_type":"aimessage"}]
