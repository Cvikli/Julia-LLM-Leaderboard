Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of such function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regex\n    matches = eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1)\n    \n    # Join the matched strings and remove newline characters\n    code_blocks = join([replace(m.captures[1], \"\\n\" => \"\") for m in matches]; sep=\"\\n\")\n\n    return code_blocks\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all occurrences of code blocks with the Julia language (```julia`). It then joins these blocks together, removing any newline characters that might be present.\n\nPlease note: This function assumes that there is only one level of indentation in each code block. If your markdown document has nested code blocks or other complex structures, this function may not work correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,209],"elapsed":1.739104808,"_type":"aimessage"}]
