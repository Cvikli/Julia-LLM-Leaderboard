Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = reduce((a, b) -> string(a, \"\\n\", b), map(x -> x.captures[1], code_blocks))\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all the Julia language code blocks in the markdown document. It then removes the code fences and joins the code blocks together with a newline. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no nested code blocks, and that there is only one type of code block (i.e., it doesn't handle other languages like Python or R). If your markdown document contains multiple types of code blocks or nested ones, you would need to adjust the regular expression accordingly. \n\nAlso note that this function does not account for any potential errors in the markdown syntax; if there are errors in the markdown document (like missing closing backticks), it will throw an error when trying to match the regular expressions.","status":200,"tokens":[0,296],"elapsed":2.478024731,"_type":"aimessage"}]
