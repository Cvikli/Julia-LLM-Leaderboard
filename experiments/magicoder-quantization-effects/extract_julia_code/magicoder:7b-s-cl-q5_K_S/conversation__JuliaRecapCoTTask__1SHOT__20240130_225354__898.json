[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    code = reduce((a, b)->string(a)*\"\\n\"*string(b), map(x->match(r\"\\n(.*?)\\n\", x.captures[1]).captures[1], code_blocks))\n    \n    return code\nend\n```\nIn this function `extract_julia_code`, we first use the `eachmatch` function to find all occurrences of code blocks in the markdown document. We then extract the content of each code block by matching on the regular expression `r\"\\n(.*?)\\n\"`. The `.captures[1]` is used to get the first (and only) capture from the match object, which contains the code inside the fences.\n\nFinally, we use the `reduce` function to join all of these code blocks together into a single string with newline characters between each block.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that there is one Julia code block per markdown code fence and that there are no nested code fences. If your markdown document can have multiple code blocks or nested code fences, you would need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[11,336],"elapsed":2.906112879,"_type":"aimessage"}]
