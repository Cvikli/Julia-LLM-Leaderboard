When it encounters a line starting with \"julia\", it assumes that this is a new code block and appends it to our result string after joining all previous lines (if any). If the current line does not start with \"julia\" then we append it to our result string only if the last line in our result string doesn't start with \"julia\". This way, we can handle situations where a code block is split across multiple lines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,403],"elapsed":3.467650595,"_type":"aimessage"}]
