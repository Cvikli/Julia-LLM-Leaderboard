Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of the function `extract_julia_code` in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = []\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            push!(code_blocks, \"\")\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && isempty(code_blocks)\n            continue\n        elseif !startswith(line, \"```\") && !isempty(code_blocks)\n            code = join([code for code in reverse(code_blocks)], \"\\n\")\n            push!(code_blocks, \"\")\n            return code\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each line of the markdown document.

It then joins all the collected code together and returns it.","status":200,"tokens":[254,241],"elapsed":13.489092193,"_type":"aimessage"}]
