[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function `extract_julia_code` which does what was asked in the task:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Find all code blocks\n    code_blocks = findall(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seperators=[\"\\n\"])\n    \n    # Join the code blocks together with newline character\n    raw_code = join([string(b[2]) for b in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n\n    # Remove backticks and strip white spaces \n    return replace(raw_code, \"`\" => \"\") |> string |> rstrip\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression to find all code blocks in the markdown document. The `\\n` are used for new line characters and `.*?` is a non-greedy match which will capture as few characters as possible before matching the next part of the pattern.\n\nThe extracted raw code is then joined together with newline characters, removing backticks using replace function and stripping white spaces at the end using rstrip function. \n\nThis function assumes that the markdown document only contains one type of fenced blocks containing Julia codes and doesn't have any nested or escaped code fences. If your document does contain such cases, you would need to adjust this solution accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[11,302],"elapsed":2.682488977,"_type":"aimessage"}]
