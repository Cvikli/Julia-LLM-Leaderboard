[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```(.*?)```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = reduce((a, b)->a * \"\\n\" * b.captures[1], code_blocks)\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all code blocks in the markdown document and then removes the fences from each block before joining them together with a newline character. The `reduce` function is used to sequentially apply the concatenation operation to all elements of the array, effectively joining them into one string. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no nested code blocks in your markdown document and that all code blocks are properly formatted as three backticks (```). If your markdown document has different formatting or contains nested code blocks, you might need to adjust the regular expression pattern used here accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,254],"elapsed":2.128731373,"_type":"aimessage"}]
