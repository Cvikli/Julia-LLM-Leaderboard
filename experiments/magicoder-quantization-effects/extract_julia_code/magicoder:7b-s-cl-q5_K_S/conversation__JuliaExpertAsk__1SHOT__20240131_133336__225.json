Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of your request in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia.*?```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    if isempty(code_blocks) \n        return \"\" \n    end\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = reduce((a, b)-> replace(b.match, r\"```\" => \"\"), code_blocks)\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all the Julia code blocks in the markdown document and extracts the code within them. It then joins these code blocks together with a newline character. If no code blocks are found, it returns an empty string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,197],"elapsed":1.66570649,"_type":"aimessage"}]
