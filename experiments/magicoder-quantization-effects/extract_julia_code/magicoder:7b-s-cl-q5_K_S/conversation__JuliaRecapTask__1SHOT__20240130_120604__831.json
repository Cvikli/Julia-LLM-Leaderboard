[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can implement this using Julia's RegularExpressions module:\n```julia\nimport REGEX\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    codeblocks = REGEX.matchall(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md)\n    for i in eachindex(codeblocks)\n        codeblocks[i] = strip(replace(codeblocks[i], r\"^```julia\\n|\\n```$\"=> \"\"))\n    end\n    return join(codeblocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nIn this function, we are using a regular expression to match all code blocks in the markdown document. We're looking for lines that start and end with ````julia` followed by newlines on both sides. Within these sections, the REGEX.matchall function will return a vector of strings, where each string is a julia code block.\nWe then iterate over this vector to remove the ````julia\\n` and `\\n```$` portions from each string in the array, as well as leading/trailing whitespace, using Julia's built-in strip function and replace function respectively. Finally, we join all of these strings together with a newline character using the join function, and return this result.\n\nPlease note that this function is case sensitive - it will not match blocks with the language specified in lowercase like \"```julia\", or without any language specification like \"```\". If you want to consider those cases, you may need to adjust your regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[388,353],"elapsed":3.185698622,"_type":"aimessage"}]
