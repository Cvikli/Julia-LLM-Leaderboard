[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    codeblocks = collect.(eachmatch(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    # Remove code fences from each block and join them together with a newline\n    combined_code = join([replace(block[1], \"```julia\" => \"\") for block in codeblocks], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return combined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by using regular expressions to find all the Julia code blocks in the markdown document. It then removes the ```julia and ``` from each of these blocks and combines them into a single string, with each block separated by a newline character.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes there is only one level of nested code blocks. If there are multiple levels of nesting or if you need to handle those cases, the problem will become more complex and additional logic may be needed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,240],"elapsed":2.079483543,"_type":"aimessage"}]
