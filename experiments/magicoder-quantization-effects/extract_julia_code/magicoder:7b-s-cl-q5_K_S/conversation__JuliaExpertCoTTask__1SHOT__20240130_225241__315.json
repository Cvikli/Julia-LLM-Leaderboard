[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation for the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    code_blocks = split(md, \"```\")\n    \n    # Join all code blocks together with a newline character\n    joined_code = join([block for block in code_blocks if startswith(block, \"julia\")], \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Remove the language specification from each code block (i.e., \"julia\")\n    cleaned_code = replace.(split(joined_code, \"\\n\"), r\"^julia\\s*\" => \"\")\n    \n    # Join all lines of code together with a newline character\n    final_code = join(cleaned_code, \"\\n\")\n    \n    return final_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the markdown document into blocks using `split`, then joining these blocks back together with a newline. It uses regular expressions to remove the language specification from each block (i.e., \"julia\"). The resulting code is returned as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,263],"elapsed":2.220187274,"_type":"aimessage"}]
