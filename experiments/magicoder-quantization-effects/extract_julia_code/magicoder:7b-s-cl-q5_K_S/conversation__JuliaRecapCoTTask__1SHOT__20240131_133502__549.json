[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

It then filters out any blocks that do not start with a newline character (i.e., those which are likely to be code fences). Finally, it joins all remaining code blocks together with a newline character.\n\nThis function assumes that the Julia language code blocks in the markdown document do not contain backticks (`` ` ``), and that there is always exactly one level of indentation for each line of code within the block. If these assumptions are not met, this function may produce incorrect results or throw an error. \n\nIf you need to handle more complex cases (e.g., code blocks containing backticks, or multiple levels of indentation), you would need a more complicated solution that parses the markdown as actual Markdown and then extracts Julia code from it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,289],"elapsed":2.509660279,"_type":"aimessage"}]
