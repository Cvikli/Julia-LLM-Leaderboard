The `re.findall()` function returns a list of all matches, where each match is a string that includes the entire matched text and all non-overlapping matches. The `re.DOTALL` flag makes `.` match any character at all including newline characters.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```python\nmd = \"\"\"\nHere's some code in Julia:\n```julia\na = 10\nb = 20\nc = a + b\n```\nAnd here's another block of code:\n```julia\nd = 30\ne = 40\nf = d + e\n```\n\"\"\"\nprint(extract_julia_code(md))\n```\nThis will output:\n```\na = 10\nb = 20\nc = a + b\nd = 30\ne = 40\nf = d + e\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,350],"elapsed":2.923798935,"_type":"aimessage"}]
