[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise.

Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can implement this in Python using BeautifulSoup library for parsing HTML:\n\n```python\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(md, 'html.parser')\n    \n    code_blocks = soup.findAll('code')\n    julia_code = \"\"\n    \n    for block in code_blocks:\n        if \"language-julia\" in block['class']:\n            julia_code += re.sub(r'```\\n|```', '', str(block)) + \"\\n\"\n            \n    return julia_code.strip()\n```\n\nThis function works by parsing the markdown document `md` as HTML using BeautifulSoup, then finding all code blocks in the parsed HTML. It checks if each block has a \"language-julia\" class (which indicates that it's a Julia code block), and if so, it removes the code fences from the block and appends it to `julia_code`. Finally, it returns the combined string of all Julia code blocks.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the markdown document is well-formed HTML, which means that each code block is wrapped in a `<code>` tag with a class attribute that includes \"language-julia\". If your markdown may not be well-formed or if it uses different syntax for code blocks, you would need to adjust this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,330],"elapsed":2.7713728,"_type":"aimessage"}]
