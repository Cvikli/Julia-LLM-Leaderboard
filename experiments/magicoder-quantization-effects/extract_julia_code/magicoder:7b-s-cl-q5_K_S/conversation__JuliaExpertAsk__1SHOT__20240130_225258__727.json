Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of the function using regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    # Extract and join the code blocks\n    code_blocks = mapreduce(m -> String(m.captures[1]), *, matches)\n\n    return code_blocks\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to match all occurrences of Julia code blocks in the markdown document. It then extracts and joins these blocks together, removing any newline characters that may be present within them.\n\nPlease note: This implementation assumes that there are no nested code fences (i.e., it does not account for cases where a code block is itself enclosed by another code block). If your markdown document can contain such nested structures, you would need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,225],"elapsed":1.880813586,"_type":"aimessage"}]
