[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise. You're precise and answer only when you're confident in the high quality of your answer.","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Question\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution for your problem:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    pattern = r'```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```'\n    matches = re.findall(pattern, md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    code_blocks = [match.strip() for match in matches]\n    \n    if len(code_blocks) > 1:\n        return \"\\n\".join(code_blocks)\n    else:\n        return code_blocks[0]\n```\n\nThis function uses the `re` module to find all occurrences of Julia code blocks in the markdown document. The pattern `r'```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```' matches any text between three backticks (```), followed by \"julia\" on the next line, and ending with another three backticks. The `re.DOTALL` flag makes `.` match all characters (including newlines) in the pattern.\n\nThe function then extracts the code from each match, removes leading/trailing whitespace using the `strip()` method, and joins them together into a single string with newline characters between each block of code. If there is only one code block, it simply returns that block; otherwise, it combines all blocks into a single string.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no other code fences (like ```python or ```bash) in the markdown document. If there are such fences, you might need to adjust the regular expression pattern accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,346],"elapsed":2.886675458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
