It then removes the fences from each block and joins them together with a newline character. The result is returned as a String. \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the Julia code blocks are correctly formatted according to the markdown syntax (i.e., they start with ```julia\\n and end with ```). If there are other formats used in your documents, you will need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,244],"elapsed":2.038028074,"_type":"aimessage"}]
