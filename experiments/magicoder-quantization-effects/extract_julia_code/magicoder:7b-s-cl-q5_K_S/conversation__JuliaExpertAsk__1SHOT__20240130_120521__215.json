Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use Regular expressions to solve this problem in Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```\\n(.*?)\\n```', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    if len(code_blocks) == 0:\n        return \"\"\n        \n    joined_code = \"\\n\".join(code_blocks)\n    return joined_code\n```\n\nThis function extracts all the Julia code blocks from the markdown document `md`. It uses the regular expression `'```\\n(.*?)\\n``` to match any lines between three backticks (`` ` ``), which signifies a code block in Markdown. The `re.DOTALL` flag allows the `.` special character to match any character, including newlines.\n\nIf there are no Julia code blocks found, an empty string is returned. Otherwise, all of the matched code blocks are joined together with newline characters and returned as a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,231],"elapsed":1.984814512,"_type":"aimessage"}]
