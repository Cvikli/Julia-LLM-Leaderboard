Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem using regular expressions in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document.\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```(.*?)```\", md, seed=1))\n\n    if length(matches) == 0  # No code block found\n        return \"\"\n    end\n\n    # Join all matched code blocks and remove the surrounding newlines.\n    combined_code = join(map(m -> String(m.captures[1]), matches), \"\\n\")\n\n    # Remove code fences (```...```) from the final string.\n    cleaned_code = replace(combined_code, r\"```\" => \"\")\n    \n    return cleaned_code\nend\n```\n\nThe function `extract_julia_code` first finds all occurrences of code blocks in the markdown document. It does this by matching any text enclosed within three backticks (`` ``` ```), and collects these matches. If no matches are found, it returns an empty string.\n\nAfter collecting the matches, `extract_julia_code` joins all captured code blocks together with a newline character (represented by \"\\n\"). It then removes any code fences (````...```) from this final combined code string using the `replace` function and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,318],"elapsed":2.724672351,"_type":"aimessage"}]
