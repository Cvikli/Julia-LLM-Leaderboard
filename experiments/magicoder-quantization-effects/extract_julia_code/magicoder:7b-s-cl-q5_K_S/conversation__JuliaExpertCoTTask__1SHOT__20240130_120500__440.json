Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is an implementation of the function `extract_julia_code` that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```julia\nimport Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)::String\n    blocks = Markdown.parse(md, flavor=Markdown.Flavor.CommonMark)\n    code_blocks = filter(b -> b isa Markdown.Code && startswith(b.info, \"julia\"), blocks)\n    \n    code = \"\"\n    for block in code_blocks\n        lines = split(block.code, '\\n')\n        # remove the last line if it's an empty string\n        isempty(lines[end]) && pop!(lines) \n        \n        # join all lines with newline character\n        code *= join(lines, \"\\n\")\n    end\n    \n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `Markdown.jl` package to parse the markdown document. The parsed blocks are filtered for those that contain Julia code (`startswith(b.info, \"julia\")`). Then all lines of each Julia code block are joined into a single string with newline characters in between.\nThe resulting string represents all the Julia code present in the markdown document. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes you are providing the markdown content as a String. If you're working with a file, you would use `read(filename)` to get the contents of the file.","status":200,"tokens":[0,325],"elapsed":2.835786686,"_type":"aimessage"}]
