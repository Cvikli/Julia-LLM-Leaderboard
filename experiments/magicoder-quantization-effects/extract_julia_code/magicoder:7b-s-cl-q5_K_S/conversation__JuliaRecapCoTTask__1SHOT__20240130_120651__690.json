[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"This problem can be solved using regular expressions (regex). A simple approach is to iterate through each line of the markdown document and, if we encounter a code block, start collecting all lines until we hit another code block or reach the end of the file. Then remove the fences from that collected string. Here's a rough sketch of how you might implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    result = \"\"\n    in_block = false\n    \n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        if occursin(\"```julia\", line)\n            if in_block\n                result *= replace(result, r\"```\" => \"\")  # remove old block's fences\n                return result\n            else\n                in_block = true\n            end\n        end\n        \n        if in_block\n            push!(result, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"\"   # No code blocks found.\nend\n```\n\nNote that this function is case-sensitive and only checks for the string \"```julia\", so make sure to adjust it according to your document's specific syntax.\nAlso, this function assumes that there are no nested code blocks within one another. If there can be such cases, the function will need a more complex solution. \n\nThe `eachline` function splits the string into lines. This is useful because it also takes care of newline characters at the end of each line (if any). The `push!` function adds an element to a list or array. If the list or array does not exist yet, it creates one. \n\nThe `replace` function replaces all occurrences of a pattern with another string in a larger string. In this case, we use regular expressions to replace both backticks (`) and \"```julia\" with an empty string, effectively removing the code fences.\n\nThis function returns the concatenation of all code blocks found in the markdown document without their respective fences.","status":200,"tokens":[0,448],"elapsed":3.961920074,"_type":"aimessage"}]
