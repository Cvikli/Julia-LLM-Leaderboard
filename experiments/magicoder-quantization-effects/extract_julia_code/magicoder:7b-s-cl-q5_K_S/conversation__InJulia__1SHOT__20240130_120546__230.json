It then selects all the julia code blocks (all blocks after the first one) and joins them together. The resulting string is a single, concatenated string containing all Julia code from the markdown document.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that your markdown file is well-formatted i.e., there are no empty lines or misplaced fences in between blocks. \n\nAlso, it only extracts Julia code blocks starting with `#!`. If you have multiple julia code blocks and want to combine them all, regardless of their starting line, use `join([block for block in blocks[2:end]], \"\\n\")`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,268],"elapsed":2.295450981,"_type":"aimessage"}]
