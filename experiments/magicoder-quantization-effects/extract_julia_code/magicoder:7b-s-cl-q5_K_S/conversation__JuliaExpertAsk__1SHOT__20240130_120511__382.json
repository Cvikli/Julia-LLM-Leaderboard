Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem by using regular expressions in Julia. Here is a possible solution:\n\n```julia\nusing REGEX\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Extract code blocks using regex\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\", md, re\"s\"))\n    \n    if isempty(matches)\n        return \"\"  # Return empty string if no julia code blocks are found\n    end\n    \n    # Concatenate the matches and remove code fences\n    code_block = join([match.captures[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\n    return replace(code_block, \"`\" => \"\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first matching all the julia code blocks in the markdown document using a regular expression. It then concatenates these matched strings together (with newlines), removes any remaining code fences, and returns the result as a String. \n\nIf there are no matches, an empty string is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[118,234],"elapsed":2.042060554,"_type":"aimessage"}]
