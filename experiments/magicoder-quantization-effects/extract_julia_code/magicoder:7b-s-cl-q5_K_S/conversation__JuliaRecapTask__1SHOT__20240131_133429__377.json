[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might implement this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # This function will return the code blocks as a string\n    # We'll use a regular expression to find all code fences and remove them\n    # Then, we'll join the lines together with a newline character\n    return replace(replace(md, r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s => \"\\1\"; m -> !isnothing(m)), \"\\n\"*r\"\\n\" => \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to match the code fences and then replace them with the captured text. The `replace` function takes two arguments: a string, which is what you want to replace in the original string, and a regular expression pattern (in this case, r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s), which matches the code fences. The third argument to `replace` is a function that applies to each match found by the regex. In this case, we're checking if the match isn't nothing (`!isnothing(m)`) and only replacing it if it's not nothing (i.e., there was a match).\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that all code blocks are well-formed and correctly formatted with the correct language indicator (````julia`) before and after the code block, and that there is exactly one newline character between each line of code. \n\nFor more complex markdown files or to handle edge cases, you would need a more sophisticated approach, possibly using a parsing library like Parsers.jl or Markdown.jl.","status":200,"tokens":[0,368],"elapsed":3.216979103,"_type":"aimessage"}]
