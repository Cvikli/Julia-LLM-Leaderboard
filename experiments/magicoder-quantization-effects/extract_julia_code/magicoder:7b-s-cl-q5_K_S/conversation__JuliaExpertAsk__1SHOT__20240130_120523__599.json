Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple implementation of your problem in Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # find all code blocks\n    matches = re.findall('```.*?```', md, re.DOTALL) \n    \n    # remove the triple backticks and join with newline\n    result = \"\\n\".join([match[3:-3] for match in matches]) \n    \n    return result\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression to find all code blocks in the markdown document. The `re.DOTALL` flag makes sure that `.` will also match newline characters. Then, it removes the code fences and joins the code blocks with newlines. \n\nKeep in mind this is a very basic solution and might not work perfectly for all situations. For example, it assumes that there are no triple backticks (`) inside your Julia code. If there can be, you would need a more complex regular expression to match these correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,224],"elapsed":1.925687056,"_type":"aimessage"}]
