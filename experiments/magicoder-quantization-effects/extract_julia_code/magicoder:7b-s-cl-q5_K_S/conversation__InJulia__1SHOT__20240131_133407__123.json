[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String.

When it encounters a line starting with ``` (which denotes a code block), it toggles `in_code_block` to true or false depending on its current state. If `in_code_block` is true, it checks if the line starts with \"julia:\". If so, it extracts the actual code from that line and all following lines (with leading spaces) until it encounters a line starting with ``` again. It then adds this code to `code_blocks`. Finally, it returns all the extracted code blocks joined together into a single string separated by newline characters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,335],"elapsed":2.833990698,"_type":"aimessage"}]
