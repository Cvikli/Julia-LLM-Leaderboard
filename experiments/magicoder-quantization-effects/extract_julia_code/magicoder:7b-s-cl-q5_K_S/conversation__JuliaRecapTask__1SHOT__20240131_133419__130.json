[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is an example of how you could implement this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Find all code blocks using regex pattern\n    codes = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    cleaned_codes = reduce((a, b)->a*\"\\n\"*b, map(m->match(r\"\\n(.*)\", m.captures[1]).captures[1], codes))\n    \n    return cleaned_codes\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `eachmatch` function to find all occurrences of the code block pattern in the markdown document. It then extracts and cleans up each matched string, joining them together with a newline character. The regex pattern used here is for the typical markdown fenced code blocks that Julia uses.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no nested code blocks within other code blocks, and also that there's always a newline after the opening code block marker (````julia`). If either of these assumptions isn't true in your use case, you may need to adjust the regex pattern or the cleanup logic accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[388,287],"elapsed":2.54543348,"_type":"aimessage"}]
