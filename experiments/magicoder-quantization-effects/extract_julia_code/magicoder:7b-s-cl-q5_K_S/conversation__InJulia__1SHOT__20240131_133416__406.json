It also handles cases where there are multiple code blocks in the input string.\n\nPlease note that this is a very basic implementation, it doesn't handle all possible edge cases (for example, if there are nested code blocks), but it should work for most common scenarios. For more complex use-cases, you may need to adjust or extend this function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,306],"elapsed":2.588419589,"_type":"aimessage"}]
