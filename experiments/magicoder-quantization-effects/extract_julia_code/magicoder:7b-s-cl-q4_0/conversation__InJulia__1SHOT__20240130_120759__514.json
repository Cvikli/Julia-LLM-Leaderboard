If it encounters a line starting with \"```julia\", it starts processing the subsequent lines as a code block. When it encounters a line ending the code block (i.e., a line that ends with \"```\"), it stops processing the code block and adds it to `result`. All other lines are appended to `result` without fences if they are inside a code block. \n\nYou can then use this function like so:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\nSome text before...\n```julia\nfunction myfunc()\n    println(\"Hello, world!\")\nend\nmyfunc()\n```\nSome text after...\n\"\"\"\nprintln(extract_julia_code(md))\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,393],"elapsed":2.973298272,"_type":"aimessage"}]
