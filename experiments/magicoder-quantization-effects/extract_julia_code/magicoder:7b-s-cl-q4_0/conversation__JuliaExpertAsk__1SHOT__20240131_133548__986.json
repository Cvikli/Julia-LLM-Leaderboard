Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # Find all Julia code blocks in markdown document\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```(?:julia|JULIA)\\n(.*?)```', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    if len(code_blocks) == 0:\n        return \"\"\n    \n    # Concatenate code blocks and remove code fences\n    joined_code = \"\\n\".join(code_blocks)\n    no_fence_code = re.sub(r'```', '', joined_code)\n    \n    return no_fence_code\n```\n\nThis function uses the `re` module to find all Julia code blocks in the markdown document, then concatenates them together with a newline character between each block. It also removes the triple backticks (`` ` `` ``) that indicate the start and end of a code block.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that all Julia code blocks are correctly formatted, i.e., they start and end with three backticks followed by either \"julia\" or \"JULIA\". If your markdown document may contain other types of fenced code blocks, you would need a more complex regular expression to match only the ones that begin with `` ` `` `` ``` and end with `` ``` .","status":200,"tokens":[0,312],"elapsed":2.344204889,"_type":"aimessage"}]
