[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might accomplish this task in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks with language hint julia, remove code fences and join them together\n    # Regular expression to match ```julia(.*?)``` or ` `` `julia \n    # (.*?)``` or `\\`\\`\\`julia(.*?)\\`\\`\\`\n    m = eachmatch(r\"```julia(.*?)```\"m, md)\n    code_blocks = [capture[2] for capture in m]\n    \n    if isempty(code_blocks)\n        return \"\"\n    end\n    \n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `eachmatch` function to find all matches of the regular expression pattern `\"\"\"julia(.*?)\"\"\"m`. The `.*?` part is a non-greedy match that will match as few characters as possible, which means it will stop at the end of the first code block.\n\nThis assumes that there are no escaped backticks in your markdown file (which might not be the case if you wrote it by hand). If there are, you would need a more complex regular expression to handle this situation correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,301],"elapsed":2.342849777,"_type":"aimessage"}]
