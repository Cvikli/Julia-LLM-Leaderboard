It then removes the code fences from each block and joins them together with a newline character. The `reduce` function is used to concatenate all the blocks into one string. \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that there are no nested code blocks, i.e., it does not handle cases where Julia code blocks are nested within other types of code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[88,228],"elapsed":1.707970357,"_type":"aimessage"}]
