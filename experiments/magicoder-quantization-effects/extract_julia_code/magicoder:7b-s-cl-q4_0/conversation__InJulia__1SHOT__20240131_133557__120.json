It then concatenates these blocks together with newline characters, removing the initial and trailing newlines that are included as part of the code block structure. The resulting string is returned by the function. If there are no code blocks in the document, an empty string is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,235],"elapsed":1.756566796,"_type":"aimessage"}]
