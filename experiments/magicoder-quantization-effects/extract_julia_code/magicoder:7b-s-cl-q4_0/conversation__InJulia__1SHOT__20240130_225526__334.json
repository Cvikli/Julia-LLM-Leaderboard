The `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\" pattern matches any string that starts with \"```julia\\n\", followed by any number of characters (`.*?`), and ends with \"\\n```\". The collect(eachmatch(...)) function returns an array of tuples, where each tuple contains the matched strings.\n\nThe join(...) function then concatenates all these strings together with a newline character in between. \n\nPlease note that this is a very simple solution. It assumes that there are no nested code blocks and does not handle any errors if the input string does not match the expected pattern.","status":200,"tokens":[0,260],"elapsed":1.919442143,"_type":"aimessage"}]
