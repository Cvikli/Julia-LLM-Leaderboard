This function uses the re module which allows us to use regular expressions in Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # Find all code blocks in md string\n    blocks = re.findall(r'```julia(.+?)```', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # Concatenate all code blocks with a newline between each block\n    return \"\\n\".join(blocks)\n```\n\nIn the function `extract_julia_code`, we use the regular expression `r'` ```julia(.+?)` ``' to find all matching strings. The `.+?` is a lazy match and will stop at the first closing triple-backticks (```), which means it can handle multiple code blocks in the input string. \n\nThe `re.DOTALL` flag allows for the dot (.) to match any character including newline, which allows us to find code block even if they are spread over multiple lines. \n\nFinally, we join all code blocks with a newline using `\"\\n\".join(blocks)`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,265],"elapsed":2.026106203,"_type":"aimessage"}]
