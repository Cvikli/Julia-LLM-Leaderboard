Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks\n    blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, 1))\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join the blocks together with a newline\n    joined_blocks = join([replace(block, \"`\" => \"\") for block in blocks], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_blocks\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all occurrences of Julia code blocks in the markdown document. It then removes the code fence characters and joins the blocks together with a newline character. \n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes that the input `md` is a string containing the markdown content, and it also assumes that each Julia code block starts with \"```julia\\n\" and ends with \"\\n```\". If your markdown document uses different conventions for code blocks or if you want to handle them in a more complex way, you will need to adjust this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,243],"elapsed":1.800340837,"_type":"aimessage"}]
