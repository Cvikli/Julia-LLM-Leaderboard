[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code = \"\"\n    in_block, block = false, \"\"\n\n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_block = true\n            continue\n        elseif in_block && endswith(line, \"```\")\n            in_block = false\n            code *= block * \"\\n\"\n            block = \"\"\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if in_block\n            block *= replace(line, r\"```julia.*\\n\" => \"\")\n        end\n    end\n\n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating through each line of the markdown document. If a line starts with ```julia (indicating the start of a code block), it sets `in_block` to true and continues. If the line ends a code block (```), it sets `in_block` to false, appends the block to the `code` variable with a newline, and resets the `block`. It then continues to the next line. If the function is currently in a code block (indicated by `in_block`), it appends the line without the ```julia... part to the `block`.\nFinally, after going through all lines, it returns the concatenation of all code blocks with newlines between each block.","status":200,"tokens":[0,336],"elapsed":2.591558808,"_type":"aimessage"}]
