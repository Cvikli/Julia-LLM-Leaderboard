[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple solution using regular expressions in Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```julia(.+?)```', md, re.DOTALL)\n    return '\\n'.join(code_blocks)\n\nprint(extract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\"))\n```\n\nThis function uses the `re` module to find all occurrences of code blocks in the markdown document. The regular expression `r'````julia(.+?)```' matches any code block delimited by ``` and ``` that contains 'julia'. The `.+?` is a non-greedy matcher which matches as few characters as possible between two ``` marks, effectively capturing the content of each code block.\n\nThe `re.DOTALL` flag makes the dot (.) in the regular expression match any character, including newlines. Without this flag, `.` would not match newline characters.\n\nFinally, we join all the code blocks together with a newline using the `join` method and return the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,266],"elapsed":1.982709686,"_type":"aimessage"}]
