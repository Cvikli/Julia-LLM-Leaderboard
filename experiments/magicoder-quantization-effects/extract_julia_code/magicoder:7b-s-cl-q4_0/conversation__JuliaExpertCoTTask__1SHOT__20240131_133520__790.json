[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you can solve the problem using regular expressions in Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```julia(.+?)```', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # join the blocks with a newline and remove any leading or trailing newlines\n    return \"\\n\".join([block.strip() for block in code_blocks])\n```\n\nThis function uses the `re` module's `findall` method to find all matches of the regular expression ```julia(.+?)``` in the markdown string. The `.+?` is a lazy quantifier that matches any character (.) one or more times but as few times as possible, effectively capturing all code blocks.\n\nThe `re.DOTALL` flag tells Python to match any characters including newlines with the dot (.) in the regular expression. Without this flag, `.+?` would only match until it encounters a newline, ignoring everything after that. \n\nFinally, we join all the code blocks together with a newline and remove any leading or trailing newlines from each block before returning the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,273],"elapsed":2.060805161,"_type":"aimessage"}]
