It recursively calls itself on the rest of the string after each match. \n\nThis function uses regular expressions (`r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\") to identify code blocks, where \"```\" denotes a code block and \"\\n\" denotes a newline. The `.*?` pattern matches any character (except for a newline) between the two newlines, making it non-greedy so that it stops at the first closing triple backticks (```).","status":200,"tokens":[0,342],"elapsed":2.570725831,"_type":"aimessage"}]
