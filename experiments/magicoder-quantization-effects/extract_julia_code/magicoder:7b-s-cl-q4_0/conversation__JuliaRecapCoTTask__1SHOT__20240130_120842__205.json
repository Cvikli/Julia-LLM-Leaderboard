[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example solution using Julia's Markdown parsing capabilities:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Parse the markdown string to an AST\n    md_ast = parse_markdown(md)\n    \n    code_blocks = String[]\n    for item in md_ast.content\n        if isa(item, CodeBlock)\n            push!(code_blocks, join([x.value for x in item.text], \"\\n\"))\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Join all the code blocks together with a newline\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function firstly parses the markdown content to Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). Then it goes through every item in AST. If an item is `CodeBlock`, it extracts the code and pushes them into `code_blocks`. Finally, it joins all the blocks together with a newline. Note that it assumes that there're no other types of content between code blocks (like text).\n\nPlease note: It doesn't remove fences (```` or ```) from each block as they are not needed for Julia to execute it.\n\nThe `CodeBlock` is a struct in the Markdown package representing a markdown code block. The field `text` of this struct contains an array of `Text` objects which contain the actual text inside the code block.","status":200,"tokens":[0,326],"elapsed":2.542585416,"_type":"aimessage"}]
