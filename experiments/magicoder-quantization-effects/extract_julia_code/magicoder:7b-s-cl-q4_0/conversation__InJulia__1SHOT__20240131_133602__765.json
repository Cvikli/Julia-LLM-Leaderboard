[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could write this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all the code blocks\n    blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, 1))\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = join([m.captures[1] for m in blocks]; '\\n')\n    \n    return String(joined_code)\nend\n```\nIn this function, we use regex to match all the julia language code blocks in the markdown document. `eachmatch` returns a MatchIterator which is an iterator of Match objects, each representing a single occurrence of the pattern. We collect these into an array and then join them together with a newline character. The resulting string does not contain any fence markers (````julia\\n or \\n```) anymore.\n\nNote: This function assumes that there are no nested code blocks in the markdown document. If there could be, you'd need to adjust this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,251],"elapsed":1.884163971,"_type":"aimessage"}]
