Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regex\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, 1))\n    \n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = join([m.captures[1] for m in matches], \"\\n\")\n\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression to find all occurrences of Julia language code blocks in the markdown document. It then joins these together with newline characters, effectively removing the code fences (````julia\\n...\\n```) and combining them into one string. \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that there is only one level of indentation (i.e., no nested code blocks) in your markdown document. If you have more complex scenarios, you may need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,235],"elapsed":1.735329102,"_type":"aimessage"}]
