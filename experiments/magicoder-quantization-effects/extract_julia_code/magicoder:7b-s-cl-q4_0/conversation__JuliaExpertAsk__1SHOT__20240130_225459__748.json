Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regex\n    blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, 1))\n    \n    if isempty(blocks)\n        return \"\"\n    end\n\n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = join(blocks, \"\\n\")\n\n    # Remove the code fences\n    cleaned_code = replace(joined_code, \"`\" => \"\")\n    \n    return cleaned_code\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all code blocks in the markdown document. It then joins these blocks together with a newline and removes the code fences using the `replace` function. If no code blocks are found, it returns an empty string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,202],"elapsed":1.491881945,"_type":"aimessage"}]
