Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    if isempty(code_blocks)\n        return \"\"\n    end\n\n    # Extract the content of each code block and join them together with a newline\n    code = join([match.captures[1] for match in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n\n    # Remove backticks (code fences)\n    cleaned_code = replace(code, \"`\" => \"\")\n\n    return cleaned_code\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all occurrences of Julia language code blocks in the markdown document. It then joins the content of these blocks together with a newline character and removes any backticks (code fences) that might be present in the extracted code. The resulting string is returned as output. If no code blocks are found, an empty string is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,260],"elapsed":1.94984226,"_type":"aimessage"}]
