It then cleans up the code by removing backticks from the fences, joining all of the extracted code together into a single string with newline characters. \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the markdown syntax for code blocks is used exactly as described (backticks surrounding the language and code). If your markdown uses different syntax, you would need to modify the regular expression pattern accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[88,259],"elapsed":1.97677281,"_type":"aimessage"}]
