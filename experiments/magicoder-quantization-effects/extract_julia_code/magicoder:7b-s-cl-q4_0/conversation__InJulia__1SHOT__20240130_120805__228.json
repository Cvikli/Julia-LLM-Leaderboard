[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use regular expressions to solve this problem. The following function, `extract_julia_code`, uses a single regex pattern to match both fenced julia code blocks and markdown syntax for escaping underscores. It then replaces these matches with an empty string. Finally, it joins all the remaining matched strings together with a newline character:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Matches both fenced julia code blocks and escaped underscores in markdown syntax\n    pattern = r\"(?s)(?<=\\n)```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\\n|\\\\_\\_\"\n\n    # Replace matches with an empty string\n    md = replace(md, pattern => \"\")\n    \n    # Join all matched strings together with a newline character\n    code_blocks = join([l for l in eachline(IOBuffer(md)) if !isempty(l)], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return code_blocks\nend\n```\n\nHere, `?<=\\n` is a positive lookbehind to ensure that the match only occurs after a newline character. `(.*?)` is a lazy quantifier that matches any character (except for a newline) as few times as possible. `\\n```\\n` and `\\\\_\\_` are the patterns for fenced julia code blocks and escaped underscores respectively. \n\nPlease note, this function assumes that the input is well-formed, i.e., there are no mismatched or nested code blocks. If you have such cases in your data, additional logic may be needed to handle these edge cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,359],"elapsed":2.716207884,"_type":"aimessage"}]
