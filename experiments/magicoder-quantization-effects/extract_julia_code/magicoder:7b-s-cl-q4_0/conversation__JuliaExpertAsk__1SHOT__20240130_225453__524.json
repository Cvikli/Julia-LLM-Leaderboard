Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regex\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, 1))\n    \n    # Join the code blocks together with newline\n    joined_code = join([m.captures[1] for m in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Remove code fences\n    cleaned_code = replace(joined_code, \"`\" => \"\")\n    \n    return cleaned_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by using a regular expression to find all the Julia code blocks in the markdown document. It then joins these together with a newline character and removes any remaining backticks (which are used for code fencing). The resulting string is returned as the output of the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,205],"elapsed":1.51397521,"_type":"aimessage"}]
