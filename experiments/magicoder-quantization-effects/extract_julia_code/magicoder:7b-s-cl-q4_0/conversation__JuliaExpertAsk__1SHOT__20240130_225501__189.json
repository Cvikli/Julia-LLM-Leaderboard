Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, 1))\n    \n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline in between\n    joined_code = join([strip(m.captures[1]) for m in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all occurrences of Julia language code blocks in the markdown document `md`. It then strips off the leading and trailing newlines from each block, joins them together with a newline in between, and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,188],"elapsed":1.393949689,"_type":"aimessage"}]
