[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is one way to write this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all occurrences of the code fence\n    m = eachmatch(r\"```julia(.*?)```\", md, 1)\n    if isempty(m) # no julia code blocks found\n        return \"\"\n    end\n    # Extract and join the code blocks with newline\n    code_blocks = map(x -> chomp(x[2]), m)\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses a regular expression to find all occurrences of the markdown code fence that is used for julia language (i.e., `\"```julia\"). The \".\" character in the regex means any character, and the \"*\" means zero or more of these characters. So it will match any number of any characters between two pairs of backticks (`), with \"julia\" being literally right after the opening ````.\n\nThe function then maps over the matches to extract the code within the fences (using chomp to remove the code fence from both ends), and joins these code blocks together with a newline. If no julia language code blocks are found, an empty string is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,288],"elapsed":2.168557514,"_type":"aimessage"}]
