[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, Here is an example of how you might solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Find all code blocks and remove backticks from them\n    raw_blocks = replace.(eachmatch(r\"```julia(.*?)```\", md; capture=2), \"`\" => \"\")\n    \n    # Join the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline \n    joined_code = join(raw_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, `eachmatch` is used to find all instances of the pattern \"```julia(.*?)```\", which matches the markdown code fences with Julia. The capture=2 argument indicates that we're interested in the second (and only) match group from each occurrence of the pattern.\n\nThen, `replace.(eachmatch(r\"```julia(.*?)```\", md; capture=2), \"`\" => \"\")` is used to replace all backticks (``) with nothing, effectively removing the code fences. This is done using the broadcasting syntax because `replace` requires an iterable (like an array or a tuple) to apply to every element of its first argument. The result is then joined together with a newline (\"\\n\") and returned as a string.\n\nNote that this assumes that all code blocks are surrounded by triple backticks (```), and that there's only one Julia language block in each match group. If the input might have multiple Julia blocks or other languages, you would need to modify the pattern to match only Julia blocks, and handle these cases accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,374],"elapsed":2.942903178,"_type":"aimessage"}]
