Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is an implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regular expression \n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, match_type=MATCH_NORMAL))\n\n    # Extract content of each code block\n    codes = [match[1] for match in matches]\n    \n    # Join the codes together with a newline\n    return join(codes, \"\\n\") * \"\\n\"\nend\n```\nThis function works by using regular expressions to find all occurrences of code blocks. Each occurrence is stored as a tuple where the first element is the matched string (which includes the code block) and the second element is the zero-based start index of the match in the original string. \n\nThe `collect` function is used to convert this array of tuples into an actual Array, so that it can be iterated over multiple times if necessary.\n\nEach tuple's first element (the matched string) is then extracted and stored in a new Array.\n\nFinally, all the code blocks are joined together with a newline character between each block to form a single String, which is returned by the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,290],"elapsed":2.197884157,"_type":"aimessage"}]
