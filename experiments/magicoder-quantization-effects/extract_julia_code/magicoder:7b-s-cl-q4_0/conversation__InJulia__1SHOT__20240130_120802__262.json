[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can solve this problem in Julia using regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Matches all code blocks, excluding the first and last lines which are fences \n    regex = r\"```julia(?:.|\\n)*?```\"\n    \n    matches = collect(eachmatch(regex, md)) # get an array of all matches\n\n    # Remove fences (first and last line) from each code block\n    for match in matches\n        code_block = match.match \n        lines = split(code_block, '\\n') \n        lines[1] = \"\" \n        lines[end] = \"\"  \n        new_code_block = join(lines, '\\n')\n        \n        # replace old code block with new code block in string\n        md = replace(md, match.match => new_code_block)\n    end\n    \n    # Join all the matches together with a newline between each one\n    result = join([m.match for m in collect(eachmatch(regex, md))], \"\\n\\n\")\n\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by firstly defining a regular expression that matches all Julia code blocks from the markdown document (excluding fences). It then iterates over each match and removes the first and last lines of each block. Finally, it joins all the remaining matched strings together with a newline between each one and returns this result.\n\nPlease note: This function modifies the input string `md`. If you do not want to modify the original string, make a copy of the string before using this function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,371],"elapsed":2.808578186,"_type":"aimessage"}]
