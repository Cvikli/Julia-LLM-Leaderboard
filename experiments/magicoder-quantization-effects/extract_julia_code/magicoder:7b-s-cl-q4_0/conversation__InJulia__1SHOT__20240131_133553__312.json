The pattern `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\" matches any string between three backticks (```), followed by \"julia\", a newline (\\n), and then anything (.*?) until another newline (\\n) is found. \n\nThen, the code blocks are joined with a newline character and the backticks are removed using `replace` function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,232],"elapsed":1.740840619,"_type":"aimessage"}]
