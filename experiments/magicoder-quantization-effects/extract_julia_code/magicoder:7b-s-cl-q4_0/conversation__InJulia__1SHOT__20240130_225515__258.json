It then removes the code fence characters and joins the code blocks together with a newline character. The `collect` function is used to convert the iterator returned by `eachmatch` into an array, which allows us to index into it using 1-based indices (as required by `eachmatch`).\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes that there are no nested code blocks in your markdown document and that all code blocks use the \"julia\" language specification. If these assumptions do not hold, you may need a more complex solution.","status":200,"tokens":[0,260],"elapsed":1.917919818,"_type":"aimessage"}]
