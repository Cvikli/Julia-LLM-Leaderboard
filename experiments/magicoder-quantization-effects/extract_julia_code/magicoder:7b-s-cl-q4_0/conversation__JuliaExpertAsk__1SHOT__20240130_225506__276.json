Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regex pattern\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, 1))\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = join([split(block, \"\\n\")[2:end] for block in code_blocks]; join=\"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all code blocks that start with \"```julia\" and end with \"```\". It then removes the fences from each block, joins them together with a newline character, and returns the result as a string. Note that this assumes that there are no empty lines in your code blocks. If there could be, you would need to modify the join operation accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,215],"elapsed":1.589046813,"_type":"aimessage"}]
