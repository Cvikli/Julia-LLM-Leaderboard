The regex pattern `\"\"\"(.*?)\"\"\"s` matches any string enclosed by backticks (```), and the capture group `(.*?)` captures everything in between (but non-greedy to avoid grabbing too much).\n\nThe function `extract_julia_code(md::String)` takes a markdown document as input, and returns a String that is a combination of all the code blocks found. The `join` function concatenates each block of code into one string with newlines in between, and the `[block[2:end-1] for block in codeblocks]` part removes the first line (which starts with \"`\") and last line (which ends with \"`\") from each code block before combining.","status":200,"tokens":[0,318],"elapsed":2.400890245,"_type":"aimessage"}]
