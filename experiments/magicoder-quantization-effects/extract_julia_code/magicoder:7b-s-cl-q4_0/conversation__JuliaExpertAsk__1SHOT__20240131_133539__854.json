Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = []\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            push!(code_blocks, \"\")\n        end\n        \n        if !isempty(code_blocks) && (startswith(line, \"```\") || isempty(line))\n            pop!(code_blocks)\n        elseif !isempty(code_blocks)\n            code_blocks[end] *= line[7:end]\n        end\n    end\n    \n    join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function splits the markdown document into lines and iterates over each line. If it encounters a line that starts with \"```julia\", it adds an empty string to `code_blocks` (representing a new code block). If it encounters a line that starts with \"```\" or is empty, it removes the last element of `code_blocks` (indicating the end of a code block). Otherwise, it appends the line's content to the last element of `code_blocks`. \n\nFinally, it joins all elements in `code_blocks` with newline characters and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,320],"elapsed":2.400461216,"_type":"aimessage"}]
