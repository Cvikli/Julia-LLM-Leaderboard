Each match is a tuple with two elements: the full match (including fences and newline) and the inner content of the code block. The map function is used to select only the inner content, then reduce joins them together into one string. If there are multiple consecutive matches, they will be joined by a newline character.","status":200,"tokens":[0,203],"elapsed":1.737813761,"_type":"aimessage"}]
