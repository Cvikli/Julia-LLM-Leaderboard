[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise.

Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function in Python to solve this task:\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    pattern = r\"```julia(.+?)```\"\n    code_blocks = re.findall(pattern, md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    for i in range(len(code_blocks)):\n        # Remove backticks (`) from start and end of each block\n        code_blocks[i] = code_blocks[i].strip('`') \n        \n    return '\\n'.join(code_blocks)\n```\nIn this function, we're using a regex pattern to find all the `julia` language code blocks in the markdown document. `re.DOTALL` makes sure that `.` matches any character including newline. Then we just strip backticks from start and end of each block and join them together with a newline.\n\nThis function assumes that there are no empty lines or extra whitespace inside the code blocks, otherwise some additional preprocessing might be needed. Also it does not handle escaping within the code block as this is a non-standard behavior for Julia code in markdown files (usually we use fenced code blocks without any language tag). If your `md` input has such cases, you may need to enhance the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,299],"elapsed":2.578775216,"_type":"aimessage"}]
