Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can define this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    code_blocks = [match.captures[1] for match in matches]\n    \n    if isempty(code_blocks)\n        return \"\" # Return empty string if no code blocks are found\n    else\n        joined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\") # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n        \n        # Remove code fences (````julia\\n and \\n```) from the joined code\n        cleaned_code = replace(joined_code, \"`\" * \"```julia\\n\", \"\") * \"\\n\"\n        cleaned_code = replace(cleaned_code, \"\\n\" * \"`\", \"\")\n        \n        return cleaned_code\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by looking for all occurrences of a code block that starts with \"```julia\\n\" and ends with \"\\n```\". Then it extracts the contents inside these blocks. If there are multiple code blocks, it joins them together with a newline character in between. It also removes the code fences (````julia\\n and \\n```) from the joined code before returning it as a string.\n\nRemember to replace `md` with your markdown document content.","status":200,"tokens":[0,342],"elapsed":2.942167605,"_type":"aimessage"}]
