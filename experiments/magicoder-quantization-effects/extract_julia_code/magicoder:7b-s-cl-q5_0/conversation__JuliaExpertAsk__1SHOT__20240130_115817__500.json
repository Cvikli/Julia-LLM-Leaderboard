Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    # Extract the content of each block and remove the fences\n    code_content = map(m -> m.captures[1], code_blocks)\n    \n    # Join all blocks together with newline\n    joined_code = join(code_content, \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nThis function works by using regular expressions to match and extract the content of each Julia code block from the provided markdown document `md`. It then joins these extracted pieces of code together with newline characters. \n\nRemember that this solution assumes that all Julia code blocks in your markdown file are properly formatted as triple backticks (````...```), which is a standard for indicating fenced code blocks in Markdown.","status":200,"tokens":[0,238],"elapsed":2.049511759,"_type":"aimessage"}]
