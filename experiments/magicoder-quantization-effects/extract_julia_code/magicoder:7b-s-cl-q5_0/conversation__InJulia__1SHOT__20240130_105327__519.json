It then filters out all elements that are not code blocks, and then joins these together with newline characters. The code inside each block is stripped of any fences using the replace function.\n\nPlease note that you should have the `Markdown` package installed in your Julia environment to use this function. You can install it via the Pkg REPL-mode with `]add Markdown`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,228],"elapsed":1.950672371,"_type":"aimessage"}]
