It then extracts each block of code as a separate string (which is collected in the `matches` variable), and appends those strings into an array called `codes`. The function `replace()` is used to remove newlines from the individual code blocks, and finally it uses `join()` to concatenate all the code blocks together with newline characters between each block.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n```julia\nprintln(\"Hello\")\n```\n```julia\nx = 5\ny = 10\nz = x + y\n```\n\"\"\"\nprintln(extract_julia_code(md))\n# Output: \"println(\\\"Hello\\\") x = 5 y = 10 z = x + y\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,326],"elapsed":2.802377023,"_type":"aimessage"}]
