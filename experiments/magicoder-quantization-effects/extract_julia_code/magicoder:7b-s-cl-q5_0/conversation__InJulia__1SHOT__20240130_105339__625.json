Here is a julia code block:\n```julia\nprintln(\"Hello from Julia\")\n```\nAnd here is another one:\n```julia\nfor i in 1:5\n    println(i)\nend\n```\n\"\"\"\nprint(extract_julia_code(md)) # Prints the cleaned julia code\n```\n\nPlease note that this function assumes you are passing a markdown document as a string. The `markdown` package is not needed for this simple example and wouldn't work if there were other non-julia language blocks in the document. If more complex handling of different languages or mixed language code blocks is required, then a more comprehensive solution would be needed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,348],"elapsed":3.006591085,"_type":"aimessage"}]
