Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The markdown document can be read as text using the `read` function in Julia, and then split into lines using the `splitlines` function. Each line is checked if it starts with ```julia - it indicates a code block.
