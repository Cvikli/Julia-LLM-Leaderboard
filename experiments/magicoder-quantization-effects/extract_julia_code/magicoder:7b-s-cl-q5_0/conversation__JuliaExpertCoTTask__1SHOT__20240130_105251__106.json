Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you might implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Find all code blocks using regular expressions.\n    matches = collect.(eachmatch(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, seed=0))\n    \n    code_blocks = String[]\n    for match in matches\n        # Remove the fences and join the lines together with a newline.\n        block = join([m[1] for m in eachmatch(r\"^.*$\", match)], \"\\n\")\n        \n        push!(code_blocks, block)\n    end\n    \n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by using a regular expression to match all the code blocks in the markdown document. It then removes the fences from each of these code blocks and joins them together with newline characters. The resulting string represents all the Julia code in the document, but without any surrounding whitespace or newlines.\n  \nNote that this solution assumes that there is only one language specified (in this case, \"julia\") in each code block, and also doesn't handle situations where more than one code block has to be combined together with a newline character (as the markdown standard does not allow for such cases).","status":200,"tokens":[0,291],"elapsed":2.513791243,"_type":"aimessage"}]
