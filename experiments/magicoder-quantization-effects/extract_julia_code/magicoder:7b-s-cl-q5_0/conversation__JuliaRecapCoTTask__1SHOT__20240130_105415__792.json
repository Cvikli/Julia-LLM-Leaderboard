[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Task \n\nThe function `extract_julia_code` is provided below:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    code = \"\"\n    in_block = false\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if startswith(line, '```') && !in_block\n            in_block = true\n        elseif in_block && endswith(line, '```')\n            in_block = false\n        elseif in_block \n            code *= chomp(line[3:end-3]) * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    return code\nend\n```\nIn this function, the for loop iterates over each line of the markdown document. If a line starts with ``` (which would indicate the beginning of a code block) and we are not already in a code block, then we set `in_block` to true. If a line ends with ``` and we are currently in a code block, then we know that this is the end of the current code block so we set `in_block` back to false. If `in_block` is true and it's not a line starting or ending with ``` then we add the contents of the line (minus the first 3 characters which are '```') to our code string, stripping any trailing newline character at the end using chomp.\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n1. The function assumes that there is only one set of triple backticks (`````) per block and that no code blocks contain nested code blocks. It does not handle the case where a line might start with ``` and end in the middle of another line's contents, or where multiple lines of code are separated by other than just newlines (e.g., tabs or spaces).\n2. The function also assumes that there is always a newline after each triple backticks. If this is not true, you would need to add additional logic to handle those cases.","status":200,"tokens":[11,429],"elapsed":3.821155879,"_type":"aimessage"}]
