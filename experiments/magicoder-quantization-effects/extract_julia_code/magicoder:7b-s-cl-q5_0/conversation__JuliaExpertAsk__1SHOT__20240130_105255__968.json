Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is how you might write this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Split the document into blocks by lines\n    code_blocks = split(md, '\\n')\n    \n    # Initialize an empty string to hold our output\n    outstr = \"\"\n    \n    # Iterate over each line in the document\n    for block in code_blocks\n        if startswith(block, '```julia') || startswith(block, '```' )\n            # If it's a code block, add it to our output after removing fencing and language type\n            outstr *= replace(block[6:end-3], '\\n', \" \") * \"\\n\"\n        elseif isempty(outstr) && !isempty(block) \n            # If it's not a code block but the document starts with non-code text, add this to our output\n            outstr = block[2:end]\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return outstr\nend\n```\nThis function works by first splitting the input markdown string `md` into an array of lines. It then iterates over each line in the document, and if it finds a line that starts with '```julia' or '```' (indicating a code block), it removes this prefix and suffix from the line and adds it to our output string. If the document does not start with a code block but contains non-code text, we add that to our output.\n\nPlease note that you need to handle possible cases where there are multiple consecutive code blocks or other edge cases. In addition, this function assumes that all code blocks are closed properly and do not contain nested code blocks. If your input could have these situations, you would need a more complex solution.","status":200,"tokens":[118,405],"elapsed":3.531419635,"_type":"aimessage"}]
