Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you might solve this problem using Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # Regex to match code blocks\n    pattern = r'```julia(.+?)```'\n    matches = re.findall(pattern, md, re.DOTALL)\n\n    # Join the matched strings and remove leading/trailing newline characters\n    joined_code = '\\n'.join(matches).strip()\n\n    return joined_code\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression to match all code blocks in the markdown document that are tagged as Julia. The `re.DOTALL` flag allows for matching across multiple lines. It then joins the matched strings together with newline characters, and removes any leading or trailing newline characters. \n\nPlease note that the given function assumes that all Julia code blocks in the provided Markdown document are correctly formatted and do not include any additional lines of text after the closing ``` tag. If there's a possibility that these conditions may not always be met, you might need to add some error checking or preprocessing logic to clean up the input.","status":200,"tokens":[0,249],"elapsed":2.138378831,"_type":"aimessage"}]
