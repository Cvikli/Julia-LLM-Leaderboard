Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can implement this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\"s\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(pattern, md, matchall=true))\n    code_blocks = mapreduce((m -> m.captures[1]), vcat, matches) do x \n        split(x, \"\\n\", keepempty = false)\n    end\n    join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThe function `extract_julia_code` uses the Regular Expression (regex) to match and capture all Julia code blocks from the markdown document. The pattern `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\"s matches any line starting with ```julia followed by anything until the next newline character, and this is captured in group 1. The matchall flag ensures that all matching blocks are returned as separate matches. \n\nThen it mapsreduce over the list of matches to split each block into individual lines and concatenate them together without empty lines, then join all code blocks together with a newline between each. \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that every Julia code block is separated by at least one blank line in your markdown document.","status":200,"tokens":[118,290],"elapsed":2.531969533,"_type":"aimessage"}]
