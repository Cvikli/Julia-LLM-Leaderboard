Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use regular expressions to match and extract code blocks from markdown files. Here is an example of how you could do this in Python:\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    pattern = r'```julia(.*?)```'\n    matches = re.findall(pattern, md, re.DOTALL)\n    code_blocks = [re.sub(r'```julia', '', match) for match in matches]\n    return '\\n'.join(code_blocks)\n```\nThe `extract_julia_code` function uses a regex pattern to find all occurrences of ```julia...``` code blocks in the markdown. The `.*?` inside the parentheses means \"match anything, but as few times as possible\". This is done with the `re.DOTALL` flag, which makes `findall` match across multiple lines.\n\nThe `sub` function is used to remove the ```julia...``` code block markers.\n\nFinally, all the extracted and cleaned code blocks are joined into a single string separated by newline characters with `'\\n'.join(code_blocks)`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,262],"elapsed":2.252716083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
