When it encounters a line that starts with ```julia or ends with ``` it knows that it's in/out of a code block. It then adds/removes all lines between these markers to the current code block, which is joined together at the end. The resulting string from the function is the combined code from all blocks, separated by newlines.\n\nThis does not provide any examples because as you've requested, the task is to create a function and not to solve an example problem. If you want an example of how this function could be used, here's a small program that reads a markdown file and prints out all code blocks:\n\n```julia\nfunction read_and_extract(file::String)\n    content = read(file, String)\n    extracted_code = extract_julia_code(content)\n    \n    println(\"Extracted Code:\")\n    print(extracted_code)\nend\n\nread_and_extract(\"path/to/your/markdown.md\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,471],"elapsed":4.079580059,"_type":"aimessage"}]
