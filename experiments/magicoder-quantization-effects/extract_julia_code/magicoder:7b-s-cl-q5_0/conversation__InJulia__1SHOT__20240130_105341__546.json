[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

It checks for both ```julia and ```python as these are common delimiters for markdown block quotes in different languages. Once it has identified the potential code blocks, it joins them together with a newline and removes any remaining code fences or leading/trailing whitespace. \n\nIt's worth noting that this function assumes the input is well-formed markdown containing julia or python language delimiters. If there are potential errors in the markdown (like mismatched quotes, or incorrect nesting of block quotes), it will likely produce incorrect results.","status":200,"tokens":[0,331],"elapsed":2.839955418,"_type":"aimessage"}]
