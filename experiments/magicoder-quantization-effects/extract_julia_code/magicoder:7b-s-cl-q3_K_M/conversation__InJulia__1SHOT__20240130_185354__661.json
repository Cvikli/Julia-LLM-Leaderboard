[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a way to achieve this using Regular Expressions:\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    blocks = split(md, \"\\n\\n\")  # split into code blocks\n    lines = String[]\n    for block in blocks\n        match = match(r\"```julia(.*?)```\", block)\n        if match !== nothing  # found a julia code block\n            code_block = match.captures[1]  # extract the code block\n            append!(lines, split(code_block, \"\\n\"))  # append lines to result\n        end\n    end\n    join(lines, \"\\n\")  # join with newline\nend\n```\nThis function first splits the given markdown document into its blocks. Then it iterates through each block and checks if it contains a julia code block. If found, extracts the code from inside fences and appends the lines to result. Finally it joins all the extracted lines together with newline character.\n\nPlease note that this function uses regular expressions which are case-sensitive, thus \"Julia\" will not be recognized as \"julia\". You may need to adjust the regular expression based on your needs.","status":200,"tokens":[0,276],"elapsed":2.136738447,"_type":"aimessage"}]
