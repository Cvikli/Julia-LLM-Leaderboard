Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is a function written in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all markdown code blocks\n    codes = collect(eachmatch(r\"```(.*?)(?=\\n)```\", md, captures=true))\n    \n    # Concatenate the captured strings and remove the extra newlines in between\n    result = join([join(collect(replace_all(c[1], r\"\\s{2,}\" => \" \"))) for c in codes]; \"\\n\")\n\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first finding all code blocks using regular expressions (the `eachmatch` function). Then, it iterates over the captures and joins them together. It also removes extra spaces using the `replace_all` function to ensure that there are no more than one space in between lines. \n\nPlease note this is a simple implementation which may not work as expected if your markdown documents contain any other special characters or syntax. You should make sure your inputs are formatted properly for the function to perform correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,239],"elapsed":1.836779061,"_type":"aimessage"}]
