Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how to write this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regex pattern that matches Julia code blocks in markdown format\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"ms\n\n    # Extract all matching strings, and join them with a newline\n    return join(collect(eachmatch(pattern, md)), \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nIn this function, we use the `eachmatch` function to find all matches of our pattern in the markdown document. It returns an iterator over Match objects for each match found. We then collect these into a Vector of Strings with `collect`. Each string represents one code block and we join them together using \"\\n\" (a newline character).\n\nThe \"ms\" flag at the end of our pattern makes it a \"multiline\" regex, allowing dots to also match newline characters. This is important for capturing all text between two arbitrary markers, even if they span multiple lines. Without this flag, `.` would not match newline characters. \n\nPlease note that the markdown format of the code blocks should follow the rule of ```julia\\n(your code)\\n``` to be correctly extracted.","status":200,"tokens":[0,276],"elapsed":2.149866699,"_type":"aimessage"}]
