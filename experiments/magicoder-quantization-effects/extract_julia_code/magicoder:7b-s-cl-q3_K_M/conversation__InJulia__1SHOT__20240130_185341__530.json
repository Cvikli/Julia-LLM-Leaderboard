It extracts these and removes the surrounding backticks (`), then trims any leading or trailing white space from each block. The trimmed blocks are then joined together with newline characters.\n\nPlease note that it will only capture Julia code blocks surrounded by ```julia\\n (without spaces) at start and end of block, not python code blocks with Python3 or other languages. If you want to extract all code blocks regardless the language used, you need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[122,239],"elapsed":8.628821696,"_type":"aimessage"}]
