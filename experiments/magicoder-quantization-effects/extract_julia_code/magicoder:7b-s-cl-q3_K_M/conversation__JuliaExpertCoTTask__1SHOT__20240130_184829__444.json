[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function `extract_julia_code` that matches your description:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # find all code blocks in markdown document\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia(.*?)```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    if isempty(code_blocks)\n        return \"\"\n    else\n        code = join([replace(block.captures[1], \"\\n\" => \"\") for block in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n        return code\n    end\nend\n```\nThe function `extract_julia_code` matches all Julia blocks from the provided markdown, and joins them together with newline characters. It uses a regular expression to find all ```julia...``` blocks in the markdown document, then removes newlines inside each block using the `replace()` function. If no code blocks are found, an empty string is returned instead.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the provided markdown document `md` is a single string containing markdown and Julia language code blocks. It does not handle multiple strings or other complex scenarios.","status":200,"tokens":[0,261],"elapsed":2.014764216,"_type":"aimessage"}]
