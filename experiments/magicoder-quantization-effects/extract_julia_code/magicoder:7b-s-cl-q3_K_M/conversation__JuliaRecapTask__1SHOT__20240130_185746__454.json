[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can create such function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    code_blocks = String[]\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, '`') && endswith(line, '`') \n            code_block = replace(line[2:end-1], \"`\" => \"\")\n            push!(code_blocks, code_block)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the markdown string into lines and then iterating over those lines. If a line starts with backticks (which denotes a code block in markdown) and ends with backticks, it removes them and adds the resulting code to an array. Finally, it joins all of the code blocks together with newline characters between each one.\n  \nPlease note that this function does not account for nested backticks within a code block or other complications of markdown syntax. Also, this function will only work if the provided input is indeed markdown with Julia language code blocks. For more sophisticated parsing, you might want to use an actual markdown parser library, like `Markdown` in Julia's `Pkg`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,297],"elapsed":2.372252631,"_type":"aimessage"}]
