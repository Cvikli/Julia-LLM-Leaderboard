Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you might implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    pattern = r'```julia(.+?)```'\n    matches = re.findall(pattern, md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    return \"\\n\".join([match.strip() for match in matches])\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression to match all the blocks of code. It looks for text between three backticks (```), followed by 'julia', and captures everything between them with `(.+?)`. The `re.DOTALL` flag makes the dot (.) in the pattern match any character, including newline.\n\nIt then joins all the matches together using a newline as the separator. The `strip()` method is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace that might have been included with the code block. \n\nThis function will return all of the Julia code blocks from the markdown document, concatenated with newlines between each block. If there are multiple code blocks, they will be joined into a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,246],"elapsed":1.929929325,"_type":"aimessage"}]
