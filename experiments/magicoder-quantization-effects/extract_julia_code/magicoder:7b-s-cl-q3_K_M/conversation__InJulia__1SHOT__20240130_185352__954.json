We use regular expression to find these blocks, which are defined between three backticks (```). The `.*?` part of our regex means that we want a non-greedy match (i.e., as short as possible) within these three backticks.\n\nThen we create an array `code_blocks` that contains the matched blocks, and convert it to a String array with `join`.\n\nFinally, we remove all leading and trailing white spaces from each block using `strip`, concatenate them with newline characters (`\\n`) between each pair of blocks, and return the final result as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,266],"elapsed":2.058372889,"_type":"aimessage"}]
