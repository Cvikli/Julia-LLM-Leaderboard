If it encounters a code block fence (which is indicated by three backticks on either side of the line), it starts or ends a code block section. All lines in that code block are added to a separate array. When it finds an end block, it adds the contents of that block to the list of blocks and continues with the next line.\n\nNote: This function assumes that each code block is on its own line without any other content (like comments or headers) mixed in between the start and end code fences. It also doesn't handle nested code blocks. You may need to modify it for your specific use case, if you're dealing with different types of markdown documents or more complex cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,407],"elapsed":3.126940089,"_type":"aimessage"}]
