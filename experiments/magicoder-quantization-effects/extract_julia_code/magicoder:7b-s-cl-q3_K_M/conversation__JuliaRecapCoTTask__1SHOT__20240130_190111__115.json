[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem, I'll write a function `extract_julia_code` that uses the GitHub Markdown parser library called \"Markdown\" in Julia. This library can parse and manipulate markdown documents including code blocks. We will use the function `parse_blocks` from the library to split the markdown into blocks, then extract the relevant code blocks.\n\nPlease install the necessary packages first by running the following command:\n```julia\nPkg.add(\"Markdown\")\n```\nThen you can define your function as follows:\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    blocks = parse_blocks(md)\n    jl_code_blocks = filter(b -> startswith(lowercase(strip(b.language)), \"julia\"), blocks)\n    join([replace(b.code, r\"```\" => \"\") for b in jl_code_blocks]; '\\n')\nend\n```\nThis function goes through all the blocks of a markdown document and selects those with \"Julia\" as their language. It then removes code fences from each block of code and joins them together into one string, separating blocks by a newline character. \n\nIn the filter function we're using the `startswith` function to check if the language of a block starts with \"julia\", case-insensitive (`lowercase`), and stripped of leading/trailing whitespaces (`strip`). This is because some markdown editors can include extra spaces or capitalization in the language field.\n\nThe `replace(b.code, r\"```\" => \"\")` removes any remaining code fences from the block. The backslashes are escaped to prevent interpolation by Julia's string literals (`\\`` -> `\"\\\"\"`) and replace function is then applied on each block of code (`b.code`).\n\nFinally, we join all selected blocks into one string with a newline character (`'\\n') as the separator, thus creating a single string containing all julia code blocks from the input markdown document.","status":200,"tokens":[0,458],"elapsed":3.662461339,"_type":"aimessage"}]
