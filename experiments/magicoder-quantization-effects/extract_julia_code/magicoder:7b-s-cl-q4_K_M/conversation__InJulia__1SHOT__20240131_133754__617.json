The result is returned as a String. \n\nPlease note that the regular expression used in this solution assumes that there are no other backticks (``) in your markdown document. If there might be, you would need to adjust the regex accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,220],"elapsed":1.748371826,"_type":"aimessage"}]
