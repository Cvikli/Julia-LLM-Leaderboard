Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution in Julia programming language:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=RegexSeed()))\n    \n    # Join the code blocks together with newline\n    joined_code = join([block.captures[1] for block in blocks], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all Julia language code blocks in the markdown document and then concatenates them together. Note that it assumes that each code block is separated by two newline characters (`\\n\\n`). If your markdown format is different, you might need to adjust this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[118,184],"elapsed":1.492816074,"_type":"aimessage"}]
