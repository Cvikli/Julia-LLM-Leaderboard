Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution using the `markdown` library:\n\n```python\nimport markdown\nfrom markdown import Markdown\nfrom markdown.extensions.codehilite import CodeHiliteExtension, CodeHilite\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    md = markdown.Markdown(extensions=[CodeHiliteExtension(guess_lang=False)])\n    code_blocks = [node for node in md.parser.parse(md) if isinstance(node, CodeHilite)]\n    return '\\n'.join([node.literal.strip() for node in code_blocks])\n```\n\nThis function works by creating a markdown parser with the `CodeHiliteExtension` enabled (which allows it to recognize and parse code blocks). It then parses the input markdown string, collecting all the nodes that are instances of `CodeHilite`, which represents a code block. The `literal` attribute of each node is the actual code text, so we strip any leading or trailing whitespace from this and join them together with newline characters to get the final result.\n\nPlease note that you need to install the markdown library if it's not installed yet via pip:\n```shell\npip install markdown\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,281],"elapsed":2.211264614,"_type":"aimessage"}]
