It then joins these together with a newline and removes any remaining backticks (which were used for marking up the code in the original Markdown). \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is only one language specified after ```` in each block, and that it's \"julia\". If you want to handle other languages or have more complex requirements, you would need to modify the regular expression or add additional logic.","status":200,"tokens":[0,247],"elapsed":1.931973212,"_type":"aimessage"}]
