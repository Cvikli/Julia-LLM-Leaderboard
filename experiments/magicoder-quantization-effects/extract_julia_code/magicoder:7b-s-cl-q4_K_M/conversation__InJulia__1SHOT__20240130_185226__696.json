[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of this problem in Julia:\n```Julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all blocks of code\n    blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seperators=true))\n    \n    # If there are no code blocks return an empty string\n    if isempty(blocks)\n        return \"\"\n    end\n\n    # Remove code fences and join the blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = reduce((a,b)->a * \"\\n\" * b.match[2], blocks)[end]\n    \n    # Return as a String\n    return string(joined_code)\nend\n```\nIn this function, we first find all the Julia code blocks using regular expressions (the `eachmatch` function in Julia). We then remove the code fences and join the blocks together with newlines. \n\nThe function finally returns the joined code as a string. If there are no code blocks, it returns an empty string.\n\nPlease note that this will only work correctly if the julia code is properly indented using spaces or tabs in the markdown document. The regex used to extract the code assumes the code starts on a new line after ```julia\\n and ends before another block of code or at the end of the string. Also, it removes all new lines inside the blocks. If you want to keep newline characters use `m.match[2]` instead of `m.captures[1]`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,338],"elapsed":2.702636918,"_type":"aimessage"}]
