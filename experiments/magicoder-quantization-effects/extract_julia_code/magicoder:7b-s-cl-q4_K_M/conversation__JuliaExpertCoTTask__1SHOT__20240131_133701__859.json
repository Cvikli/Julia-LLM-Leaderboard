The first group `(.*?)` specifies the language (in this case, julia), and the second group `(.*?)` captures the actual code block.\n\nThe `join` function combines all the captured code blocks with newline characters between them.\n\nYou can test this function using your example:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\"\nprintln(extract_julia_code(md)) # \"println(\\\"hello world\\\")\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,271],"elapsed":2.177352605,"_type":"aimessage"}]
