[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might solve this problem using Julia's built-in regular expression module:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    code = join([block.captures[1] for block in blocks], \"\\n\")\n    return replace(code, r\"^```julia$\" => \"\")\nend\n```\nThis function works by using a regular expression to match the pattern of a Julia code block surrounded by three backticks (`` ` `` ). It then collects all matches and concatenates them together with newline characters. The `replace` function is used to remove any remaining code fences at the end or beginning of the string.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that there are no other code blocks in your markdown document, and it also assumes that there will never be a line break inside a Julia code block. If these assumptions do not hold true for your use case, you may need to adjust the regular expression or add additional logic to handle these edge cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,256],"elapsed":2.072786241,"_type":"aimessage"}]
