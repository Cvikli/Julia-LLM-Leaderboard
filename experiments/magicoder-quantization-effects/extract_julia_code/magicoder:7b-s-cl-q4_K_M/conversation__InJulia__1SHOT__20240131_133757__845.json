[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can implement this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using the regular expression `^````(.+?)`````$\n    matches = eachmatch(r\"```(.+?)```\", md, 1);\n    \n    # Initialize an empty string to hold the extracted code\n    result = \"\"\n\n    # Iterate over all matches and concatenate their contents to result\n    for match in matches\n        code_block = match.captures[1];\n        result *= replace(code_block, \"\\n\" => \" \") * \"\\n\";\n    end\n    \n    return result;\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first finding all occurrences of the code block pattern (`^````(.+?)`````$) in the markdown document. It then iterates over these matches, concatenating each captured code block to a string `result`. The newline characters are replaced with spaces within each code block to prevent formatting issues when concatenating them.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that there is only one level of indentation (i.e., no nested code blocks) in the markdown document. If your documents can have nested code blocks, you will need a more complex parsing strategy.","status":200,"tokens":[0,291],"elapsed":2.316226535,"_type":"aimessage"}]
