It then concatenates these code blocks into one string, removing any code fencing (the three backticks) that were originally present. The resulting string is returned by the function. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that each code block starts with ````julia` and ends with `\\n````. If your markdown document uses different conventions for indicating code blocks, you would need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[88,223],"elapsed":1.772659405,"_type":"aimessage"}]
