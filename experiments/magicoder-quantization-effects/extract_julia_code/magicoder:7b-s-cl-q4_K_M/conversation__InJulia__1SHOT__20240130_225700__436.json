The regular expression `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\" is used to match the code fences.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no nested code blocks in your markdown document. If you have nested code blocks, you would need a more complex solution that can handle nesting, which would require a proper parser for markdown rather than just using regular expressions.","status":200,"tokens":[0,250],"elapsed":1.958610695,"_type":"aimessage"}]
