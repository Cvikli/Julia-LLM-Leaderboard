Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple Python solution to your problem:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```(.*?)```', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline and remove code fences\n    joined_code = '\\n'.join(code_blocks).replace('```', '')\n    \n    return joined_code\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all occurrences of code blocks in the markdown document. The `re.DOTALL` flag is used to make `.` match any character including newline. \n\nThe `findall()` method returns a list of all non-overlapping matches of pattern in string, as a list of strings. If one or more groups are present in the pattern, return a list of groups; this will be a list of tuples if there are multiple groups. \n\nThe `.replace('```', '')` is used to remove the code fences from the code blocks.\n\nFinally, the `'\\n'.join(code_blocks)` joins all the code blocks together with a newline.","status":200,"tokens":[0,275],"elapsed":2.161683033,"_type":"aimessage"}]
