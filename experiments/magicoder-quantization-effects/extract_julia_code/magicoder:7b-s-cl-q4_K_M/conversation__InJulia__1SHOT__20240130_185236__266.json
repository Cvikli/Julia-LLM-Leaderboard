It then extracts the corresponding block of code, removes the surrounding fences, joins them together with a newline, and returns the result as a string. Note that this assumes no error checking or handling for cases where the code blocks do not have matching start and end delimiters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,398],"elapsed":3.24756791,"_type":"aimessage"}]
