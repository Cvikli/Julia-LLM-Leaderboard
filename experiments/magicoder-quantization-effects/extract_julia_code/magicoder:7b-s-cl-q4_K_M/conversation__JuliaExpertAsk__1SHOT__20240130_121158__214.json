Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of your request:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    pattern = r'```julia\\n(.*?)```'\n    matches = re.findall(pattern, md, re.DOTALL)  # DOTALL to make . match any character including newline\n    \n    if len(matches) > 0:\n        code_blocks = [match for match in matches if \"```\" not in match]\n        return '\\n'.join(code_blocks)\n    else:\n        return \"\"\n```\n\nThis function uses the `re` module to find all occurrences of a string that matches the pattern `r'```julia\\n(.*?)```'`. The `.*?` inside the pattern is a non-greedy matcher, which means it will stop matching as soon as possible. The `re.DOTALL` flag allows the dot (.) to match any character including newline.\n\nIf there are no matches, an empty string is returned. If there are matches, each of them is checked if they contain a code fence (another occurrence of ```). If they don't have it, they're added to the `code_blocks` list. These blocks are then joined together with newline characters and returned as a String.","status":200,"tokens":[0,295],"elapsed":2.381285447,"_type":"aimessage"}]
