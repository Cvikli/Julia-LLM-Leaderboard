[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how to solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, capture=2))\n    \n    # If there are no code blocks, return an empty string\n    if isempty(matches)\n        return \"\"\n    end\n    \n    # Combine all the code blocks into a single string\n    code = join([match for match in matches], \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Remove any leading or trailing whitespace from each line of code\n    code = replace.(split(code, '\\n'), r\"^\\s*\" => \"\", r\"\\s*$\" => \"\")\n    \n    return join(code, '\\n')\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by using regular expressions to find all the Julia code blocks in the markdown document. It then joins these blocks together with a newline character and removes any leading or trailing whitespace from each line of code. If there are no code blocks, it simply returns an empty string. \n\nNote that this function assumes that the input `md` is a string containing the markdown document.","status":200,"tokens":[0,275],"elapsed":2.250316871,"_type":"aimessage"}]
