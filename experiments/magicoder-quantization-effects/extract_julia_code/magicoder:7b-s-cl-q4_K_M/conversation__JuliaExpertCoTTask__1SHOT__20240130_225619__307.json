The `eachmatch` function returns an iterator over matches, and we collect these into a list. Then for each block, we replace the code fence characters with nothing (`\"\"`), and join them together with newline characters.\n\nYou can test this function using your example:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\"\nprint(extract_julia_code(md)) # prints \"println(\\\"hello world\\\")\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[254,265],"elapsed":14.419746326,"_type":"aimessage"}]
