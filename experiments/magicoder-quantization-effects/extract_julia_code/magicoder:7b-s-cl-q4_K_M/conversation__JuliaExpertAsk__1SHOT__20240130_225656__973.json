Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of the function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regex\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    # Join the code blocks together with newline\n    code = join([match.captures[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression to find all occurrences of Julia code blocks (```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```) and then joins them together with newline characters. Note that the `.*?` is a non-greedy match, meaning it will stop matching as soon as possible (before reaching the end of the block).\n\nNote: This function assumes that there are no nested code blocks or other special cases in your markdown document. If you have such cases, you'd need to adjust this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,226],"elapsed":1.774646054,"_type":"aimessage"}]
