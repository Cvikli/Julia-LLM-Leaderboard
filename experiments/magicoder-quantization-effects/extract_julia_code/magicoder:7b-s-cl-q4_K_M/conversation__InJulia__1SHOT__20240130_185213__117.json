[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is an example of how you could solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    matches = eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\", md, 1)\n    if length(matches) == 0 # No code blocks found\n        return \"\"\n    end\n    \n    # Extract and join all Julia code lines\n    code_lines = String[];\n    for match in matches\n        push!(code_lines, match.captures[1])\n    end\n    \n    # Remove code fences from the code lines\n    cleaned_code = replace.(cleanup(code_lines), \"`\" => \"\")\n    \n    # Join all code lines into a single string with newline characters\n    result = join(cleaned_code, \"\\n\")\n\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, `eachmatch` is used to find all occurrences of the regular expression pattern inside the markdown document. This pattern matches Julia-fenced code blocks (`\"```) and captures the content inside them. The `join` function then combines these contents into a single string with newline characters between each block.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no other types of fences within your markdown document, only Julia ones. If you have different type of fence like ```` ````` or ~~~ ~~~, you'll need to adjust the regex pattern accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[122,340],"elapsed":30.243735668,"_type":"aimessage"}]
