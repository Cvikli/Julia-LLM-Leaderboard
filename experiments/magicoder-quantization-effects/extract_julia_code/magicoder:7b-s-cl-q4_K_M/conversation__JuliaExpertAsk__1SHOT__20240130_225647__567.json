Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple Python solution using regular expressions:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # regex pattern to match code blocks\n    pattern = r'```(.*?)```'\n    \n    matches = re.findall(pattern, md, re.DOTALL)  # find all matches and include newlines\n    \n    # remove code fences (``` )\n    cleaned_matches = [match[3:-3] for match in matches]\n    \n    # join the code blocks with a newline\n    joined_code = '\\n'.join(cleaned_matches)\n    \n    return joined_code\n```\n\nThis function works by first using regular expressions to find all code blocks in the markdown document. It then removes the ``` and ``` from each block, and finally joins them together with a newline character.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that there are no other characters within the code blocks apart from Julia language code. If your markdown contains other special characters (like comments or other formatting), you might need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,242],"elapsed":1.900769237,"_type":"aimessage"}]
