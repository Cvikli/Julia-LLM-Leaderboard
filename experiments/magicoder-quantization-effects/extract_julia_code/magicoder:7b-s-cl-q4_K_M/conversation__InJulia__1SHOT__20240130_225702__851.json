[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regex\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\", md, capture=2))\n    \n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    code = join([strip(m, '\\n') for m in matches], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all occurrences of code blocks in the markdown document. It then removes the code fences and joins the code blocks together with a newline. The `collect` function is used to convert the iterator returned by `eachmatch` into an array, which allows us to use array methods like `join`.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that all code blocks in your markdown document are Julia code blocks. If there could be other types of code blocks or if they could be indented (which would cause the regular expression to not match), you may need a more complex solution.","status":200,"tokens":[0,239],"elapsed":1.872536292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
