[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks and remove the fences\n    code_blocks = replace.(collect(eachmatch(r\"```(.*?)```\", md, seperators=[\"\"])), r\"^```|```$\"=>\"\")\n    \n    # Join all the code blocks into one string with newline separators\n    combined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\n    \n    return combined_code\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to find and replace all instances of the code fences (three backticks ```) surrounding a block of Julia code. Then it joins together all of these blocks with newline separators (`\"\\n\\n\"`). The `collect` function is used to create an array from all matches, and `eachmatch` function returns an iterator that produces matches.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the code fences are properly balanced, i.e., there will never be a closing fence without a corresponding opening one. If your markdown can have unbalanced fences, you'll need to add additional checks and logic to handle them correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,271],"elapsed":2.221626601,"_type":"aimessage"}]
