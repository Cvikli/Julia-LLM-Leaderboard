[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

This pattern matches a block of text that starts with three backticks (```), followed by \"julia\", and ends with another set of three backticks. The `.*?` inside the parentheses is a non-greedy match, meaning it will stop matching as soon as possible to match the entire string. \n\nFor each code block, we replace all instances of \"`\" with \"\" using the `replace!` function. This is necessary because the code blocks are surrounded by backticks (`) and we want to keep the actual Julia code intact.\n\nFinally, we join the extracted code blocks together into a single string, separating each block with newline characters. We use the `parse_multiline_string` function from REPLCompletions module which is used for parsing multiline strings. \n\nThis function does not provide any examples because the problem statement explicitly stated that it doesn't provide any examples.","status":200,"tokens":[388,387],"elapsed":3.235752317,"_type":"aimessage"}]
