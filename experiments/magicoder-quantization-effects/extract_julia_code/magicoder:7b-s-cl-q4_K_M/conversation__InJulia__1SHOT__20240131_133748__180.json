It extracts the content of these blocks and removes the surrounding fences (both backticks and newline). The extracted code is then joined together with a newline character, effectively creating one long string of concatenated code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[0,206],"elapsed":1.633922573,"_type":"aimessage"}]
