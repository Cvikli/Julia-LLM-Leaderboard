Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia function to solve this problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    parsed = parse_raw(md, :html)\n    blocks = []\n    for (i, el) in enumerate(parsed.content)\n        if el isa HTML.Tag && el.name == \"code\" && occursin(\"julia\", el.attributes[\"class\"]) \n            push!(blocks, String(el.text))\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join([replace(b, r\"\\n+\", \"\\n\") for b in blocks], \"\\n\\n\") # remove extra newlines\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `Markdown.jl` package to parse the markdown document and then extracts all Julia code blocks from it. It iterates over each element parsed from the markdown, checks if it is a code block with \"julia\" in its class attribute, and appends the text of this block (stripped of HTML tags) into an array `blocks`.\n\nAfterwards, we join all these blocks together (with newline characters between each pair), removing any excessive number of newlines. Note that we also replace occurrences of one or more sequential newline characters with a single newline character using the `replace` function.\n\nThe function finally returns this concatenated string. \n\nPlease note, you must have Markdown package installed in your Julia environment to run this function. If it's not installed, run `Pkg.add(\"Markdown\")` in your Julia console before trying this function.","status":200,"tokens":[161,354],"elapsed":17.922768009,"_type":"aimessage"}]
