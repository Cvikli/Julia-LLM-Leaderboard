The \"?\" after \"*\" makes it non-greedy, so it will match up to the first \"`\" it encounters rather than all the way to the end of the string.\n\nThe resulting blocks are then joined together with a newline character (\"\\n\"), and this combined string is returned by the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,259],"elapsed":2.028430354,"_type":"aimessage"}]
