[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String) \n    blocks = []\n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        if startswith(line, '`' ) && endswith(line, '`')\n            push!(blocks, chomp(line[2:end-1]))\n        elseif length(blocks) > 0 && !startswith(line, '```')\n            blocks[end] *= '\\n' * chomp(line)\n        end\n    end\n    return join(blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each line in the provided markdown document. If it encounters a line that starts and ends with backticks (code fences), it adds the content of that code block to the `blocks` array. If the line does not start or end with backticks, but we have already encountered at least one code block, it appends the current line to the last code block in the `blocks` array. Finally, if there is more than one code block and a non-code line follows, it appends that line to the last code block. The function then joins all of the blocks together with newlines and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,302],"elapsed":2.471925153,"_type":"aimessage"}]
