Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can achieve this using regular expressions in Julia. It assumes that each code block starts with a line containing three backticks ` ```, and ends with the same sequence.\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```(.*?)```\", md, count=false))\n    \n    # Extract and join each block into one string\n    code_blocks = [join(split(match.captures[1], '\\n'), \" \") for match in matches]\n\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function first identifies all instances of the Julia code blocks (i.e., chunks enclosed by ` ``` and matching pairs of ` ```) using the `eachmatch` function on a regular expression pattern. Each match is then collected into an array.\n\nFor each match, the captured text (inside the backticks) is split into an array of lines by newline (`'\\n'`). The lines are joined back together with a space character to remove the newlines. \n\nFinally, all blocks are joined together with a newline. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that Julia code blocks do not contain further backticks, and also does not handle nested or adjacent code blocks properly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,301],"elapsed":2.434650578,"_type":"aimessage"}]
