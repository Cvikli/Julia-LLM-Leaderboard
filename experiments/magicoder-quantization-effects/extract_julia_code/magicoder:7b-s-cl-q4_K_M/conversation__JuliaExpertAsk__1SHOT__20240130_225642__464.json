Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem using regular expressions:\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seperators=[\"\\n\"])) do match\n        return match.captures[1]\n    end\n    \n    joined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    # Remove code fences (i.e., ```julia)\n    cleaned_code = replace(joined_code, r\"```julia\\n\" => \"\")\n    \n    return cleaned_code\nend\n```\nThis function first uses `eachmatch` to find all occurrences of the code block pattern in the markdown document. It then collects these matches into an array and concatenates them together with newline characters. The resulting string is stripped of its code fence markers.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that each Julia code block ends with a newline character, which is standard practice in markdown files. If this assumption does not hold true for your input data, you may need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,270],"elapsed":2.117592766,"_type":"aimessage"}]
