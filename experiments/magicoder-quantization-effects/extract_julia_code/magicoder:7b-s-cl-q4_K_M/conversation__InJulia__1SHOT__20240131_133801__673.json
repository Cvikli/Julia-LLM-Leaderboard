The result is a list of matches, where each match is a tuple with two elements: 1) the whole matched string (including the ```julia\\n and \\n```); and 2) the captured part (i.e., the actual Julia code). We then extract these parts into `code_blocks`.\n\nFinally, we join all the code blocks together with a newline character using the `join` function and return the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,248],"elapsed":1.972333592,"_type":"aimessage"}]
