[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

The `greedy=false` argument is used to make sure that the `.+?` part of the regex doesn't match across multiple code blocks.\n\nThe contents of each match are then joined together with a newline character, and this resulting string is returned by the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,223],"elapsed":1.765425362,"_type":"aimessage"}]
