Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution for your problem using regular expressions:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```julia(.+?)```', md, re.DOTALL)\n    return '\\n'.join(code_blocks)\n```\n\nThis function uses the `re` module in Python to find all occurrences of a string enclosed between three backticks (```), with 'julia' as the second argument. The `re.DOTALL` flag makes the dot (.) in the regular expression match any character, including newline characters.\n\nThe function then returns all found code blocks joined by newlines. If there are no code blocks or only one block is present, it will return an empty string or a single code block respectively.","status":200,"tokens":[0,188],"elapsed":1.473794496,"_type":"aimessage"}]
