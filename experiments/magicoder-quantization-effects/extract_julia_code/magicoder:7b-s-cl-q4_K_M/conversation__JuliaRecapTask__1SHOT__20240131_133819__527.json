[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this task:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seperator= \"\\n\"))\n    \n    # Extract the code from each match and remove the fences\n    codes = [match.captures[1] for match in matches]\n    \n    # Join all the codes together with a newline\n    joined_code = join(codes, \"\\n\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all code blocks in the markdown document. It then extracts the actual code from each match and removes the fences (the backticks surrounding the language and the code). Finally, it joins all these codes together with a newline character.","status":200,"tokens":[0,206],"elapsed":1.67647287,"_type":"aimessage"}]
