[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise.

Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    blocks = split(md, \"\\n\\n\") # Split the markdown into code blocks\n    code_blocks = filter(b -> startswith(b, \"```julia\"), blocks) # Filter out non-Julia code blocks\n    cleaned_blocks = map(strip, code_blocks) # Remove leading/trailing whitespace from each block\n    joined_code = join([replace(b, r\"^```julia\\n|\\n```$\" => \"\") for b in cleaned_blocks], \"\\n\") # Join the blocks together and remove fences\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the markdown into individual code blocks (separated by two consecutive newlines), filtering out any blocks that aren't Julia-specific, removing leading/trailing whitespace from each block, and joining all of the remaining blocks together with a newline. The `replace` function is used to remove the language indicator (````julia`) at the start and end of each code block.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that there's only one level of indentation in your markdown file (i.e., no nested code blocks). If you have multiple levels of indentation, you might need a more complex solution to handle that.","status":200,"tokens":[0,314],"elapsed":2.473790228,"_type":"aimessage"}]
