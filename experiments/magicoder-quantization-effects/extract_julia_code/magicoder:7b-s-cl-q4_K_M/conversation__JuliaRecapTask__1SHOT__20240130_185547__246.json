[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function in Julia language to extract julia code from markdown. This function uses Regex (Regular Expressions) and the Parsing.Parse function in Base Julia package to find and extract the code blocks. \n\n```julia\nimport REPL: softspace\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regular expressions\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\", md,  greedy=false))\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the combined julia code.\n    jl_code = \"\"\n\n    # Iterate through each match found in the markdown file and extract the Julia code.\n    for match in matches\n        # Add a newline after every block of code except the last one,\n        # This is done to ensure that all the blocks of code are separated by a newline. \n        jl_code *= strip(match[1], ['\\n']) * (match == last(matches) ? \"\" : \"\\n\")\n    end\n\n    return jl_code\nend\n```\nThis function works by first finding all the Julia code blocks in your Markdown file, and then iterating through each match. It extracts each match using a regular expression to find ```julia\\n(.*?)``` and appends this to `jl_code`, with a newline (\\n) added after each block of code except for the last one.\n  \nThis function assumes that all Julia code blocks in your Markdown file are properly formatted as fenced code blocks (i.e., ```julia\\ncode goes here\\n``` ). If this is not the case, you might want to add additional error checking or cleanup to handle improperly formatted blocks of code.\n\nThis function also assumes that your Markdown file uses a Unix-style line endings (i.e., `\\n` for newline). If it uses Windows-style line endings (`\\r\\n`), you would need to modify the regular expression to match this. \n  \nRemember, markdown is just text, so this function won't handle other types of special characters or formatting within code blocks (like comments), only the basic block of Julia code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,495],"elapsed":4.10217243,"_type":"aimessage"}]
