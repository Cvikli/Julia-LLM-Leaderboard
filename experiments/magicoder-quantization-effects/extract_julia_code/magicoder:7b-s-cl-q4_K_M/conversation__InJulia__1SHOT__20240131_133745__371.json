It also handles multiple code blocks by joining them with a newline character. \n\nNote: This function assumes that all Julia code blocks do not contain backticks (which are used for code fencing). If your input markdown can have backticks within code blocks, you would need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[88,261],"elapsed":2.100686426,"_type":"aimessage"}]
