[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem by using regular expressions to match and extract the Julia code blocks from the markdown document. The `eachmatch` function allows you to loop over all matches in a string, the `captures` method returns an array of captures made during the matching process. Below is a possible implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\"s\n    matches = eachmatch(pattern, md)\n    code = \"\"\n    for m in matches\n        block = replace(m.captures[1], \"\\n\" => \" \"; strip=true) # remove newlines and leading/trailing whitespace\n        code *= \"$block\\n\" # append to the end of `code`\n    end\n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function will match any block of text surrounded by triple backticks (```) that ends with `julia`. It then removes newlines and leading/trailing white spaces from each matched block. Finally, it concatenates all the blocks into one single string separated by newline characters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,248],"elapsed":2.095977764,"_type":"aimessage"}]
