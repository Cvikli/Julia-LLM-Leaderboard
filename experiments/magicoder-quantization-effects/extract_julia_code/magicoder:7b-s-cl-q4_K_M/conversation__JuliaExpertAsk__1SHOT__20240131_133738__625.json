Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution using BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML:\n\n```python\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(md, 'html.parser')\n    \n    code_blocks = [re.sub('^```.*', '', str(block)) for block in soup.findAll('code')]\n    joined_code = '\\n'.join(code_blocks)\n    \n    return joined_code\n```\n\nThis function works by first parsing the markdown document `md` with BeautifulSoup, which allows it to find all `<code>` tags (which are used for code blocks in markdown). It then strips off the three backticks surrounding each block of code and joins them together into a single string. \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the input `md` is already properly formatted as HTML, which may not be the case if it's straight from a markdown file. For a more robust solution, you would need to convert your markdown to HTML first using something like Pandoc or similar.","status":200,"tokens":[0,248],"elapsed":1.975133405,"_type":"aimessage"}]
