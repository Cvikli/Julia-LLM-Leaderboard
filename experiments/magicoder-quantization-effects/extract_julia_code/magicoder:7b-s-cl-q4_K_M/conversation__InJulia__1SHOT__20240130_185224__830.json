[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple way to do this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    start = 0\n    code = \"\"\n    for (i, line) in enumerate(eachline(IOBuffer(md)))\n        if occursin(\"```julia\", line)\n            if start == 0\n                start = i\n            else\n                append!(code, read(IOBuffer(md[(start+1):end-1)]))\n                return code\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return \"\"\nend\n```\nThis function reads the markdown document `md` line by line. If it encounters a line that begins with \"```julia\", it starts collecting lines into the variable `code`. When it hits another \"```\" line, it has finished collecting the code block and returns it. Note that this doesn't handle nested Julia code blocks or other kinds of fencing in markdown files. It also assumes that all julia code blocks end with \"```\". If you want more sophisticated handling, you would need to modify this function significantly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,251],"elapsed":1.998531029,"_type":"aimessage"}]
