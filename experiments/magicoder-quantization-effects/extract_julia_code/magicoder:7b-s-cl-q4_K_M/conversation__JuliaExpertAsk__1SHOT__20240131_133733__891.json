Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can achieve this using Julia:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all julia code blocks in the markdown document\n    julia_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = join([m.captures[1] for m in julia_blocks], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all code blocks marked as Julia (```julia\\n...\\n```) and extract the content of these blocks. The `join` function is then used to concatenate these blocks with a newline character between each block.","status":200,"tokens":[0,186],"elapsed":1.478581811,"_type":"aimessage"}]
