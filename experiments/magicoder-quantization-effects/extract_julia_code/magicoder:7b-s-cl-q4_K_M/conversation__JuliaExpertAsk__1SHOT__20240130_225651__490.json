Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution using regular expressions:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```(.*?)```', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # Remove code fences from each block and join them into one string with newline\n    joined_code = '\\n'.join([re.sub(r'^```|```$', '', block).strip() for block in code_blocks])\n    \n    return joined_code\n```\n\nThis function works by first using `re.findall` to find all occurrences of strings enclosed between three backticks (```), and capturing the contents of these blocks with `re.DOTALL` to make `.` match any character including newline. \n\nThen, it uses a list comprehension to iterate over each block, remove the code fences at both ends using `re.sub`, and strip leading/trailing whitespaces from each line. Finally, it joins all blocks into one string with newline characters between them using `.join`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,254],"elapsed":1.996536721,"_type":"aimessage"}]
