Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can solve this problem using regular expressions in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks\n    blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seperator=true))\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    code = reduce((x, y) -> x * \"\\n\" * pop!(y.captures), map(x->replace(x.match, r\"```julia\\n|\\n```\"=>\"\"), blocks))\n    \n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function works by first using `eachmatch` to find all occurrences of the pattern \"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\". This will match the entire code block including the fences, and split it into two captures: the \"julia\" part and the actual code.\n\nThe function then removes the code fences from each code block using `replace` and joins them together with a newline character. Finally, it returns this concatenated string of code.\n\nPlease note that you need to make sure your markdown document is correctly formatted with correct code blocks and that \"```julia\\n\" appears before the actual julia code and \"\\n```\" appears after. This function will not work properly if these conditions are not met.","status":200,"tokens":[0,312],"elapsed":2.491640253,"_type":"aimessage"}]
