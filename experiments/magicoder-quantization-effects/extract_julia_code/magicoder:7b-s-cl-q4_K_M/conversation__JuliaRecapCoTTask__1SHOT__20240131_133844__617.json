[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    blocks = matchall(\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, 1)\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join the blocks together with a newline\n    code = reduce((a, b)-> string(a, \"\\n\", b), blocks);\n\n    return code;\nend\n\nfunction matchall(pattern::String, s::String, group::Int=0)\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(Regex(pattern), s))\n    if isempty(matches)\n        error(\"No matches found\")\n    end\n    getindex.(matches, group)\nend\n```\nIn this function, `extract_julia_code`, we first use the `matchall` helper function to find all code blocks in the markdown document. The `matchall` function uses a regular expression to find all occurrences of the specified pattern in the string and returns an array of matches. We then remove code fences from each block using `reduce` and `string`, and finally return the combined code blocks as a single string.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is at least one julia code block present in the markdown document, otherwise it will throw an error. If you want to handle cases where there might be no julia code blocks, you should add appropriate error handling.","status":200,"tokens":[0,336],"elapsed":2.748944751,"_type":"aimessage"}]
