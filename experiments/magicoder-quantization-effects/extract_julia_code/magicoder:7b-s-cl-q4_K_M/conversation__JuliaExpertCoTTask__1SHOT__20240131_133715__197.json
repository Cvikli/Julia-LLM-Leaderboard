[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can write this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    code = \"\"\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            if !isempty(code)  # if there was a previous block of code\n                code *= \"\\n\"\n            end\n        elseif endswith(line, \"```\") && length(code) > 0\n            break\n        elseif length(line) >= 4 && line[1:3] == \"```\"\n            continue\n        elseif length(line) > 0\n            code *= line*\"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return code\nend\n```\n\nThis function splits the markdown document into lines, then iterates over each line. If it encounters a line that starts with \"```julia\", it knows that this is the start of a new code block and appends the current contents of `code` to the result (if any). \n\nIf it encounters a line that ends a code block (```` without starting), it stops looking for more blocks.\n\nIt also ignores lines that are just code fences (lines with three backticks at the start and end) by checking if `length(line) >= 4 && line[1:3] == \"```\"`.\n\nFinally, it appends all other lines to `code` as they come. The function then returns the concatenated code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[0,353],"elapsed":2.847522273,"_type":"aimessage"}]
