Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution using regular expressions:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    pattern = r'```julia\\n(.*?)```'\n    matches = re.findall(pattern, md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    if len(matches) == 0:\n        return \"\"\n        \n    code_blocks = [match.strip() for match in matches]\n    joined_code = '\\n'.join(code_blocks)\n    \n    return joined_code\n```\nThis function uses a regular expression to find all occurrences of Julia code blocks in the markdown document, then it strips each block and joins them together with newline characters. If no matches are found, an empty string is returned. \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the Julia code blocks do not contain backticks (`` ` ``), which would break the regular expression. If your Julia code includes backticks, you will need a more complex approach to parse it correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,229],"elapsed":1.796326582,"_type":"aimessage"}]
