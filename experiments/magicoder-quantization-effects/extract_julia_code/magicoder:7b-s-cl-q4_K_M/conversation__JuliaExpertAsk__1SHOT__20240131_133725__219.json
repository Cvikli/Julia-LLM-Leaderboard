Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution using the `markdown` library to parse the markdown:\n\n```python\nimport markdown\nfrom markdown import Markdown\nfrom markdown.inlinepatterns import Pattern\nfrom markdown.util import etree\n\nclass JuliaCodePattern(Pattern):\n    def handleMatch(self, m):\n        el = etree.Element(\"code\")\n        el.text = m.group(2)\n        return el\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    md = Markdown()\n    md.inlinePatterns['code'] = JuliaCodePattern(r'```(.*?)```', md)\n    html = md.convert(md)\n    code_blocks = [x for x in html.split('<code>') if '</code>' in x]\n    return '\\n'.join([x.split('</code>')[0] for x in code_blocks])\n```\n\nThis function uses the `markdown` library to parse the markdown string and extract all the Julia language code blocks, then it joins them together with newline characters.\n\nThe `JuliaCodePattern` class is used to handle matches for the Julia code pattern, which is defined as a regular expression that matches strings between three backticks (```...```). This class returns an HTML element with the matched text enclosed in `<code>` tags when it's handled.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the input `md` string contains valid markdown syntax and Julia code blocks. Also, it doesn't handle cases where there are multiple consecutive backticks (```...```) in a row as they will be treated as a single code block. If you need to handle such cases, you may need to modify the regular expression used in `JuliaCodePattern`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,393],"elapsed":3.150654872,"_type":"aimessage"}]
