Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function in Julia to solve your problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # find all code blocks \n    codeblocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```(.*?)```\", md, greedy=false))\n    \n    # join the code blocks together without the ``` fences\n    julia_code = join([match.captures[1] for match in codeblocks], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return julia_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by using a regular expression to find all matches of backticks (`` ` ``) followed by an arbitrary amount of text (`.*?` for non-greedy matching), and then put them together with newline separators. Please note that the above code is very simple and may not handle edge cases such as correctly identifying a language other than Julia, or properly parsing escaped backticks within the code blocks. For more robust processing of markdown with embedded code, consider using a dedicated library like `Markdown` package in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[0,236],"elapsed":1.900939649,"_type":"aimessage"}]
