[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Split string by three consecutive backticks (`)\n    blocks = split(md, \"```\")\n    \n    # Filter out empty strings and join with newline\n    code_blocks = filter!(x -> !isempty(x), blocks)\n    joined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function splits the input `md` string using the three consecutive backticks as a delimiter. This effectively breaks up the markdown text into an array of strings, where each element is either code block or empty (if there are no code fences). The `filter!` function then removes all empty strings from this array and finally, the `join` function joins these remaining strings with newline characters.\n\nThis implementation assumes that every code block in your markdown document starts and ends with three consecutive backticks (````), which is a common practice when writing markdown code blocks. \n\nPlease note: The above code does not handle nested code fences (i.e., code within another code block). If you have such cases, the task becomes more complex and may need additional processing logic depending on how you want to treat them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,291],"elapsed":2.616051058,"_type":"aimessage"}]
