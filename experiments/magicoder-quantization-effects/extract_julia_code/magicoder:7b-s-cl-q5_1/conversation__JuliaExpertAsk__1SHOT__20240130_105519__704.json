Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution written in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Parse markdown string to HTML tree\n    root = parse_html(md)\n\n    code_blocks = Array{AbstractString,1}()\n\n    # Find all code blocks in the parsed HTML tree\n    for node in root.contents\n        if node isa HtmlText\n            str = node.text\n            if startswith(str, \"```julia\") && endswith(str, \"```\")\n                push!(code_blocks, str[7:end-3])\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Combine all code blocks and remove leading/trailing newlines\n    result = join(code_blocks; sep=\"\\n\", join=true)\n    result = replace(result, r\"^\\n|\\n$\" => \"\")\n\n    return result\nend\n```\nThis function first parses the markdown string to an HTML tree using `parse_html` from the Markdown.jl package, then it traverses this tree to find all code blocks that start and end with \"```julia\" and \"```\", and finally combines them into a single string after removing leading/trailing newlines.\n\nNote: This function assumes that the markdown input is well-formed, which means that each code block is enclosed in ```julia ... ``` blocks. If you expect malformed inputs or mixed languages in one file, you may need to modify this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,350],"elapsed":3.163655017,"_type":"aimessage"}]
