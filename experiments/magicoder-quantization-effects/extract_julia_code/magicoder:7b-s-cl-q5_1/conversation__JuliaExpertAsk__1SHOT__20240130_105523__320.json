Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation in Julia:\n\n```Julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(pattern, md))\n    code_blocks = mapreduce((m) -> m.captures[1], vcat, matches)\n    join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses a regular expression to match any block of text between ```julia\\n and \\n```, which signifies the start and end of a code block in markdown. The \"s\" flag makes it a single line regex, allowing it to span multiple lines. \n\n`collect(eachmatch)` returns an array of `RegexMatch` objects, each containing an array of captures for the match (in this case, just the matched text). \n\nThe `mapreduce` function takes two functions and a collection as arguments. The first function is applied to each element in the collection, reducing the result into one single value. In our case, we map each `RegexMatch` object into its captures (an array of matched strings), then reduce that into an Array of all those strings with `vcat`.\n\nFinally, join the code blocks together with a newline using the `join` function and return the result.\n\nThis function assumes that the input string is properly formatted markdown with correctly-formatted Julia code fences. If there are other kinds of code fences or if the language type isn't \"julia\", this function may not work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[0,354],"elapsed":3.177158624,"_type":"aimessage"}]
