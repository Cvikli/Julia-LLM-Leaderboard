The `findall` function returns an array of matches, each being a Tuple where the first element is the full match and second element is the capturing group (in this case there's only one capturing group). Each of these Tuples are combined into an Array with `join`. The join operation joins all elements in the array with a newline character. The string returned by the function has its leading and trailing newline characters removed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,240],"elapsed":2.173840902,"_type":"aimessage"}]
