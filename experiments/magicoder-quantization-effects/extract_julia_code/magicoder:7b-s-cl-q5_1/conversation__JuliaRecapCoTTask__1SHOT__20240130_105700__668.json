[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Then it filters out those that are not Julia code blocks (i.e., they do not start with three backticks). Finally, it joins the code lines together using newline character, removes code fences using regex, and returns the result as a string.\n\nYou can use it like this:\n```julia\nmd = parse_markdown(\"\"\"\n    ```julia\n    1 + 2\n    ```\n    Some text...\n    ```julia\n    x = 4\n    y = 5\n    z = x + y\n    ```\n    More text...\n\"\"\")\nprintln(extract_julia_code(md)) # outputs \"1 + 2\\nx = 4\\ny = 5\\nz = x + y\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,335],"elapsed":3.110644381,"_type":"aimessage"}]
