[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia function to solve this problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Find all code blocks in markdown\n    blocks = collect.(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1)) |> getfield.(1) |> join.(\"\\n\")\n    \n    # Remove the newline character at start of each block and return as a string\n    return join(blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\nThe function works by first using regular expressions to find all code blocks in the markdown. It then joins these code blocks together into one big string with newlines between each block. The `join` function is used along with a newline string to separate each block. \n\nPlease note that this approach assumes there are no other types of triple backticks used and it simply removes the first line of every block as assumed to be the language declaration. Depending on your exact requirements you may need to adjust this logic.","status":200,"tokens":[0,223],"elapsed":2.047588624,"_type":"aimessage"}]
