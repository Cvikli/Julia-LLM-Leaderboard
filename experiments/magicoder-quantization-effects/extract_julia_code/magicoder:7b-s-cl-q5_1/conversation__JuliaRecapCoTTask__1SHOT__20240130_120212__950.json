[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution written in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regular expressions\n    codeblocks = matchall(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, re\"s\")\n    \n    # Remove code fences from each block and join them into a single string\n    result = reduce((x, y) -> x * \"\\n\" * replace(y, \"`\" => \"\"))(codeblocks)\n\n    return result\nend\n```\nThis function works by first using the `matchall` function with regular expressions to find all code blocks in the input string. The `matchall` function returns an array of matches from a regex, and we pass this array into the `reduce` function along with a function that concatenates strings. \n\nThe `replace` function is used on each code block to remove the code fences (both backticks ` `` ` ). \n\nFinally, it joins all the resulting blocks of Julia code together using the join operator (`*`). \n\nNote: This solution assumes that the input string, `md`, contains only one set of triple-backticks enclosing Julia language code. If there are multiple sets in the input, this function will concatenate them together with newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,293],"elapsed":2.758612011,"_type":"aimessage"}]
