[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of this problem in Julia using regular expressions:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # find all code blocks\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, capture=2))\n    \n    # remove backticks and join into a single string with newline\n    code = join([replace(m, \"`\" => \"\") for m in matches], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function works by using regular expressions to match all the julia language code blocks. It then replaces backticks (` and ``) from each of these matched strings and joins them together with newline characters. The resulting string is then returned as the output. \nPlease note that this solution assumes that all the code blocks are properly formatted, i.e., start with ```julia\\n and end with \\n``` (without space). If there's a possibility of mismatch or improper formatting, you may need to add error handling code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,233],"elapsed":2.093716902,"_type":"aimessage"}]
