[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function that accomplishes this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    code_blocks = [match(r\"```.*?\\n(.*?)\\n```\", block).captures[1] for block in split(md, \"\\n\") if match(r\"```.*?\\n\", block)]\n    return join([replace(block, r\"^```julia\\s*\\n*|\\n*$\" => \"\") for block in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the markdown string into individual lines and searching each line for a Julia code fence. If it finds one, it extracts the content between the fences as a separate string (captured with `match(r\"```.*?\\n(.*?)\\n```\", block).captures[1]`), removing the code fence from the start and end of the string (`replace(block, r\"^```julia\\s*\\n*|\\n*$\" => \"\")`). It then joins all the extracted strings into a single string with newline characters between them.\n\nPlease note that the function will not work properly if there are multiple consecutive code blocks in different languages or if they have additional code fences (like `:::julia`) within them, as it assumes that Julia is always being used. For more complex markdown syntaxes or mixed language code fences, you would need a more sophisticated function to handle these cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,333],"elapsed":3.031129276,"_type":"aimessage"}]
