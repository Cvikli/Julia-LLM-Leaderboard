Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code block start and end positions\n    regex = r\"```\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(regex, md))\n    \n    # Extract the code blocks from the markdown string\n    code_blocks = String[]\n    for match in matches\n        push!(code_blocks, match.captures[1])\n    end\n    \n    # Concatenate all code blocks with a newline separator\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function works by using regular expression to find all the ```\\n...\\n``` code block matches in your `md` string. It then extracts each one and pushes it into an array `code_blocks`. The final step is joining all the code blocks together with newline character `\\n`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,217],"elapsed":1.949046862,"_type":"aimessage"}]
