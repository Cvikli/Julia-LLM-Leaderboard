[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how this function could be implemented in Julia:\n\n```Julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    blocks = split(md, \"```\")\n    cleaned_blocks = String[]\n    for block in blocks[2:end] # skipping the first element because it's empty after splitting\n        push!(cleaned_blocks, replace(block, \"`\" => \"\"))\n    end\n    return join(cleaned_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function takes a markdown string as input and splits it into an array of blocks based on the ````...``` format. It then removes code fences (the backticks) from each block and joins them together with newline characters. The extracted code blocks are returned as a String.\n\nNote: This is assuming that every Julia code block starts and ends with \"```\" in markdown, which is the standard way to indicate a code block in markdown. If your markdown may have code blocks formatted differently or use other syntax for start and end of code block, you would need more complex parsing rules.","status":200,"tokens":[0,248],"elapsed":2.268413753,"_type":"aimessage"}]
