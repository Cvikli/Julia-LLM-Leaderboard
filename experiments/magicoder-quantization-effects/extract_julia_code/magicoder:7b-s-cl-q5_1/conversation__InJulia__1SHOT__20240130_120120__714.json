The captured code is then cleaned by removing the newline characters between each line of code (`\\n`) and joining them with a single newline character (\"\\n\").\n\nNote: This function assumes that the input `md` is well-formed, meaning it has matching pairs of \"```\" (backticks) at both ends of every Julia code block. If this assumption does not hold, you may need to modify the regex pattern or add additional error checking to handle malformed inputs.\nAlso note that the output will contain all the newlines in the original extracted code. \nIf you want to avoid retaining these newlines, replace `m.captures[1]` with `replace(m.captures[1], \"\\n\", \"\")` in the join function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,339],"elapsed":3.051252284,"_type":"aimessage"}]
