It returns an array of strings corresponding to each code block found in the markdown document with language \"julia\".\n\nThe blocks are extracted using a parser function (closure) which checks if the current event is a code block (`ctx.event === MD.Code`) and if its language is Julia (\"ctx.info.lang == \\\"julia\\\"\"). If both conditions are met, it strips leading and trailing whitespace from the data and returns it as a string. The results of these parsing operations are collected into an array which is passed to `join` function for joining them together with newline characters.\n\nFinally, the code is further cleaned up by removing any remaining code fences (triple backticks) using the replace method. \n\nPlease remember to install Parsers.MD package in your environment before running this function as it might not be pre-installed. You can do so using `]add Parsers.MD` command in Julia's REPL.","status":200,"tokens":[0,475],"elapsed":4.300349763,"_type":"aimessage"}]
