Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use the `Markdown.parse` and `HTML` functions in the Documenter package for this task. Here's an example:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    blocks = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    code_blocks = []\n    \n    # loop through all lines in markdown\n    for block in blocks \n        if startswith(block, \"```julia\")\n            start_index = findnext('\\n', block)\n            if start_index != nothing\n                end_index = findnext(\"```\", block, start_index)\n                if end_index != nothing\n                    push!(code_blocks, block[start_index+1:end_index-2])\n                end\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # join all code blocks together with a newline\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function loops over the lines in your markdown document. If it finds a line that starts with ```julia (which is a common way to start a code block), it then looks for the next occurrence of \"```\" after a newline and before the end of the block. \n\nIf both conditions are satisfied, it extracts the relevant code between these markers, removes the fencing markers from each side, and appends this cleaned up code block to the list `code_blocks`. Once all the code blocks have been processed in this way, it joins them together into a single string separated by newline characters.\n\nRemember to make sure your markdown document is correctly formatted with ```julia for starting each block and \"```\" at both ends of each block.","status":200,"tokens":[0,382],"elapsed":3.418987032,"_type":"aimessage"}]
