Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use regular expressions to solve this problem in Julia. The function `extract_julia_code` below uses regex to find all lines that start and end with three backticks. It then removes these code fences from each found block of code and joins them together into one string separated by a newline character, `\\n`.\n\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all blocks of code using regex\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seperators=[\"\\n\"]))\n    if isempty(matches)\n        return \"\"  # Return empty string if no code blocks found\n    end\n\n    # Remove code fences from each block of code and join them together\n    joined_code = reduce((x, y) -> x * \"\\n\" * match(r\"```\\n(.*?)\\n```\", y).captures[1], matches)\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nIn this function:\n- `eachmatch` is used to find all blocks of code in the input string. \n- Each block is a sub-string that starts with three backticks (````\\n) and ends with three backticks (\\n```). \n- The regex `r\"```\\n(.*?)\\n```\" is used to match these code blocks. The `.*?` inside the parentheses is a lazy quantifier (`?`) meaning it will match as few characters as possible, rather than as many as possible. This prevents it from matching across multiple lines of code.\n- `match(r\"```\\n(.*?)\\n```\", y).captures[1]` is used to extract the actual code block from each match object `y`. The `.captures` field returns a tuple containing all captures (i.e., substrings) made by the regex, and since we only have one capture group (`(.*?)`) in our regex, it will return the code block itself.\n- `reduce((x, y) -> x * \"\\n\" * match(r\"```\\n(.*?)\\n```\", y).captures[1], matches)` is used to join all blocks of code together with a newline character between each one. The `*` operator is the string concatenation operator in Julia.\n- If no code blocks are found, an empty string is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,531],"elapsed":4.805222425,"_type":"aimessage"}]
