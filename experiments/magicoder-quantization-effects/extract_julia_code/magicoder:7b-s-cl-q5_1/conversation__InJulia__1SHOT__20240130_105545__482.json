If it encounters a line that starts with ```julia (which is how markdown code blocks are started), it starts recording the lines as part of a code block. When it reaches another line starting with ```julia, it stops recording and adds the recorded lines to a list. After all lines have been processed, if there's still a code block being recorded, an error is thrown because the document was not properly closed. Finally, join all the code blocks together into one string.","status":200,"tokens":[88,364],"elapsed":3.297362484,"_type":"aimessage"}]
