If it encounters a '`' when not currently inside a code block, it starts capturing the next block. When another '`' is encountered after starting a code block, it adds the captured code to the list of blocks and resets its internal state for the next code block. In between these code blocks, any other characters are simply added to the current block. Finally, it joins all the collected blocks with newlines in between and returns the result as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,325],"elapsed":2.947765391,"_type":"aimessage"}]
