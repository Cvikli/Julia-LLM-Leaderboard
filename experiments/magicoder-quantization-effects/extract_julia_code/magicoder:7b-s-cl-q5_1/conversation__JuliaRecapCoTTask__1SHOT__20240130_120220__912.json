[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how this function might look in Julia:\n\n```julia\nimport Base.convert\nfunction convert(::Type{String}, md::Markdown.MD)\n    s = \"\"\n    for x in md.content\n        if isa(x, Markdown.CodeBlock) && (x.lang == \"julia\" || x.lang == nothing)\n            push!(s, replace(replace(string(x), r\"```\", \"`\"), \"\\n\" => \";\"))\n        end\n    end\n    s = join([strip(x) for x in s], \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nIn this code, the function `convert` is used to convert a markdown document into a string. The `for` loop goes through each element in the content of the Markdown document (which could be paragraphs, headers, blocks of code, etc.). If an element is a code block and its language is either \"julia\" or undefined (which means it's plain text), then it appends the stripped version of the string representation of that code block to `s`. Finally, it joins all the code blocks together with newline characters.\nThe `replace` functions are used to remove backticks (`\\``), which mark code blocks in Markdown, and newlines (`\\n`), which can mess up Julia's interpretation of multiline strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,302],"elapsed":2.79430588,"_type":"aimessage"}]
