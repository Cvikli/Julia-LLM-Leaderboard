[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String.

If a line starts with \"```julia\", it knows that we're in a code block, and removes the fences from subsequent lines until it sees a line ending with \"```\". The resulting code is added to an output string. \n\nIf there are multiple consecutive code blocks, they will be joined together by newline characters in the final `output` string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,282],"elapsed":2.533660109,"_type":"aimessage"}]
