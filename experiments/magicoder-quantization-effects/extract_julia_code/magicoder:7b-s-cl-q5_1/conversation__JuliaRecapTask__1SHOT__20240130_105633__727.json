[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the function `extract_julia_code`. This function assumes that markdown file is passed as a string. You may want to modify it for different use cases. It uses regular expressions and the Markdown.parse function from Markdown.jl package to parse the markdown and extract code blocks.\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    parsed = Markdown.parse(md)\n    \n    raw_blocks = Vector{AbstractString}()\n    for block in parsed\n        if isa(block, Markdown.CodeBlock) && occursin(\"julia\", lowercase(getfield(block, :info)))\n            push!(raw_blocks, join(block.code, '\\n')) \n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(raw_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function starts by parsing the markdown with `Markdown.parse()`. It then iterates through each element in the parsed structure and checks if it's a code block (`isa(block, Markdown.CodeBlock)`) and if the language specifier contains \"julia\" (occursin(\"julia\", lowercase(getfield(block, :info)))). If both conditions are true, it joins the lines of the code block together with newline characters (\"\\n\") and pushes that into a vector. The function returns the joined string from this vector after joining all the elements in the vector with two newlines between each element.\n\nNote: This function does not handle cases where there is no language specified for the code block. You may want to add error handling or default behavior in such cases depending on your specific use case.","status":200,"tokens":[0,378],"elapsed":3.491394804,"_type":"aimessage"}]
