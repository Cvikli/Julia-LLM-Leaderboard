The part `.*?` is a lazy match which will match as few characters as possible (non-greedy) before matching `\\n```. This is necessary to correctly handle multiple consecutive code blocks in different languages since the engine would stop at the first closing triple backticks (````), even if there are more code blocks following.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that markdown syntax for code fences (i.e., lines of text surrounded by three backticks) is used, and that all code blocks in the provided string `md` are indeed Julia blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[0,261],"elapsed":2.339391483,"_type":"aimessage"}]
