Then we extract all the block quotes and join their content. Here `escape_latex` ensures that special LaTeX characters don't break our parsing, but it might not be necessary in your use case.\n\nHowever, remember this function will only work for simple cases where there is no nested markdown elements (like nested lists or code blocks) and the source markdown file is a valid GitHub flavor Markdown.","status":200,"tokens":[0,279],"elapsed":2.511792853,"_type":"aimessage"}]
