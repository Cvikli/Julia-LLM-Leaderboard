[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function which fulfills your requirements:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    code_blocks = []\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"````\")\n            push!(code_blocks, \"\")\n        elseif length(line) > 0 && startswith(line, \"`\")\n            push!(code_blocks[end], line[2:end-1])\n        end\n    end\n\n    code = join([join(code_blocks[i][2:end-1] * \"\\n\" for i in eachindex(code_blocks) if length(code_blocks[i]) > 0], \"\\n\") for _ in 1:length(code_blocks) if length(code_blocks[findlast(x-> length(x)>=0, code_blocks)])>0]\n\n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the markdown document into lines and going through each line. When it encounters a line that begins with ` ``` ` (four backticks), it starts collecting subsequent lines as part of a new code block. If it encounters a line that does not start with ` ``` ` but does start with ` ` `, it appends the rest of the line to the current code block. When it encounters a line that starts with ` ``` ` (four backticks), again, it stops collecting lines for the current code block and moves on to the next one. After finishing collecting all the code blocks, it joins them together into a single string separated by newline characters. \n\nRemember, this function assumes your markdown document is correctly formatted according to the rules of Markdown. If not, you may need to preprocess the input document to handle more complex cases, such as nested code fences or multi-line code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[88,434],"elapsed":3.931223107,"_type":"aimessage"}]
