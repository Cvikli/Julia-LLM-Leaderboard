[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise.

Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can accomplish this using regular expressions in Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    matches = re.findall(r'```julia(.+?)```', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # Remove code fences from each match and join them into a single string\n    return \"\\n\".join([match.strip() for match in matches])\n```\nThis function uses the `re.findall` method to find all occurrences of blocks of text enclosed by three backticks (```), then processes these matched groups with `strip()` to remove any leading/trailing whitespace and newlines, and finally joins them into a single string using `\"\\n\".join()`.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes the input markdown document is in standard markdown format and correctly formatted Julia code blocks. If the markdown or code isn't properly formatted, it might not work as expected. Also remember to replace `re` with `import re` at the start of your python script if you haven't done so already.","status":200,"tokens":[0,256],"elapsed":2.294589053,"_type":"aimessage"}]
