[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function `extract_julia_code` that fulfills your requirements:\n```julia\nimport Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Parse the markdown document and find code blocks.\n    blocks = Markdown.parse(md) |> Markdown.findall(Markdown.CodeBlock)\n    \n    # Extract all code from the code blocks, remove code fences.\n    code_blocks = [replace(split(b.code, \"\\n\")[2:end-1]...)] for b in blocks if endswith(b.code, \"\\n```\")]\n\n    # Join code blocks with newline and return as string.\n    join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `Markdown` package to parse the markdown document and extract all the code blocks. It then joins these code blocks together with a newline character and returns the resulting string. \n\nPlease note that the task mentions a Markdown document `md`, but doesn't provide an example of what this could look like, so it's impossible to give an exact solution for your problem. However, I hope the explanation above can help you understand how to extract code blocks from such documents in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[0,283],"elapsed":2.616397135,"_type":"aimessage"}]
