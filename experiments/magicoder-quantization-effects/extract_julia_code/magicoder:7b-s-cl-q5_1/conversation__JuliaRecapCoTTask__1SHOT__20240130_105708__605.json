[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"This problem requires knowledge of Markdown syntax for extracting code blocks from Julia documents, as well as familiarity with regular expressions (regex). We will use the `md` package in Julia to parse markdown and get blocks of text. Then we will process these blocks to remove fences around code and join them into a single string.\n\nHere's how you could do it:\n\n```julia\nusing MD\nusing Base64: base64decode\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String, instructions)\n    blocks = parse_md(md)\n    \n    code_blocks = []\n    for block in blocks\n        if typeof(block) == CodeBlock && occursin(\"julia\", string(block.lang))\n            append!(code_blocks, split(string(block), \"\\n\"))\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Remove fences\n    code_blocks = map(strip, code_blocks)\n    \n    # Join into single string with newline separator\n    code_str = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    \n    return code_str\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `parse_md` function from the `MD` package to parse markdown text and extract blocks of code. If a block is identified as being written in Julia (based on the language indicator), it is split into lines, stripped of leading/trailing white space, and added to an array called `code_blocks`. This array is then processed further to remove fences around each code snippet, and finally all these snippets are joined together with a newline separator. \n\nNote that the `occursin` function is used to check if the language indicator for Julia exists in the `lang` field of the CodeBlock object; if it does, then the block is considered to be written in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[0,408],"elapsed":3.802429046,"_type":"aimessage"}]
