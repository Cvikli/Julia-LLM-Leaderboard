Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    blocks = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    code_blocks = String[]\n\n    for block in blocks\n        if startswith(block, \"```julia\") && endswith(block, \"```\")\n            push!(code_blocks, block[7:-3])  # remove the language declaration and fences\n        end\n    end\n    \n    join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function assumes that there are only Julia code blocks in the Markdown document. If there may be other code blocks or non-Julia code blocks, additional checks would need to be added.\n\nNote: This implementation uses the `Markdown` package which parses the markdown string into a tree of blocks, but it doesn't really handle nested fenced code blocks in the traditional Markdown sense (i.e., with three backticks). If you have such use case, a more sophisticated solution would be required.","status":200,"tokens":[0,247],"elapsed":2.216610219,"_type":"aimessage"}]
