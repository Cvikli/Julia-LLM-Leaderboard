[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you could implement `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    code_blocks = []\n    in_code_block = false\n    \n    for line in lines \n        if occursin(\"```\", line)\n            if in_code_block\n                push!(code_blocks, join(curr_lines, \"\\n\"))\n                curr_lines = []\n                in_code_block = false\n            else\n                in_code_block = true\n            end\n        elseif in_code_block && !occursin(\"```\", line) \n            push!(curr_lines, line[3:end]) # remove code fences and add to current block\n        end\n    end\n    \n    if in_code_block \n        push!(code_blocks, join(curr_lines, \"\\n\"))  # add remaining lines to last block if not closed properly\n        \n    end\n    \n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the markdown text into individual lines and iterating through each line. If a line with ``` is found, then it toggles whether it's currently in a code block or not. If a line doesn't start with ``` but is in a code block, it removes the first three characters (the backtick characters) and adds the remaining string to the current block of code. If there are multiple code blocks in the markdown, then it joins them together with newline character at the end.\n\nRemember that this function assumes the markdown document is correctly formatted where each code block starts and ends with ``` ``` and that no code block extends beyond one or more lines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,402],"elapsed":3.729724163,"_type":"aimessage"}]
