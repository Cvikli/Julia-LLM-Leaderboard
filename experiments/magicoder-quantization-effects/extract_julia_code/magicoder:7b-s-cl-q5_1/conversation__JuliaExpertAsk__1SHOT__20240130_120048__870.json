Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can implement it using Regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks between ``` and ```\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, capture=2))\n    \n    # Combine the matched blocks with newline separators\n    combined_blocks = join(matches, \"\\n\")\n    \n    return combined_blocks\nend\n```\n\nIn this function:\n\n- The regular expression `\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n``` matches a block of code surrounded by three backticks. The `\\n` inside the parentheses is for matching any text within those blocks, `.*?` makes it non-greedy to match only as little content as possible.\n\n- Then we collect all these matched strings with `collect(eachmatch(...))`.\n\n- Finally we join all the collected strings using newline character (`\"\\n\"`) and return this joined string.\n\nRemember, if there are multiple code blocks without newlines between them, they will be concatenated together. If you want to leave a newline between each block, replace `join(matches, \"\\n\")` with `reduce((a,b)->string(a,\"\\n\",b), matches)`.\n\nThis function assumes that the language identifier (`julia`) is present at the end of the fence line and there's no leading or trailing whitespace. If you want it to be more robust, you would need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,345],"elapsed":3.104558865,"_type":"aimessage"}]
