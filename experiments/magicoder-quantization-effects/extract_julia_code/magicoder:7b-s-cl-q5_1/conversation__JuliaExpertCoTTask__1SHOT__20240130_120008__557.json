Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that accomplishes this task:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all matches of the code block pattern\n    m = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, captures=true))\n    \n    # Initialize empty string for collected code\n    code = \"\"\n    \n    for match in m\n        # Add the code inside the code block to the collected code\n        append!(code, match[1])\n    end\n    \n    return join(code, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, `eachmatch` is used to find all occurrences of the pattern in the markdown document. It returns a collection of matches where each match is an array that contains the whole matched string and its captures (if any). We only want to extract the code inside the Julia block so we take `match[1]`. The extracted codes are appended to our `code` variable.\n\nThe function then joins all the collected codes into one long String with newline characters between each code block.","status":200,"tokens":[0,243],"elapsed":2.191645671,"_type":"aimessage"}]
