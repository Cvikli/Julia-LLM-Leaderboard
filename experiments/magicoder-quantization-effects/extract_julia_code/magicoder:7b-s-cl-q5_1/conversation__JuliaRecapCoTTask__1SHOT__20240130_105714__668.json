[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of a function `extract_julia_code` in Julia that follows the instructions given:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    pattern = r\"^```julia.*?\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(pattern, md, CM())) do m\n        replace(m.captures[1], \"\\n\" => \"\") # remove newlines\n    end\n    \n    join(matches, \"\\n\") \nend\n```\nIn the function above:\n- `^```julia.*?\\n(.*?)\\n```: This is a regular expression (regex) pattern that matches all julia code blocks. It captures everything between ```julia and ``` including newlines.\n- `collect(eachmatch...) do m ... end`: Applies the function to each match in the regex.\n- `replace(m.captures[1], \"\\n\" => \"\")`: Removes newline characters from the matched code.\n- `join(matches, \"\\n\")`: Joins all the extracted matches (code blocks) into a single string with newlines between each block.\n\nThis function will work if there are multiple code blocks in the markdown document and if they have different indents. However, it assumes that no code block has any nested ```julia ``` blocks, which would interfere with the regular expression. If this is not a safe assumption for your use case, you might need a more complex function to handle nested code blocks or indented code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[0,345],"elapsed":3.208206594,"_type":"aimessage"}]
