It then joins all these blocks together and removes any code fence markers that may have been included in the original markdown. Note that the regular expression `\"^```julia\"` matches lines starting with the code block delimiters, effectively removing them.\n\nIn the `collect(Markdown.parse(md, flavor=:fenced_divs))`, we're telling Markdown to parse the string as fenced_div blocks which are code blocks enclosed in three backticks (` ``` `) and a language name (in this case, \"julia\"). \n\nThen `map(s -> s[2]...` is used on these parsed blocks to access the second element of each tuple. Tuples from Markdown.parse are: `(fence::String, block::AbstractString)`. The first element is a fence string like `\"```julia\"`, and the second one is actual code string. \n\nLastly, `join(..., \"\")` joins all the strings together with an empty separator (i.e., it just concatenates them). \n\nRemember to import the necessary modules before using this function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,381],"elapsed":3.435387223,"_type":"aimessage"}]
