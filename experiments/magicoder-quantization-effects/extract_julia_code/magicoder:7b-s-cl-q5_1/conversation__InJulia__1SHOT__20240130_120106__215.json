Then it iterates over each line. If a line starts with \"```julia\" (or \"````\") then we add its content to `extracted_code` after removing code fences (`\"`). If a line ends a code block, we break out of the loop. At the end, it returns `extracted_code`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,345],"elapsed":3.101693738,"_type":"aimessage"}]
