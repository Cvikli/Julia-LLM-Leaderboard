Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could do this in Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    pattern = r'```(.*?)```'\n    matches = re.findall(pattern, md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    if len(matches) > 0:\n        return \"\\n\".join([match.strip() for match in matches])\n    else:\n        return \"\"\n```\nThis function uses the `re` module to find all matching code blocks using a regular expression that looks for lines enclosed by three backticks (```), and then removes any leading/trailing whitespace from each match before joining them together with newline characters. If no matches are found, an empty string is returned.\n  \nPlease note: \n- This function assumes that the input `md` will be a markdown document as a string.\n- The function uses `re.DOTALL` to make `.` match any character including newlines, which allows it to capture code blocks spanning multiple lines.\n- We use `.strip()` to remove leading/trailing whitespace from the matched code block strings before joining them together with newline characters. This ensures that there is no extraneous white space at the start or end of each line of the final concatenated string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,288],"elapsed":2.584310624,"_type":"aimessage"}]
