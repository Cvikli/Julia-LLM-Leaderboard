Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can extract and join the code blocks from the markdown document:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all julia code blocks in the markdown document\n    blocks = []\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    i = 1\n    while i <= length(lines)\n        if lines[i] == \"```julia\"\n            block = \"\"\n            j = i + 1\n            # Find the end of the code block\n            while !startswith(lines[j], \"```\")\n                block *= lines[j] * \"\\n\"\n                j += 1\n            end\n            push!(blocks, block)\n            i = j + 1\n        else\n            i += 1\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline character\n    return join(blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function iterates over each line of the markdown document. When it encounters the start of a julia code block (i.e., \"```julia\"), it starts collecting lines into the current block until it sees the end marker (\"```\"). It then pushes this block onto an array, and moves on to look for the next block. If it doesn't see the start of a new block, it simply moves on to the next line. Once all blocks have been collected, it joins them together with a newline character between each one, and returns that string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,343],"elapsed":2.799191827,"_type":"aimessage"}]
