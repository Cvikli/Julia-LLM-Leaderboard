[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a way to solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code = \"\"\n    in_block = false\n    for line in split(md, '\\n')\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_block = true\n            continue\n        elseif in_block && endswith(line, \"```\")\n            in_block = false\n            continue\n        elseif in_block\n            code *= line[6:end] * \"\\n\"  # remove the initial '    ' spaces\n        end\n    end\n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function operates by iterating over each line of the markdown document. If it encounters a line that starts with \"```julia\", it sets `in_block` to true and continues to the next line (ignoring the contents). If it encounters a line that ends with \"```\", it sets `in_block` to false and continues. For lines within blocks, it appends them to the code string, removing the leading four spaces that markdown uses for indentation.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that there are no nested fenced code blocks in your markdown document (as is usual). If you have such cases, the problem becomes significantly more complex and would likely involve a stack-based approach to keep track of nested blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[0,312],"elapsed":2.597471189,"_type":"aimessage"}]
