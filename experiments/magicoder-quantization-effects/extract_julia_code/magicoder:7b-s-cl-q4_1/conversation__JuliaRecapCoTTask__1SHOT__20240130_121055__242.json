[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might write this function in Julia. \n\nThis function uses regular expressions (`Regex`) to match the parts of the markdown document that contains code blocks. It assumes that the code block fences are delimited by three backticks (i.e., ```).\n\n```julia\nusing Regex, Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Matches lines containing a julia code block, including surrounding triple backticks\n    pattern = r\"```\\n(.*?)```\"ms\n\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(pattern, md))\n    code_blocks = [M.captures[1] for M in matches]\n    joined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first defining a regular expression that matches a block of Julia code between two sets of backticks (```...```). The `m` flag at the end of the regex makes it match across multiple lines. \n\nThen, we apply this regex to our Markdown string and collect all matches into an array named `matches`. We then extract each captured group (i.e., the actual code) from these matches and store them in another array named `code_blocks`. Finally, we join all of these blocks together with a newline character (`\\n`), resulting in a single string containing all our code joined together.\n\nIf you need to deal with fences that have different numbers of backticks (i.e., three on either side), the regex pattern would have to be more complex, but this should work for the basic cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,368],"elapsed":3.025784811,"_type":"aimessage"}]
