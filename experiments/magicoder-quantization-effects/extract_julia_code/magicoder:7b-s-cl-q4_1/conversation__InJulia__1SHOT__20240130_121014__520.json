Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String.

Then it goes through each line and checks if it's the start of a code block (`\" ```julia\"` or `\" ```\"). When it sees a start, it starts to append codes in the current code block until it sees an end marker (another \"` ```\"). It then sets `in_code_block` flag to false. When appending lines into the code blocks, we remove the \"```\" part at both ends of each line. Finally, it joins all the code blocks together with a newline and return the result.\n\nRemember that this function assumes there is no other language specified than Julia in your markdown file. If you have different languages, this will need to be adapted to handle them correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,356],"elapsed":2.842937939,"_type":"aimessage"}]
