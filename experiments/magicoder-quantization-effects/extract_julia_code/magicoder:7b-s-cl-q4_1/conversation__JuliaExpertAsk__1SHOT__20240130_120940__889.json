Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the function that will do what you asked for:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    blocks = Markdown.parse(md).content\n    codeblocks = filter(x -> x isa Markdown.Code, blocks)\n    return join([string(block.lang, \"\\n\", block.code) for block in codeblocks], \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by parsing the markdown string into a list of content elements using `Markdown.parse()`. It then filters out non-code blocks and extracts the code blocks, joining them together with newline characters.\n\nPlease note that you need to have the \"Markdown\" package installed in your Julia environment to use this function. You can add it via:\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"Markdown\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,199],"elapsed":1.587705423,"_type":"aimessage"}]
