[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can write this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    blocks = split(md, \"\\n```julia\\n\") # Split the markdown into code blocks\n    joined_blocks = join([block * \"\\n\" for block in blocks[2:end]], \"\\n\") \n    return joined_blocks\nend\n```\nThis function works by first splitting the input string `md` using `split` based on occurrences of `\"\\n```julia\\n\"` to identify code blocks. The first element of the resulting array will always be an empty string as a result of how split works, so we skip it in our final output. Then each code block is joined into one big string with join.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes you have exactly one Julia code block per markdown cell. If you have more than one, the function will concatenate them together with a newline in between. If you want to keep each code block separate, you'll need to handle that differently.","status":200,"tokens":[0,242],"elapsed":1.926925766,"_type":"aimessage"}]
