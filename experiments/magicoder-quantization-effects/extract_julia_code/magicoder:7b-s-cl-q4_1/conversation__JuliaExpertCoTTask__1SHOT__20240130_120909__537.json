Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can solve the problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Regex to match the code block\n    code_block_pattern = r\"```julia(.+?)```\"s\n    \n    matches = collect(eachmatch(code_block_pattern, md)) \n\n    if length(matches) > 0\n        join([replace(m.captures[1], \"\\n\", \"\") for m in matches], \"\\n\")\n    else\n        \"\"\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `eachmatch` function to find all matches of the code block pattern in the markdown text. Each match is a `Match` object which contains an array of captures, where the first capture is the content inside the code fences. The content is then replaced with newline characters removed using `replace(m.captures[1], \"\\n\", \"\")`.\nIf no matches were found, it will return an empty string. \n\nThe join operation concatenates all these strings into one single string, separated by a newline character (`\\n`). If there was more than one code block, this function returns them joined together in the required manner.","status":200,"tokens":[0,265],"elapsed":2.14083305,"_type":"aimessage"}]
