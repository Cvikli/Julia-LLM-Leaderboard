[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The function `extract_julia_code` can be defined as follows:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString, instructions)\n    # Find the code blocks in the markdown text\n    codeblocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, \n                            flags=re.MULTILINE_OPTIONS | re.DOTALL))\n    \n    # If there are multiple code blocks, combine them with a newline\n    if length(codeblocks) > 1\n        code = reduce((x, y) -> x * \"\\n\" * y, map(first, codeblocks))\n    else\n        code = first(codeblocks)[1]\n    end\n    \n    # Remove the code fences from the combined code blocks\n    code = replace(code, \"`\" => \"\")\n    \n    return code\nend\n```\n\nThis function first matches and collects all the Julia code blocks in the markdown text. The `eachmatch` function is used for non-overlapping matches of a regular expression pattern. Then the collected code blocks are joined into one string, separated by newlines. After that, the code fences (backticks) are removed from the combined code blocks using the replace function.\n\nThe special instructions are not explicitly mentioned in your problem statement. For handling such specific use cases, you need to update this function according to the instructions provided.","status":200,"tokens":[11,327],"elapsed":2.695604958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
