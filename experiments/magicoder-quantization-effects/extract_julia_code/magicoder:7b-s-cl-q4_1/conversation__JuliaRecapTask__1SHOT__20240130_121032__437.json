[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem using the markdown parsing library in Julia called \"Markdown.jl\". Below is a simple implementation of `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    blocks = []\n    # Parse the markdown and iterate over elements\n    parsed = parse_md(md);\n    for block in parsed.content\n        if isa(block, CodeBlock) && occursin(\"julia\", block.language)\n            push!(blocks, join(map(x -> x.code, block.contents), \"\\n\"))  # extract and join code blocks\n        end\n    end\n    return join(blocks, \"\\n\")  # join all blocks into a single string with newline separator\nend\n```\nThis function goes through every element in the markdown parsed into `parsed` structure. If it's a code block (`CodeBlock`) and the language is Julia (`\"julia\"`), then it appends the joined code content of that block to `blocks`. Finally, it joins all blocks together with newline separators and returns the result.\n\nPlease note, this solution assumes that there are no other languages within your code blocks (like Python or R). If you have such cases, you might need a more complex approach.","status":200,"tokens":[0,296],"elapsed":2.474829771,"_type":"aimessage"}]
