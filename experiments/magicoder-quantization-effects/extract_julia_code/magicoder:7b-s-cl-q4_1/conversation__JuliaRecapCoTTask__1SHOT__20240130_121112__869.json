[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

It then extracts all code blocks, removes fences from them (by adding and removing the backtick), and joins them together with a newline character if there are multiple code blocks present. The `\\n *` in `\"\\n\" * code` is to ensure that every line except for the first starts with a newline. The `String[]` is used as an array of strings for storing all_code. `setdiff(start_indices, stop_indices)` checks if there are any indices without corresponding stops which would indicate mismatched code block fences.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that there aren't other backticks inside the code blocks and that markdown uses only one kind of backtick to open and close code blocks. If your Markdown uses different kinds or if there are other kinds of characters like quotes inside the code blocks, you might need a more sophisticated approach.","status":200,"tokens":[0,492],"elapsed":4.07965388,"_type":"aimessage"}]
