If there are multiple code blocks, it joins them together with a newline character in between. The function is tested by printing out the result for two different code blocks.\n\nNote: This assumes that all code blocks start with ````julia` and end with ````. Adjustments may be needed if this assumption does not hold true.","status":200,"tokens":[0,286],"elapsed":2.281541162,"_type":"aimessage"}]
