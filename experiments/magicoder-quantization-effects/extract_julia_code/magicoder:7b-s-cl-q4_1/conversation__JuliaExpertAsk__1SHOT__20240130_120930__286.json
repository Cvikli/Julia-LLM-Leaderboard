Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how to write this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks\n    codes = []\n    for line in split(md, '\\n')\n        if startswith(line, \"```\")\n            push!(codes, \"\")\n        elseif !isempty(codes) && endswith(line, \"```\")\n            last_code = pop!(codes)\n            append!(last_code, \"\\n\" * line)\n        elseif !isempty(codes)\n            codes[end] *= '\\n' * line\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Concatenate the code blocks\n    all_code = join(codes, '\\n')\n\n    # Remove code fences\n    for i in 1:2:length(all_code)\n        if all_code[i] == '`' && all_code[i+2] == '`'\n            all_code = replace(all_code, all_code[i] => '')\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return String(all_code)\nend\n```\n\nThis function `extract_julia_code` first identifies code blocks by looking for lines that start and end with three backticks (```). Inside those blocks, it joins them together with a newline character. If there are multiple code blocks, they will be joined together in the order they appear. After all the code blocks have been processed, code fences (backticks) are removed. Finally, the resulting string is returned.\n\nRemember to import `Base`:\n```julia\nusing Base: startswith, endswith, push!, append!\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,384],"elapsed":3.093241347,"_type":"aimessage"}]
