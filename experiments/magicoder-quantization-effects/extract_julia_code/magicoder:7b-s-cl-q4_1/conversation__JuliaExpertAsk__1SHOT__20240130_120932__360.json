Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is a solution in Julia. \n\nThe `extract_julia_code` function uses regular expressions (`Regex`) to find code blocks surrounded by three backticks. It then removes those three backticks using the `replace` function with an empty string. Finally, it joins the found code blocks together with a newline character.\n\n```julia\nusing REPL.Terminals: widen\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String) \n    regex = r\"```julia(.+?)```\"s\n    matches = [match]\n    for match in eachmatch(regex, md, collect=false)\n        push!(matches, Substring(match.captures[1]))\n    end\n    join([replace(m, \"`\\\"`\\\"\"=>\"\") for m in matches], \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function works with markdown-formatted strings. It's assumed that the input `md` is a string containing markdown code. \n\nIf the markdown document might contain other triple backticks (fences), this solution will not work correctly, as it considers anything inside the fence to be Julia code. If you need to handle nested or mismatched fences, more complex regular expressions would be needed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,280],"elapsed":2.267559418,"_type":"aimessage"}]
