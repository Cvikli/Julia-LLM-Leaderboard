Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Python solution for your problem using the markdown module in Python:\n\n```python\nimport markdown as md\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # Extract all code blocks from markdown document\n    codeblocks = [match[0] for match in md.findall(r'```(.*?)```', md, re.DOTALL)][1:] \n    \n    # If there are multiple code blocks, join them together with newline\n    if len(codeblocks)>1:\n        return \"\\n\".join(codeblocks)\n    else:\n        return codeblocks[0]\n```\n\nHere is how the function `extract_julia_code` works:\n\n- It searches for all substrings between ``` and ``` in the markdown document (using re.DOTALL). These are the code blocks in the md string. \n- The [1:] is used to remove the first empty match found by the regular expression.\n- If there are multiple matches, join them together with a newline (\\n) using the `join` function. Otherwise, just return the single code block. \n\nPlease note that the Python `re` module is used for regular expressions in this solution.","status":200,"tokens":[0,276],"elapsed":2.083992584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
