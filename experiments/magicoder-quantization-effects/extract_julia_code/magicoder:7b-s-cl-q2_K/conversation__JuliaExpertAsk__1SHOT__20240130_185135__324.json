Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you might define such a function in Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # Find all code blocks using regular expression\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```(.*?)\\n(.*?)```', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # Concatenate code blocks without any leading or trailing whitespace\n    joined_code = '\\n'.join([code for _, code in code_blocks]).strip()\n    \n    return joined_code\n```\nThis function will extract all the code blocks from markdown, concatenate them together with newline characters and strip off any leading/trailing white spaces. The returned string is pure Julia language code. Note that we use `re.DOTALL` to let `.` match any character including new lines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,187],"elapsed":1.44314017,"_type":"aimessage"}]
