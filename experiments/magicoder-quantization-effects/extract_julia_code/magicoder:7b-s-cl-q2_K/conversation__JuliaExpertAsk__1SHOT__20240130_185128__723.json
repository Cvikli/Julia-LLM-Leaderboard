Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example implementation in Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    pattern = r'```julia(.*?)```'\n    matches = re.findall(pattern, md, re.DOTALL)  # using DOTALL to make . match any character including newline\n    \n    if not matches: return \"\"\n    \n    code_blocks = [match[0] for match in matches] \n    joined_code = '\\n'.join(code_blocks)\n    \n    return joined_code\n```\nIn this function, I used a regular expression to find all the Julia code blocks. The `re.findall` function returns all non-overlapping matches of pattern in string, as a list of strings. The `DOTALL` flag allows dot (.) to match any character at all, including a newline.\n\nThe extracted code blocks are then joined into one string with newlines between each block. If there were no matches, an empty string is returned. \n\nNote that the regular expression used here will not work if you have more than one set of backticks used for fencing because it assumes a single level of fencing. In practice, it may be necessary to use a more complex pattern to handle such cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,287],"elapsed":2.191745097,"_type":"aimessage"}]
