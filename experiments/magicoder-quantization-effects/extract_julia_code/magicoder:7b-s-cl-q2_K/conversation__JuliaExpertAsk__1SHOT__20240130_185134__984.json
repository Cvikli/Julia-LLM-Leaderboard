Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you might approach this:\n\n```python\nimport markdown\nfrom io import StringIO\nimport sys\nsys.path.insert(0, './')  # for importing from the current directory\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    class JuliaCodeCollector(markdown.inlinepatterns.InlineProcessor):\n        def handleMatch(self, match):\n            return ' ' + self.markdown.htmlStash.store('jl', self.marker)\n    md.output = StringIO()\n    inlinePatterns = md.inlinePatterns\n    \n    class CustomMarkdown(markdown.Markdown):\n        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n            super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n            \n            self.register_extension('fenced_code')\n            self.output = StringIO()  # output gets written here\n            \n    md = CustomMarkdown(extensions=['markdown.extensions.fenced_code'])\n    \n    for ext in md.extensions:\n        md.references['md'].inlinePatterns[ext.__class__] = JuliaCodeCollector(md, ext)\n        \n    md.convert(md.source)\n    \n    code = '\\n'.join([stash.text.strip() for stash in md.htmlStash.get_from('jl')))\n    return code  # return the extracted and joined julia codes as a string\n```\nThis function works by creating an instance of markdown with specific extensions, then registering a custom inline processor for the Julia language block. After conversion, it collects all the text from the 'jl' stash, strips leading/trailing whitespace, then joins them into a single string. The result is returned as the output of the function.\n\nPlease note that this is a simplified version and it might not work perfectly for some edge cases. For example, if there are multiple julia code blocks separated by blank lines, or if there's indentation in the block, this will treat them separately.","status":200,"tokens":[0,460],"elapsed":3.548608598,"_type":"aimessage"}]
