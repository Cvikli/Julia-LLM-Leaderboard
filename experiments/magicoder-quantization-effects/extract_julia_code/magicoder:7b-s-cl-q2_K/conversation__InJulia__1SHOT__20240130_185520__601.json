Python is generally a better choice if we want to use it as an AI assistant.\n\n```python\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # Use regex to find all blocks of code in the markdown document\n    pattern = r'```(.*?)\\n(.*?)```'\n    matches = re.findall(pattern, md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # If there are multiple blocks of code, concatenate them with newline.\n    if len(matches) > 1:\n        return '\\n'.join([m[1] for m in matches])\n    else:\n        return None\n```\nThis function uses a regular expression to find all occurrences of the code block syntax (four backticks followed by any characters, newline, and any characters until four backticks). It then extracts the contents of each match. If there are multiple matches, it concatenates them with newline as required. \n\nNote: This function assumes that markdown adheres to typical syntax rules for fenced code blocks (four backticks around a block of code), and does not handle escaping or other complexities. It's also worth mentioning that the provided regular expression will match any four backticks in your input, so if you're dealing with potentially unsafe inputs, you might want to sanitize or escape those characters before parsing.","status":200,"tokens":[0,330],"elapsed":2.525303949,"_type":"aimessage"}]
