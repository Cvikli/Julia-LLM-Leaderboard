Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can solve this problem using regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # regex pattern to match julia language code blocks\n    block_pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n    \n    matches = collect(eachmatch(block_pattern, md))\n    \n    if isempty(matches)\n        return \"\"\n    else\n        # remove code fences and join the blocks together with a newline\n        code = mapreduce(*, matches; init= \"\") do block\n            replace(block, r\"^```julia\\n|\\n```$\"; init=\"\") \n        end\n        \n        return code\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function works by defining a regular expression pattern to match the markdown code blocks. It then uses `collect` to collect all matches of this pattern in the input string, and mapreduce is used to join these matched blocks together into one string. Note that we are using the greedy `.*?` quantifier in our regex to ensure that all matching blocks are combined, not just the first.\n\nPlease note: This function does not handle nested code blocks or other edge cases as it's quite complex. For more robust solution please consider using a full-featured markdown parser, such as Parsers.jl.","status":200,"tokens":[0,299],"elapsed":2.255525396,"_type":"aimessage"}]
