Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of the function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks\n    regex = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\"s\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(regex, md, count=false))\n    \n    if isempty(matches)\n        return \"\"\n    end\n\n    # Extract the code inside each block\n    codes = mapreduce((m)->split(m.captures[1], \"\\n\"), vcat, matches)\n\n    # Join the codes with a newline and remove code fences\n    return join(codes, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all `julia` language code blocks in the markdown document. It then extracts the content of each block and joins them together with a newline character. The resulting string is returned by the function. If no code blocks are found, an empty string is returned. \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that there are no escaped backticks (`\\``) in your markdown text. If there can be such cases, you may need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,265],"elapsed":4.584258971,"_type":"aimessage"}]
