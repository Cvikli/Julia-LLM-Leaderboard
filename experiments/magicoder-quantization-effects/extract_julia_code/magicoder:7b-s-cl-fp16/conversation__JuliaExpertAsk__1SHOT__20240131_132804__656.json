Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple solution for your problem using Python's `re` module:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # Regex pattern to match code blocks in markdown document\n    pattern = r'```julia(.+?)```'\n    \n    # Find all matches of the pattern\n    matches = re.findall(pattern, md)\n    \n    # Join the matched strings and remove code fences\n    code_blocks = '\\n'.join([match[1:] for match in matches])\n    \n    return code_blocks\n```\n\nThis function works by first defining a regular expression pattern to match all Julia language code blocks in your markdown document. Then, it finds all occurrences of this pattern using `re.findall()` and stores them as a list of strings. \n\nEach string is the contents of a code block, including the backticks (code fences) at both ends. To remove these, we use list comprehension to select only the second element of each tuple in the matches list.\n\nFinally, we join all the code blocks together with newline characters using `'\\n'.join()`. This function will return a single string containing all the code from your markdown document.","status":200,"tokens":[0,278],"elapsed":4.806985342,"_type":"aimessage"}]
