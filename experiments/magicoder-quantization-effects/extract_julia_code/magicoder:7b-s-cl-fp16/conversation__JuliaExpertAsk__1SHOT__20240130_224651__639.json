Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regex\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, greedy=false))\n    \n    # Extract the code from each block and join them together with a newline\n    joined_code = join([match.captures[1] for match in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all Julia language code blocks in the markdown document. It then extracts the code from each block and joins them together with a newline character. \n\nNote: This function assumes that the input `md` is a string representing the markdown document, and it assumes that the code blocks are well-formed (i.e., they start and end with three backticks (```), and the language specified after the first set of three backticks is \"julia\". If these assumptions do not hold true in your actual use case, you may need to adjust this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,267],"elapsed":4.614494683,"_type":"aimessage"}]
