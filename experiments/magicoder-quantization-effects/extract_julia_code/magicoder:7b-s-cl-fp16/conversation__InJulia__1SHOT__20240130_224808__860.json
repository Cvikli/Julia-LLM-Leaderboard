[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of your request in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    # If there are no code blocks return an empty string\n    if isempty(code_blocks)\n        return \"\"\n    end\n\n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = reduce((a, b)->a*\"\\n\"*b, map(x->replace(x.captures[1], \"`\" => \"\"), code_blocks))\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all the code blocks in the markdown document. The `eachmatch` function returns an iterator of matches, and we use `collect` to convert this into a Vector. Then, for each match, we replace the code fences with nothing using `replace`, and finally join all the code blocks together with a newline character.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that there is only one language specified in the code block (in this case, \"julia\"). If you want to extract code blocks for multiple languages, you would need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,300],"elapsed":5.181614022,"_type":"aimessage"}]
