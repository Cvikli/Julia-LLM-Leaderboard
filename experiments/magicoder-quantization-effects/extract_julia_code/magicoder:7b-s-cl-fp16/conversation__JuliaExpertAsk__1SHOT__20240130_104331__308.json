[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise. You're precise and answer only when you're confident in the high quality of your answer.","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Question\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of your request in Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md: str) -> str:\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```julia(.*?)```', md, re.DOTALL)  # find all Julia code blocks\n    \n    if not code_blocks:  # no Julia code found in the input string\n        return \"\"\n    \n    # remove ```julia and newline characters from each block\n    cleaned_blocks = [re.sub(r'```', '', b).replace('\\n', '') for b in code_blocks]\n    \n    # join blocks with a newline, if there are multiple\n    return '\\n'.join(cleaned_blocks)\n```\nThis function uses the `re` module in Python to find all matches of the pattern `'`three backticks`'julia(.*?)'`'`three backticks''` and extract them. The `.replace('\\n', '')` is used to remove newline characters from each code block, and finally, `.join(cleaned_blocks)` combines all cleaned blocks into a single string with newlines in between.\n\nNote: This function assumes that the Julia fences (```julia```) are on their own lines (i.e., not adjacent to other text) as they would be in normal Markdown syntax. If your input might have those mixed up, you'd need a more complex regular expression or additional logic to handle that situation.","status":200,"tokens":[0,344],"elapsed":6.026079991,"_type":"aimessage"}]
