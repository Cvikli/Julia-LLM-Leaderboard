If it encounters a ````...``` block that is not followed by another one, it starts accumulating Julia code. If it finds another block, or reaches end of the document, it stops and joins all the collected blocks together with newline characters.\n\nPlease note: This function assumes that there are no empty lines within the code block. It also doesn't support any other type of language in the ```...``` blocks; only Julia is recognized. The `jl` in the fenced block is not checked, so you could use this function for Python code as well if it is properly identified in the markdown document.","status":200,"tokens":[0,443],"elapsed":7.839496731,"_type":"aimessage"}]
