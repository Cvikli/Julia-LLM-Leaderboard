[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is an example of a function in Julia that fulfills the task description:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    blocks = split(md, \"\\n```\")\n    code = []\n    \n    for block in blocks\n        if startswith(block, \"julia\")\n            lines = split(block, '\\n')\n            code_block = join([line[7:end] for line in lines], \"\\n\") # Removing '```julia' and joining the lines together\n            push!(code, code_block)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(code, \"\\n\\n\") # Joining all blocks with two newlines\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, `split` is used to separate the document into different \"code blocks\". For each of these blocks, the function checks whether it starts with 'julia' (indicating that it contains Julia code). If so, the lines in the block are extracted and joined together. \n\nFinally, all code blocks are joined together with two newlines between them and returned as a string. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is no other language used within the markdown document that could potentially be confused with 'julia'. Also, it doesn't handle escaped characters or multi-line expressions (i.e., those starting with \"\\\"). For these cases you would need to expand the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,320],"elapsed":5.673363877,"_type":"aimessage"}]
