The first part (up to but not including ````\\n`) is the actual code block, which we extract and join together with newline characters.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no indented lines in your Julia code blocks, as it strips out all leading whitespace before joining the blocks together. If your code contains indentation (or other types of formatting), you may need to adjust this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,248],"elapsed":4.276969521,"_type":"aimessage"}]
