[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, Here is how you can implement this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = []\n    start_index = 0\n    while true\n        # Find the next code block\n        index = findnext(\"```julia\", md, start_index)\n        if !isnothing(index)\n            end_index = findnext(\"```\", md, index[1])\n            if !isnothing(end_index)\n                push!(code_blocks, md[index[1]:end_index[1]])\n                start_index = end_index[1] + 3\n            else\n                break\n            end\n        else\n            break\n        end\n    end\n\n    if length(code_blocks) > 0\n        # Join all code blocks into a single string with newline separator\n        return join([replace(x, \"```julia\" => \"\") for x in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n    else\n        return \"\"\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function starts by finding the next ```julia block and then finds the corresponding ending ``` block. The function continues doing this until it can't find a new ```julia block or an ending ``` block, indicating that there are no more code blocks left to be processed. \n\nIf there is at least one code block, it removes the ```julia and ``` fences from each block and joins them into a single string separated by newline characters. If there are no code blocks, it returns an empty string. The `findnext` function is used for efficient searching of strings in Julia, which has a time complexity of O(n). \n\nThe replace function is used to remove the fences from each block and join them into a single string separated by newline characters. This solution assumes that there will not be any nested ```julia blocks within the same markdown document. If this was a possibility, more complex logic would be required.","status":200,"tokens":[0,442],"elapsed":7.851234778,"_type":"aimessage"}]
