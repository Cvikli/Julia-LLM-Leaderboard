[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    blocks = matchall(r\"```julia(.*?)```\", md, flags=re\"s\");\n    \n    # Remove code fences from each block\n    cleaned_blocks = map(stripfirstnewline, map(stripendnewline, blocks));\n    \n    # Join the cleaned blocks together with a newline\n    combined_code = join(cleaned_blocks, \"\\n\\n\");\n    \n    return combined_code;\nend\n```\n\nThe `matchall` function is used to find all occurrences of the pattern in the string. The pattern here is ```julia(.*?)``` which matches any code block surrounded by three backticks (`` ` ``), and the `.*?` makes it non-greedy, so that it doesn't match across multiple blocks.\n\nThe `stripfirstnewline` function removes a newline at the beginning of each string in an array, and `stripendnewline` does the same for the end. \n\nFinally, the `join` function combines all the cleaned code blocks into one string with two newlines (`\\n\\n`) between each block.","status":200,"tokens":[0,301],"elapsed":5.243976387,"_type":"aimessage"}]
