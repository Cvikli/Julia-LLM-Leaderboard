When it encounters a line that starts with ```julia, it assumes we've entered into a julia code block. It removes this ```julia and adds all subsequent lines to our code variable until another line starting with ``` is found. At this point, it returns the entire code. If there are multiple ```julia blocks in your markdown document, they will be joined by newline characters.\n\nPlease note that this function does not consider nested julia code blocks and handles some edge cases like shell/bash scripts.","status":200,"tokens":[88,425],"elapsed":7.462595958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
