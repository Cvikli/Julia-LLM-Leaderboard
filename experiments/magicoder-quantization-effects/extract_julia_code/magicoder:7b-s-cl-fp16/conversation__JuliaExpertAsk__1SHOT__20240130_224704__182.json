Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution using regular expressions:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```julia(.+?)```', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # Concatenate the code blocks and remove code fences\n    joined_code = '\\n'.join([re.sub(r'^```julia\\n|\\n```$', '', block) for block in code_blocks])\n    \n    return joined_code\n```\n\nThis function first finds all the Julia language code blocks in the markdown document using a regular expression that matches ```julia...``` and captures everything inside until it reaches ````. Then, it removes the code fences from each block and joins them together with newline characters.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the input `md` is a string containing the markdown document. The function will return an empty string if no Julia language code blocks are found in the document.","status":200,"tokens":[0,240],"elapsed":4.144602074,"_type":"aimessage"}]
