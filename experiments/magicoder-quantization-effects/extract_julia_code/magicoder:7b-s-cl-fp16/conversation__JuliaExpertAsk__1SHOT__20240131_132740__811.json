Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all Julia language code blocks using regex\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    if isempty(matches)\n        return \"\"  # No Julia code found\n    end\n    \n    # Concatenate all the code blocks into a single string\n    code_blocks = mapreduce(m -> m.captures[1], *, matches)\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join with newline\n    code = replace(code_blocks, \"`\" => \"\") |> x -> split(x, \"\\n\") |> joinwith('\\n')\n    \n    return code\nend\n```\n\nIn the function above:\n- `eachmatch` returns an iterator of matches for the given pattern in the string. \n- `collect` is used to convert this iterator into a Vector. \n- The `.captures[1]` gets the first capture from each match (which is the code block).\n- `|>` is a pipeline operator, which passes the result of the left side to the right side as an argument.\n- `replace` replaces all occurrences of a substring with another substring in a string or collection of strings. \n- `split` splits a string into substrings using a regular expression pattern. \n- `joinwith` joins elements of an array into a single string, placing the given separator between each element.","status":200,"tokens":[0,345],"elapsed":5.961496228,"_type":"aimessage"}]
