Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia solution for your problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all indices of code fences\n    fence_indices = findall(\"```julia\", md)\n    \n    if length(fence_indices) < 2\n        return \"\"\n    end\n    \n    # Extract the code blocks and join them together with a newline\n    code_blocks = map(x -> md[x[1]+9:x[2]-3], @view(fence_indices[2:end]) .+ (0,))\n    return join([replace(code, \"```julia\" => \"\") for code in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function works by first finding all indices of the start and end of each code block. It then extracts these blocks using those indices, removes the \"```julia\" from the blocks, joins them together with a newline, and returns the result. Note that this assumes that every code block is a julia code block (i.e., starts with ```julia). If there are other code blocks in your markdown document, you would need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,275],"elapsed":4.749521811,"_type":"aimessage"}]
