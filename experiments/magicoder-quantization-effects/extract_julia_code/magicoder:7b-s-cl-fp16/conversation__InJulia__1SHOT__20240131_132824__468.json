The regular expression pattern is `\"```julia(.+?)```\", which matches three backticks followed by \"julia\" and then captures everything until it encounters three more backticks. \n\nThe `map` function applies the `strip` function to each element of the array, effectively removing any leading or trailing white space from each code block. \n\nFinally, the `join` function concatenates all the cleaned code blocks together with a newline character between each one.","status":200,"tokens":[0,280],"elapsed":4.834658373,"_type":"aimessage"}]
