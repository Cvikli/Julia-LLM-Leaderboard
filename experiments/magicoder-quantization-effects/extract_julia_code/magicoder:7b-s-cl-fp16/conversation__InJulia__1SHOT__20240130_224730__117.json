[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String.

If a line starts with \"```julia\", it starts recording lines of code until it encounters another \"```\". It then joins all recorded code blocks together with newline characters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,252],"elapsed":4.345031986,"_type":"aimessage"}]
