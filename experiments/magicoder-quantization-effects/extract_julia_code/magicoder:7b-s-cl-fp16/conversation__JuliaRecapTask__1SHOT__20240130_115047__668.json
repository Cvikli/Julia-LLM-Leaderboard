[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple way to extract Julia language code from markdown document using regular expressions:\n```julia\nimport RE\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n    matches = collect(RE.findall(pattern, md))\n    \n    code = join([strip(m) for m in matches], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function `extract_julia_code` takes a string `md`, which is the markdown document, and it uses regular expression to find all Julia language code blocks. It collects these matches into an array and then joins them together with newline characters `\\n`.\n\nNote: The regular expression pattern `\"\"\"julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"\"\"s` will match a string that starts with ````julia`, ends with ``` and has any number of lines in between. The \"s\" flag at the end makes the dot (.) in the regular expression match any character, including newline characters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,237],"elapsed":4.212870739,"_type":"aimessage"}]
