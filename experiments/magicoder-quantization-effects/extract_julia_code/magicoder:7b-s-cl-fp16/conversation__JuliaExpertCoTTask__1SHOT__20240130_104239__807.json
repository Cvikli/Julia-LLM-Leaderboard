Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple approach to solve this task using Python:\n\n```python\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # Find all code blocks and split them into lines\n    code_blocks = md.split('```')\n    lines = [block.strip() for block in code_blocks if block.strip()]\n\n    # Remove any leading or trailing empty lines from each block\n    lines = ['\\n'.join(block.split('\\n')[1:-1]) if block.startswith(\"julia\") else block  for block in lines ]\n    \n    # Join the lines together with a newline, and return as a string\n    code_joined = '\\n'.join(lines)\n    return code_joined\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the input `md` at each occurrence of three backticks (```), which mark code blocks in Markdown. This will leave you with a list where each element is one code block, but not yet cleaned up. \n\nThen, we split lines and remove the first and last line (which are just empty strings as they are created by splitting at '```') and if the block starts with \"julia\" then keep it otherwise remove it from the list.\n\nLastly, join the cleaned lines together with a newline character, and return the resulting string.\n\nThis approach assumes that all code blocks are valid Julia blocks; it won't work correctly for Python or other languages. It also doesn't handle cases where there is more than one line of code in a block. For more robust handling of these edge cases you might need to use a dedicated Markdown parser library and add additional error checking and cleaning steps.","status":200,"tokens":[0,372],"elapsed":6.555265033,"_type":"aimessage"}]
