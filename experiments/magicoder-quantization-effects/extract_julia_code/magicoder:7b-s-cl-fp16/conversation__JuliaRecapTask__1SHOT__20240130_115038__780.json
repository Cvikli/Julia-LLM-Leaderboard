[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function in Julia to accomplish this:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all the code blocks in the markdown document\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed = 1))\n    \n    if isempty(code_blocks)\n        return \"\"  \n    end\n\n    # Remove the code fences and join the blocks together with a newline.\n    joined_code = reduce((a,b)-> string(a, \"\\n\", b), map(x -> x[2], code_blocks))\n    \n    return joined_code \nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to match the Julia code blocks in the markdown document. The `eachmatch` function finds all matches of the regular expression and returns an iterator that can be used with a for loop or other functions that operate on iterators, such as reduce. For each match found, it extracts the text within the code block (`x[2]` because `eachmatch` returns a 3-tuple where the second element is the actual match). The function then joins all these texts together with newline characters in between using the `reduce` function and string concatenation.\n\nNote: This function assumes that there are no nested ``` ``` code blocks. If there could be nested code blocks, you would need a more complex solution to handle that case correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,320],"elapsed":5.697360514,"_type":"aimessage"}]
