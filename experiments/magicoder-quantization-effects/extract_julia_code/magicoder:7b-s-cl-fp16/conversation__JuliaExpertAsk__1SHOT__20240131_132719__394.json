Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use regular expressions to match the code blocks in markdown and then replace the code fences with an empty string:\n\n```julia\nusing README_check: readme_contents, cleanup_code\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all matches of code blocks\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    if isempty(matches)\n        return \"\"\n    end\n\n    # Join the matched strings with a newline\n    joined_code = join([m.captures[1] for m in matches]; '\\n')\n\n    # Remove code fences\n    cleaned_code = replace(joined_code, \"`\" => \"\")\n    \n    return cleaned_code\nend\n```\nThis function assumes that the input `md` is a string containing markdown content. It uses the regular expression `r\"```julia(.+?)```\" to match all code blocks in the markdown document. The `.+?` part of the regex matches any character (except for a newline) between two sets of three backticks (````...```).\n\nThe `collect(eachmatch(...))` function is used to get an array of Match objects, each representing a match of the regular expression in the input string. The array is then converted to a vector using the `collect` function.\n\nFinally, it returns a string that contains all the code blocks in the markdown document, with each block separated by a newline and without any code fences.","status":200,"tokens":[118,353],"elapsed":6.11039973,"_type":"aimessage"}]
