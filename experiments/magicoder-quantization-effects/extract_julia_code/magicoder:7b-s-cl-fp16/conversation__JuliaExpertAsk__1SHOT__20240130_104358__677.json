Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can write this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Find the start and end indices of code blocks\n    code_blocks = eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, 1, true)\n    \n    # Concatenate all the code blocks with newlines in between\n    code = join([m.captures[1] for m in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function works by using a regular expression to find all occurrences of code blocks in `md`. It uses the `eachmatch` function, which returns an iterator that produces matches over the given string. The third argument is the minimum number of captures to return and fourth argument specifies whether to use lazy matching or not.\n\nThe `join` function then concatenates all of these strings together with newlines in between (the second argument is a newline).\n\nPlease note that this code does not remove fences (backticks), but instead assumes that the code blocks are surrounded by three backticks (```), followed immediately by \"julia\". If your markdown might use different formatting, you'll need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,286],"elapsed":5.010430796,"_type":"aimessage"}]
