[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can implement this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regex\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    if isempty(matches)\n        return \"\"  # No julia code found\n    end\n\n    # Extract the code and remove code fences\n    codes = mapreduce((m)->replace(m.captures[1], r\"```\" => \"\"), *, matches)\n\n    # Join all code blocks together with a newline\n    return join([code for code in split(codes, \"\\n\") if !isempty(code)], \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `eachmatch` function to find all occurrences of the pattern \"```julia(.+?)```\" (where `.+?` matches any character (except for a newline)) in the input string. The `collect` function is used to convert this iterator into an array. \n\nThen, it uses the `replace` function to remove the code fences from each match and the `mapreduce` function to join all these codes together.\n\nFinally, it splits the resulting string by newline characters (`\"\\n\"`) and joins them back together with two newlines between each one (to separate blocks of code). If a block is empty, it will be ignored in this process.","status":200,"tokens":[0,335],"elapsed":5.863012352,"_type":"aimessage"}]
