[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might implement this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    if isempty(code_blocks)\n        return \"\"  # Return empty string if no code blocks found\n    end\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = reduce((a, b) -> a * \"\\n\" * b.captures[1], code_blocks)\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all occurrences of Julia code blocks in the markdown document and then removes the fenced code block syntax (````julia\\n...\\n```) from each one. The `reduce` function is used to join all the code blocks together with a newline character between each one.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that there are no nested code blocks in your markdown document, and it doesn't handle any potential errors or edge cases. If you need to handle these situations, you might want to add some error checking and handling code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,292],"elapsed":5.097419186,"_type":"aimessage"}]
