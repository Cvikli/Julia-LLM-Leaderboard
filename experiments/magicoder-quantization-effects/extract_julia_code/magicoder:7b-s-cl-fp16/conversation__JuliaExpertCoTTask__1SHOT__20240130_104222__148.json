Then, we will remove the fences ( ``` ) from the code blocks and join them together. We will use regular expressions to perform these operations. \n\nHere is a function that does exactly what you asked for: \n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regex pattern for finding code blocks in markdown documents\n    pat = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(pat, md))\n\n    code_blocks = [match.captures[1] for match in matches]  # Extracting the content of each capture group\n\n    # Joining all code blocks together with a newline character between them\n    combined_code = join([replace(block, \"```julia\\n\" => \"\") for block in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return combined_code \nend\n```\nYou can then use this function to process your markdown document: \n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\nThis is a second block of julia code.\n```julia\nprintln(\"world, hello!\")\n```\n\"\"\"\n\nprint(extract_julia_code(md))\n```\n\nThe output will be: \n\n```\nprintln(\"hello world\")\nprintln(\"world, hello!\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[254,343],"elapsed":10.344218997,"_type":"aimessage"}]
