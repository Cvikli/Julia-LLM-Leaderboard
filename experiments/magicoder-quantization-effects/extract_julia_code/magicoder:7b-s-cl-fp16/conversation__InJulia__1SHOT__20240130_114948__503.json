[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can write this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown\n    blocks = split(md, \"```\")\n    \n    # Join all the blocks together without their fences\n    code = join([block for (i, block) in enumerate(blocks) if mod(i, 2) == 1], \"\\n\")\n\n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function uses Julia's built-in `split` and `join` functions to separate the markdown into blocks. The idea is that for every pair of consecutive \"code fences\" (either ``` or ````, depending on whether they're opening or closing a block), one will be in even positions while the other will be in odd ones. So we only join those in even positions, which are code blocks themselves.\n\nKeep in mind that this function does not handle edge cases and might give incorrect results if the markdown string has \"```\" within a code block or if there's an odd number of them. It is also assuming that all the language specifications are just two backticks ``` and doesn't take into account any additional language specification before those double backticks. You would need to modify this function according to your needs if these cases could occur in your input `md`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,302],"elapsed":5.293159779,"_type":"aimessage"}]
