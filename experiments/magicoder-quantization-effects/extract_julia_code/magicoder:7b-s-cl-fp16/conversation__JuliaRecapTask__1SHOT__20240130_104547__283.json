[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you might write `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    code_blocks = split(md, \"\\n```julia\")[1:end-1]  # split the markdown into blocks by code fences\n    julia_code = \"\"\n    for block in code_blocks  # iterate over each block\n        lines = split(block, '\\n')  # break up the lines in the current block\n        if length(lines) > 1  # if there's more than one line in the block (exclude fence and empty blocks)\n            clean_code = join([line[2:end] for line in lines], \"\\n\")  # remove code fences and join code lines\n            julia_code *= clean_code * \"\\n\"  # append this to the overall Julia code\n        end\n    end\n    return julia_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first splitting the markdown into blocks based on the `code fences`. Then for each block, it splits up the lines and removes the language identifier at the start of each line (i.e., `\"julia\"`). Finally, it joins all the code together with a newline character.","status":200,"tokens":[0,296],"elapsed":5.242903799,"_type":"aimessage"}]
