[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can implement this:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown.\n    m = matchall(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\", md, flags=re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks with a newline.\n    code_blocks = reduce((x, y)-> x * \"\\n\" * y, m);\n    \n    return String(code_blocks)\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we use regex (`matchall`) to find all code blocks in the markdown. The `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\\\" is a regular expression that matches ```julia\\n...``` type code blocks (where \\n is newline and .*? matches any character 0 or more times, lazily).\n\nThen we join all the code blocks found together with a newline.\n\nNote: `re.DOTALL` flag is used to make dot in the pattern `.` match every character including newline. This is important so that our regex can span multiple lines.\n\nWe convert the result into String and return it as per requirement of task.\n\nPlease note, you'll need to add `import re` at the start of your script if you haven't done this already for using the `re` module (which provides regex functionalities).","status":200,"tokens":[0,322],"elapsed":5.626936342,"_type":"aimessage"}]
