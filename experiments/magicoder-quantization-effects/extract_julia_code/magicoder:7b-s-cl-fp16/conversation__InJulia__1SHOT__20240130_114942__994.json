[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of `extract_julia_code`. The function uses regular expressions to find code blocks, removes the code fencing, and joins them into a single string:\n\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    pattern = r\"```julia(?:.|\\n)*?```\"s\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(pattern, md))\n    code_blocks = [replace(match[2], r\"```\" => \"\") for match in matches]\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression to find all occurrences of the code blocks in the markdown document. The `?` after `.*` makes it non-greedy (i.e., it will stop matching as soon as possible), and `s` at the end of the pattern ensures that newline (`\\n`) characters are considered part of the match.\n\nThen, for each match found, we extract the second element of the tuple (which corresponds to the matched string, excluding the code fences), and replace all occurrences of ``` with nothing in it. The `replace` function does this replacement on a per-line basis (`\".\"`), so that newline characters are preserved as they are.\n\nFinally, we join all the extracted code blocks together into one single string, separated by newline characters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,312],"elapsed":5.466618068,"_type":"aimessage"}]
