[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can use regular expressions to match and extract the content between markdown fenced code tags. Here's how you might write this function:\n\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(pattern, md))\n    code_blocks = join([match.captures[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\n    return replace(code_blocks, r\"\\n^\" => \"\")  # remove leading newline characters\nend\n```\n\nThis function looks for the pattern ````julia\\n(.*?)\\n```, which matches a fenced code block that starts with ```julia and ends with \\n``` (a new line character). The parentheses indicate what we want to capture, in this case, everything between those tags. This is a non-greedy match (.*?) so it stops at the first instance of ending tag, not the last.\n\nPlease note that if you want to handle multiple code blocks with different languages (not only Julia), you'd need to modify the pattern accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,265],"elapsed":4.695731916,"_type":"aimessage"}]
