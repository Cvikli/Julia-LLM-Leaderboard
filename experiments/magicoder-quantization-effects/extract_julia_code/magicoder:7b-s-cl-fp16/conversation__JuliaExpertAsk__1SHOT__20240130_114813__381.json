Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you could implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all occurrences of the code fence (start and end) \n    # and replace them with nothing (remove them)\n    md = replace(md, r\"```julia\" => \"\")\n    md = replace(md, r\"```\" => \"\")\n    \n    # Split the markdown into lines\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    \n    code_blocks = []  # To store all the individual code blocks\n    in_code_block = false  # Flag to indicate if we're in a code block\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```\") && !in_code_block\n            in_code_block = true\n        elseif endswith(line, \"```\") && in_code_block  # If this is the end of a code block\n            in_code_block = false\n            \n            # Add this line to the list of code blocks (without the last three backticks)\n            push!(code_blocks, line[1:end-3])\n        elseif in_code_block  # If we're in a code block and not at the end\n            # Add this line to the current code block\n            append!(last(code_blocks), '\\n', line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    if !isempty(code_blocks)  # If there are any code blocks, join them together with a newline\n        return join(code_blocks, '\\n')\n    else\n        return \"\"  # Return an empty string if there's no Julia code in the markdown\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function works by scanning through each line of the input markdown document. If it encounters a line that starts or ends a code block, it toggles the `in_code_block` flag and adds or removes that line from `code_blocks`, respectively. It also strips off any leading/trailing backticks in each line of code. Finally, if there are any code blocks to join together, it joins them with newline characters. If no Julia code is found, the function returns an empty string.\n\nNote: This function assumes that all Julia code blocks are correctly formed and nested (i.e., a `code`` block never contains another ```block). It will behave unpredictably otherwise.","status":200,"tokens":[118,551],"elapsed":9.736608612,"_type":"aimessage"}]
