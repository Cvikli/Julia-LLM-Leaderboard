It then removes the code fences from each block and joins them into one string with newline characters between each block of code.\n\nPlease note that this is a very simple implementation and might not work perfectly for more complex cases, such as code blocks containing backticks or newlines. For a more robust solution, you would need to use a proper markdown parsing library.","status":200,"tokens":[0,211],"elapsed":3.639102969,"_type":"aimessage"}]
