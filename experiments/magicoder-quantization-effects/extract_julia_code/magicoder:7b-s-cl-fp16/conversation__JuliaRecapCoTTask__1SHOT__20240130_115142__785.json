[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\nusing REPL.REPLCompletions: completions_raw, complete_name\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String; instructions=\"\")\n    blocks = Markdown.parse(md)\n    codes = String[]\n    for block in blocks\n        if isa(block, Markdown.CodeBlock) && (block.language == \"julia\" || instructions==\"extract_all_languages\")  # extract julia code blocks\n            push!(codes, join([string(line.raw) for line in block.content], \"\\n\"))  \n        end\n    end\n    return join(codes, \"\\n\\n\")   # joins the codes with a newline and two extra newlines between each separate codes\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we first parse the markdown string to get the blocks in it. Then we iterate over the blocks and check if they are code blocks (i.e., `Markdown.CodeBlock`) and their language is \"julia\". If so, we append its content as a string to our codes list. Finally, we join all the codes with newline characters between them.\n\nYou can pass in special instructions to extract code from other languages by setting the variable `instructions` to `\"extract_all_languages\"`.\n\nPlease note that you need to install and import the required packages (`Markdown`). In a REPL environment, this could be done using the following command: `import Pkg; Pkg.add(\"Markdown\"); using Markdown`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,350],"elapsed":6.23923583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
