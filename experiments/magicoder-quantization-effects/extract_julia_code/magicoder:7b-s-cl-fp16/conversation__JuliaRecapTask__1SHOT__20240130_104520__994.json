[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The function `extract_julia_code` will be written in Julia itself.\n\n```julia\nimport Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    doc = parse(Markdown.Parser(), md, flavor=Markdown.Flavor())\n    codes = map(doc.content) do x\n        if x.head == :code\n            join(filter(!isempty, map(x -> replace(x, r\"^```julia\\n|```$\", \"\"), x.content)), \"\\n\")\n        end\n    end\n    join(codes, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Markdown` package to parse the markdown document and extract code blocks. It filters out empty lines (which may have been introduced by extra whitespace or line breaks) before joining all the codes together with newline characters.\n\nNote that this assumes that there are no other code fences in the markdown document apart from those used for Julia language, which will not be removed if they exist. If you want to remove those as well, you would need a more complex approach that checks for \"```\" instead of \"`\", or some other specific criteria to identify start and end of a code block.\n\nFor instance, this function could look like:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    doc = parse(Markdown.Parser(), md, flavor=Markdown.Flavor())\n    codes = map(doc.content) do x\n        if x.head == :code && all(!isequal('\\n'), x.content) \n            join(filter(!isempty, map(x -> replace(x, r\"^```julia\\n|```$\", \"\"), x.content)), \"\\n\")\n        end\n    end\n    join(codes, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function checks if the content of code block is only '\\n' and removes it before joining.","status":200,"tokens":[0,444],"elapsed":7.893805998,"_type":"aimessage"}]
