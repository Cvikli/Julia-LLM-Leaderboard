Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can solve the problem:\n\nFirstly, let's write a function to extract all the code blocks from markdown document. In this case, we will be using a simple regular expression to match the pattern of code fences (```...```) in our markdown text.\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_code_blocks(md::String)\n    # Regular expression for matching code blocks\n    regex = r\"```julia(.*?)```\"\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(regex, md, greedy=false))\n    return [m.match[1] for m in matches]  # Extract the matched content\nend\n```\nThis function will return an array of strings, each string being a single code block.\n\nSecondly, let's write another function to remove the fences from our code blocks and join them together with a newline character.\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_and_join(code::String)\n    # Remove fences (```...```) and strip leading/trailing whitespace\n    cleaned = replace(code, r\"^```|\\n```$\" => \"\") |> x -> strip(x)\n    \n    # Join the lines with a newline character\n    joined = join([line for line in split(cleaned, \"\\n\")], \"\\n\\n\") \n    return joined\nend\n```\nThis function will remove the fences from a given string and join all the lines of the code into one single string.\n\nFinally, let's use these two functions to extract and clean all code blocks from our markdown text:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Extract all code blocks from the markdown document\n    code_blocks = extract_code_blocks(md)\n    \n    # Clean and join each code block into a single string\n    joined_code = [clean_and_join(code) for code in code_blocks] |> x -> join(x, \"\\n\")\n\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nThis function will return the complete Julia code as a string.\n\nYou can use this `extract_julia_code` function to extract all the julia code blocks from your markdown document and get a single string of cleaned, joined code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,522],"elapsed":9.247061187,"_type":"aimessage"}]
