Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regex\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, capture=2))\n    \n    # Concatenate the code blocks together with newline characters in between\n    code_blocks = join([String(m) for m in matches], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return code_blocks\nend\n```\nThis function works by searching for ````julia\\n` and `\\n``` patterns in your markdown document. If found, it captures the content between these two patterns as a match and collects them into an array. Then it concatenates all of these matches together with newline characters in between.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is no nested code blocks (i.e., it does not handle cases where you have ```julia\\n``` inside other ```julia\\n...```) and does not remove the language specification (i.e., \"julia\"). If you want to remove these, you will need a more complicated solution.","status":200,"tokens":[0,262],"elapsed":4.584155149,"_type":"aimessage"}]
