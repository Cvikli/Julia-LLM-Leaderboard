[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem by using regular expressions in Julia to match and extract the code blocks from the markdown document. Here's an example of how you might write such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all matches of Julia code blocks\n    blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, seperators=true))\n    \n    # If there are no blocks return an empty string\n    if isempty(blocks)\n        return \"\"\n    end\n\n    # Remove code fences and join the blocks together with a newline\n    code = reduce((a, b)->a*\"\\n\"*b.match[2], map(x->strip(x.match[2]; strip=true), blocks))\n    \n    return code\nend\n```\nIn this function:\n- `eachmatch(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, seperators=true)` is used to find all matches of Julia code blocks in the markdown document. The `.+?` inside the regex pattern `r\"```julia(.+?)```` means \"any character (.) any number of times (+?)\".\n- `collect(eachmatch(...))` converts the iterator returned by `eachmatch` into a vector.\n- If there are no code blocks, an empty string is returned.\n- For each match in `blocks`, `strip(x.match[2]; strip=true)` removes leading and trailing whitespace from the matched code block (including newline characters at the start/end of the block), and `reduce((a, b)->a*\"\\n\"*b.match[2], ...)` joins all these stripped blocks together with a newline character in between.\n- The resulting string is then returned as the output.","status":200,"tokens":[0,406],"elapsed":7.063640747,"_type":"aimessage"}]
