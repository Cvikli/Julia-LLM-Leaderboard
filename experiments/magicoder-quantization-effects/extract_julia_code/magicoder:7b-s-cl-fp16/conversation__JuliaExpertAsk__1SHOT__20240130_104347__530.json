Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of your problem in Julia. This function uses regular expressions to find the code blocks, then it strips away the code fences.\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Matches lines enclosed with backticks (`), but not if they're preceded by a \\ character (i.e., escaped).\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"(?<!\\\\)```\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=0))\n    code_content = [strip(m.captures[1]) for m in code_blocks]\n    return join(code_content, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by using a regular expression to match all the blocks of Julia code between three backticks (```), and then strips away these fences from each block. It assumes that there is at least one newline after every code block (as specified in Markdown rules). \n\nPlease note that this will remove the fences but won't run or interpret the code as it would be a text string at this point. It would need to be executed using Julia's eval function if you want to execute the resulting code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,272],"elapsed":4.761668143,"_type":"aimessage"}]
