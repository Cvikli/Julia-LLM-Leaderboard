If it encounters a line that starts with '```julia', it removes this line from the document (by setting its value to \"\") and scans all subsequent lines until it finds one that starts with '```' (indicating the end of the code block). These lines are then joined together as one code block and added to `code_blocks`. \n\nFinally, all the collected code blocks are joined into a single string using newline characters ('\\n') as separators.","status":200,"tokens":[0,330],"elapsed":5.767568228,"_type":"aimessage"}]
