It then removes the code fences and joins the code blocks into a single string with newline characters. If there are no matches, it returns an empty string. \n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes that the code is well-formed. For example, it expects each code block to be terminated by a newline followed by three backticks (```).","status":200,"tokens":[0,238],"elapsed":4.101087165,"_type":"aimessage"}]
