[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can create such function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Regex pattern to match ``` julia blocks\n    p = r\"```julia.*?((?:.(?!```)|.``)*)```\"s\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(p, md))  \n    \n    code_blocks = String[]  # Array to hold the extracted code blocks\n    \n    for match in matches\n        # Extract content of matched block\n        block_content = match.captures[1]\n        \n        # Remove leading and trailing newlines, then append to code_blocks array\n        push!(code_blocks, strip(block_content))\n    end\n    \n    # Join all blocks together with newline character \n    result = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\nThis function uses a regular expression to find the julia code blocks in the markdown document. It then iterates over the matches and removes leading/trailing newlines before appending them to an array. Finally, it joins all elements of the array with two newline characters. \n\nThis solution assumes that there's at most one julia block per line. If more complex structures are possible (like multiple blocks on a single line), you would need a slightly different approach.","status":200,"tokens":[0,314],"elapsed":5.587002927,"_type":"aimessage"}]
