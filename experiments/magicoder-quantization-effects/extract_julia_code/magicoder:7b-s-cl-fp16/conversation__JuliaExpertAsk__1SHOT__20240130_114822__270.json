Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code block start and end index in the markdown text\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\"s \n    matches = collect(eachmatch(pattern, md)) \n\n    # Join the matched codes without code fences into a single string\n    if isempty(matches)\n        return \"\"\n    else\n        julia_code = join([match[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\n        return julia_code\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions (regex) to find all the code blocks that have \"julia\" as its language. Then it concatenates those blocks together, removing the start and end \"```\". If no Julia block is found, it returns an empty string. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there will be no other types of code fences present in your markdown file. If there could be other kinds of code fences present, a more complex solution would be needed to avoid removing those by accident.","status":200,"tokens":[0,251],"elapsed":4.409008668,"_type":"aimessage"}]
