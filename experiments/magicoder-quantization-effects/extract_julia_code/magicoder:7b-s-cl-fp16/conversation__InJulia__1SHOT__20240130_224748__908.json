[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

It then removes the code fences and joins the code blocks together with a newline. If no code blocks are found, it returns an empty string. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the code blocks are correctly formatted as per the markdown language (i.e., they start and end with three backticks (```), followed by \"julia\" on the next line). It also assumes that there is no other text within the code block that might contain a newline character.","status":200,"tokens":[0,289],"elapsed":4.991413456,"_type":"aimessage"}]
