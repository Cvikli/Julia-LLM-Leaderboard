It then removes the fences from each block and joins them together with a newline character. \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the input `md` is a string containing the markdown document, and that it contains only one type of language (in this case, Julia). If there are multiple types of code blocks in your markdown document, you will need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[88,231],"elapsed":3.976082534,"_type":"aimessage"}]
