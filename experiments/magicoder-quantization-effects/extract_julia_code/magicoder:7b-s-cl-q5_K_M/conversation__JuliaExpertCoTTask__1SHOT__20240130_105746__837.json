[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution to your problem using regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks with julia language\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, capture=2))\n    \n    # Remove the code fences and join the code blocks\n    combined_code = join([replace(m, r\"```\" => \"\") for m in matches], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return combined_code\nend\n```\nThis function works by finding all occurrences of code blocks with julia language using a regular expression, then concatenating and joining them together. The `collect` function is used to make sure that the result is an array of strings, even if there's only one match. Finally, it removes the code fences from each block before combining them all together.\n\nRemember to use `replace(m, r\"```\" => \"\")` instead of `split(m, \"```\")[2]` because this will remove both the opening and closing code fence, not just one of them, which would potentially leave an extra newline at the start or end of your combined code. \n\nThis function assumes that all code blocks in the markdown are valid julia code without any additional formatting (like comments or other special characters). If your data includes blocks with non-julia syntaxes or comments, this function will need to be adjusted accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,323],"elapsed":2.870585603,"_type":"aimessage"}]
