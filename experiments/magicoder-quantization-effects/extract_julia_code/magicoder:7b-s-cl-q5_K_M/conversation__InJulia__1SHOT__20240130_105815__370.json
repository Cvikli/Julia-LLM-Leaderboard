It will then remove code fences and join the blocks together with newline characters. Finally, it will return this combined string of code as a String.\nPlease note that this is an example of how to do this in Julia - you would need to adapt this code depending on what exactly your input `md` looks like.","status":200,"tokens":[0,332],"elapsed":2.923240589,"_type":"aimessage"}]
