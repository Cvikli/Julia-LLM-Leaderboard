Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is a simple solution written in Python using regular expressions:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```julia(.*?)```', md, re.DOTALL) # DOTALL flag for making . match any character at all, including a newline \n    \n    if len(code_blocks) > 1:  \n        code = '\\n'.join([block.strip() for block in code_blocks])\n    else:\n        code = code_blocks[0].strip() # strip() to remove leading/trailing white spaces\n    \n    return code\n```\nIn this solution, `re.findall` finds all substrings where the pattern matches and returns them as a list of strings. The `r'` is used for raw string which treats backslashes (`\\`) as literal characters. `.` matches any character except newline. The `*` means \"match 0 or more times\", so `.*` will match zero or more of any character (except newline). The `?` after the `*` makes the `.*` non-greedy, i.e., it will match up to the first possible occurrence of what follows.\n\nThen we check if there is more than one code block. If yes, we join them together with newline character. Otherwise, we just return the single block after stripping leading/trailing white spaces.","status":200,"tokens":[0,318],"elapsed":2.819962192,"_type":"aimessage"}]
