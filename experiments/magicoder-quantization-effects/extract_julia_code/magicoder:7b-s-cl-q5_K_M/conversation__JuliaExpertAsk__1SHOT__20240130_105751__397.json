Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # Find all code blocks using regular expressions\n    matches = re.findall(r'```julia(.+?)```', md, re.DOTALL) \n    \n    if not matches: return \"\" # Return empty string if no matches found\n\n    # Join the matching strings (code blocks), remove code fences and newline characters\n    return '\\n'.join(match[1:-1].replace('\\n', ' ') for match in matches).strip()\n```\nThis function uses a regular expression to find all occurrences of code blocks marked as `julia` within the markdown document. It then removes the code fencing and newline characters, joining them together with spaces. This effectively converts multiple consecutive lines into one line of text separated by space, similar to how markdown works when it collapses newlines in paragraphs.\n\nThe `.replace('\\n', ' ')` is used to replace all newline characters with a space. This is necessary because Markdown treats multiple spaces as a single space, and replacing newline characters with spaces ensures that the resulting string will be formatted correctly according to how Markdown handles collapsed lines. \n\nThe `strip()` at the end is used to remove leading and trailing spaces in case there are any.","status":200,"tokens":[0,303],"elapsed":2.676123741,"_type":"aimessage"}]
