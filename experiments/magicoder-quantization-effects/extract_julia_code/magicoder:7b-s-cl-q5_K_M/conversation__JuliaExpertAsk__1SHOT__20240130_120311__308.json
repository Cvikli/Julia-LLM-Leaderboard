Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you could define such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all Julia code blocks in the markdown document\n    matches = matchall(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\", md, capture=2); \n    \n    if isempty(matches)\n        return \"\"\n    elseif length(matches) == 1\n        # If there's only one code block, remove the fences and join on a newline.\n        return replace(replace(matches[1], \"`\" => \"\"), \"\\n\" => \"\")\n    else\n        # If there are multiple code blocks, join them all together with a newline in between.\n        joined = join([replace(replace(m, \"`\" => \"\"), \"\\n\" => \" \") for m in matches], \"\\n\\n\")\n        return replace(joined, \"\\n \\n\" => \"\\n\\n\")  # remove extra spaces that might have been introduced\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this function, `matchall` is used to find all the Julia code blocks. The parameter '2' means it should capture only the second group in each match which is the code itself. We use regular expressions (regex) to find the Julia-specific fenced code blocks (````julia\\n(.*?)```), and replace the surrounding backticks (`` ` `` ) with nothing, effectively removing them.\n\nThis function will return an empty string if no Julia code blocks were found, or a single code block joined together without the fences and lines separated by two newlines in between (if there are multiple code blocks). \n\nIf there is only one code block, it removes backticks and joins on a newline. If there are multiple code blocks, it joins them all together with a newline in between. To avoid extra spaces that might have been introduced, it also replaces \"\\n \\n\" with \"\\n\\n\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,431],"elapsed":3.862799985,"_type":"aimessage"}]
