Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple Python solution using regular expressions:\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    pattern = r'```julia\\n(.*?)```'\n    matches = re.findall(pattern, md, re.DOTALL)  # Using DOTALL for matching across multiple lines\n    \n    code_blocks = [re.sub(r'```', '', block) for block in matches]\n    \n    return '\\n'.join(code_blocks) if len(code_blocks) > 1 else ''.join(code_blocks)\n```\nThis function will extract all the code blocks from the markdown document `md` and put them together with newline characters. If there is only one code block, it directly joins them into a string without any newline. The code fences (```...```) are removed using regular expressions.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the code blocks in the markdown adhere to the standard markdown syntax for code blocks.\n\nThis function could be further optimized by making it more specific with respect to the kind of Julia code blocks you are expecting (i.e., those starting with `julia` or those starting with a shebang `#!/usr/bin/env julia`).","status":200,"tokens":[0,284],"elapsed":2.529698048,"_type":"aimessage"}]
