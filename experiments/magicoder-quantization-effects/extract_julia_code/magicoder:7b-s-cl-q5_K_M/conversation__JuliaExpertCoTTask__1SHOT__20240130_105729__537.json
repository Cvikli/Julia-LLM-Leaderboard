[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is the function `extract_julia_code` that will extract the Julia code from the markdown document:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # find all code blocks in md and split them into an array of strings\n    codeblocks = collect.(eachmatch(r\"```julia(.*?)```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    # remove the code fences from each block and join them together with a newline\n    full_code = join([strip(replace(code[2], r\"^```julia\\n|\\n```$\"; m=\"\"), '\\n') for code in codeblocks], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return full_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `eachmatch` function from Julia's Base module to find all occurrences of the regular expression \"```julia(.*?)```\" in your markdown document. This will match any code blocks surrounded by ```julia and ``` but will also include anything between them as a capture group (denoted by `(.*?)`). The `collect` function is used to convert each match into an array of strings, and `eachmatch` returns nothing if no matches are found, so there's no need to handle that case.\n\nThe regular expression `^```julia\\n|\\n```$`\" is used in the replace function to remove the code fences from the matched blocks. This uses lookaheads and lookbehinds (denoted by `?=`) which means \"match if immediately followed by\" and \"match if immediately preceded by\", respectively. The `\\n` is a newline character, and the \"^\" symbol means start of line.\n\nFinally, the join function is used to concatenate all the code blocks together into a single string, with each block separated by a newline \"\\n\". The `strip` function is used to remove any leading or trailing white space from each code block. \n\nPlease note that this will not work correctly if your Julia code includes multi-line strings enclosed in triple backticks (``` ```), because these would be mistaken for code fences. If you have such cases, you may need a more complex regular expression to differentiate between code and triple backtick strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,499],"elapsed":4.494526631,"_type":"aimessage"}]
