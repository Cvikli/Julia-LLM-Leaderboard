It stores these segments in an array. If there are no such blocks, it returns an empty string. If there are any, it removes fences from each block and combines them into a single string with newline characters separating blocks. The result is returned as a String.","status":200,"tokens":[0,258],"elapsed":2.255373907,"_type":"aimessage"}]
