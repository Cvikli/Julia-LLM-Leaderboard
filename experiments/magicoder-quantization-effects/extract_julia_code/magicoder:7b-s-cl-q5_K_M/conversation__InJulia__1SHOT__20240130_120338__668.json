[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String.

It then concatenates these matched strings without the fences and newlines, joining them together with a newline character. \n\nPlease note that this is a simplistic implementation and might not handle more complex or edge-case scenarios like escaped characters within the code blocks. If you need to handle such cases, you should consider using a full fledged markdown parser library in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[0,277],"elapsed":2.422704256,"_type":"aimessage"}]
