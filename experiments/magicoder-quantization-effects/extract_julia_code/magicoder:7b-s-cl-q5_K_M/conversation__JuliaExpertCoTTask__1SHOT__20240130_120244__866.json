[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is your solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md) \n    # Find all code blocks\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    if isempty(matches)\n        return \"\"\n    elseif length(matches) == 1\n        # Remove code fences and join lines with newline\n        code = replace(matches[1][1], r\"^```julia\\n\" => \"\")\n        return code * \"\\n\"\n    else\n        # Concatenate all code blocks together\n        code = join([replace(m[1], r\"^```julia\\n\" => \"\") for m in matches], \"\\n\")\n        return code * \"\\n\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by using a regular expression to find all occurrences of the code block pattern in your markdown. If there's only one match, it removes the fences and joins the lines with a newline. If there are multiple matches (indicating multiple Julia code blocks), it concatenates them together.\n\nNote that this function assumes each code block starts with ```julia\\n, which is the standard syntax for starting a code block in markdown. If your markdown uses different fencing characters or delimiters, you will need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,314],"elapsed":2.792293592,"_type":"aimessage"}]
