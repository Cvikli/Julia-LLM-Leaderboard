If you have different representation of your code blocks, this function would need to be adjusted accordingly. \n\nAlso keep in mind, Documenter package is not included by default with Julia. To add it to your project, run `Pkg.add(\"Documenter\")` command in the Julia REPL.","status":200,"tokens":[88,239],"elapsed":2.121153486,"_type":"aimessage"}]
