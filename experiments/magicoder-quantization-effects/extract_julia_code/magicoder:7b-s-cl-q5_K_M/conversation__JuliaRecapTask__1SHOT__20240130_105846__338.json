[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you can solve this problem using Julia's built-in functions and regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Find all code blocks using regex pattern\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    # Join the matched strings together with a newline character.\n    # Remove code fences from each block and join them into one string\n    return reduce((a, b) -> replace(b, r\"^```julia(.+?)```$\", s\"\\$1\"),  code_blocks, init=\"\")\nend\n```\nIn the above code, `eachmatch` function is used to find all occurrences of the regex pattern in the string. Then, reduce() function is used with a custom function to replace the matched strings with their inner contents (excluding fenced code). \n\nNote: This solution assumes that there are no nested ```julia code blocks``` and that there aren't other types of markdown code blocks inside the julia blocks. If these assumptions are not true, more complex parsing would be necessary.\n\nAlso, this function doesn't handle the case where you have multiline comments or other things inside the ```julia code block```. If such cases are possible in your input, additional pre-processing might be needed to remove them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,319],"elapsed":2.887140403,"_type":"aimessage"}]
