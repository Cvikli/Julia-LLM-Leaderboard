[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is an example function that does what you're asking for:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Find all code blocks using regex\n    code_blocks = matchall(\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, 1);\n    \n    # Join the code blocks with newline characters\n    code_str = join([strip(c) for c in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return code_str\nend\n```\nThis function uses `matchall` to find all occurrences of code blocks that start and end with three backticks ( ``` ). The `join` function is used to concatenate the matched strings with a newline character between each.\n\nPlease note, this is a very simple example and may not work properly if your markdown file has more complex structures or special cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,197],"elapsed":1.757758963,"_type":"aimessage"}]
