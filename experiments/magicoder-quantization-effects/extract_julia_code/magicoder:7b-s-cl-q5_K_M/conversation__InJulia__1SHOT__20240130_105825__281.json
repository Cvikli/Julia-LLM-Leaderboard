[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could do this:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all occurrences of code blocks\n    blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, capture=2));\n    \n    # Remove the code fences from each block and join them together\n    result = reduce((a, b) -> a * \"\\n\" * b, map(x -> replace(x, r\"^```$\" => \"\"), blocks), init=\"\")\n\n    return result;\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to match code blocks. The `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\" pattern matches lines that start and end with a newline, between which there is some text (captured in group 2). The `.*?` makes the match lazy, so it will stop as soon as possible (before the next ```), thus capturing the whole block at once.\n\nAfter this, we just replace each ``` before and after the code with nothing, using another regular expression. Finally, we reduce all captured blocks to a single string, separated by newline characters, because they originally had a newline at their end. \n\nPlease note that `eachmatch` function returns a lazy iterator over all non-overlapping matches in the string. This iterator is consumed when it's iterated over, so if you want to use the result later on, you should collect it into an array (`collect(eachmatch(...))`). Also note that this solution assumes that there are no newlines within your julia code blocks (they would confuse the regular expression).","status":200,"tokens":[0,367],"elapsed":3.239121728,"_type":"aimessage"}]
