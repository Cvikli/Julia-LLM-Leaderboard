[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example solution for your problem:\n```julia\nimport Base.Meta: parse, QuoteNode\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    code = \"\"\n    in_block = false\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_block = true\n            code *= chop(line[end])*\"\\n\" # remove code fence\n        elseif in_block && endswith(line, \"```\")\n            in_block = false\n            code *= chop(line)\n        elseif in_block\n            code *= line*\"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `startswith` and `endswith` functions to check if a line starts or ends with a julia code block. If it does, it removes the fences from that line (`chop(line[end])`) and appends a newline at the end of the extracted code so far (`\"\\\"\\n\"`).\n\nThe function also checks if the current line is inside a code block (i.e., `in_block == true`). If it is, it simply appends that line to the `code` string. \n\nIf not in a block and ends with a julia code block (`\"\\\"end\\\"\"), it sets `in_block = false`.\n\nFinally, the function returns all the extracted Julia code as one long String.","status":200,"tokens":[0,343],"elapsed":3.076226993,"_type":"aimessage"}]
