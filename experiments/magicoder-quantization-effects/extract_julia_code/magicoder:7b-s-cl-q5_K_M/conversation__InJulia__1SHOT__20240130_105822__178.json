The function extract_julia_code will then search for all instances of code blocks in the markdown using the regular expression pattern. It will then strip out any surrounding code fences (` ``` ) and join all extracted Julia language blocks with newline characters.\n\nAlso, please note that this solution is case sensitive to \"```\" i.e., it only matches \"```julia\" exactly without ignoring the case. If you want to match regardless of case, use `r\"```julia(.+?)````i` as your regex pattern.","status":200,"tokens":[0,361],"elapsed":3.184574537,"_type":"aimessage"}]
