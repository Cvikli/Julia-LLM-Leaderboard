[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can use regular expressions to extract the source codes between backticks. Here's how you might create your `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code = [] # array for storing the extracted Julia code\n    \n    # Find all matching patterns in markdown document\n    matches = eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n([^\\\"]*?)\\n```\", md, 1);\n    \n    # Loop over matches to extract and join the codes together\n    for match in matches\n        codeblock = match[1]\n        push!(code, codeblock)\n    end\n    \n    # Join all the code blocks with newline character (\\n)\n    joined_code = join(code, \"\\n\")\n\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nPlease note that this function is very simple and will only work if your markdown document adheres to standard conventions of including source codes in backticks. For more complex use-cases (like nested code blocks, special characters within the code, etc.), you might need a more sophisticated approach.","status":200,"tokens":[0,262],"elapsed":2.346876773,"_type":"aimessage"}]
