If these assumptions are not valid for your use case, you may need a different approach.\n\nAlso note that Python library 'markdown' might not be available by default in some environments. You can install it using pip: `pip install markdown`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,292],"elapsed":2.558259625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
