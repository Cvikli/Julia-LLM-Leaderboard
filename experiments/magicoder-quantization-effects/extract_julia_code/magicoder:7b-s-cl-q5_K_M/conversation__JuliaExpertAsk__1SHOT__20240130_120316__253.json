Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can write this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all julia code blocks\n    blocks = capture_all(\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, true);\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join into single string with newline\n    code = join([block[2] for block in blocks], \"\\n\");\n\n    return code;\nend\n\nfunction capture_all(regex::String, text::String, flags::Bool)\n    matches = eachmatch(Regex(regex, flags ? \"r\" : I), text);\n    return collect(matches);\nend\n``` \n\nThis function first finds all of the Julia code blocks in the markdown document using a regular expression. The `capture_all` helper function is used to get all of the matches and returns them as an array of strings. The captured content from each match is then joined into a single string with newline characters between each block.","status":200,"tokens":[0,227],"elapsed":2.01704015,"_type":"aimessage"}]
