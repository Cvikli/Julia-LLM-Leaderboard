Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Below is a simple implementation in Julia for the above problem statement:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regex\n    codeblocks = matchall(r\"```julia.*?\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, flags=re\"s\")\n\n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks\n    result = mapreduce(*, vcat, codeblocks) do block \n        replace(block, r\"^```julia\\n\" => \"\", r\"\\n```$\" => \"\")\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n\nmatchall(r::Regex, str::String; flags=re\"\" ) = [match(r,str) for _ in 0:count(str,flags)]\n```\nThis function `extract_julia_code` takes a string `md`, which represents the markdown document. It uses Julia's built-in `matchall` function to find all occurrences of code blocks that start with ```julia and end with ``` in the markdown. \n\nFor each matched block, it replaces the first line (which contains \"```julia\") and the last line (which ends with \"```\"), resulting in clean code without fences. It then maps over this collection of blocks using `mapreduce` to concatenate them all into a single string with newline characters.\n\nPlease note, this solution assumes that the markdown document is properly formatted and contains valid Julia code blocks. If there are cases where the document might not be correctly formatted or contain malformed code, you'll need more error handling.","status":200,"tokens":[118,366],"elapsed":3.27315164,"_type":"aimessage"}]
