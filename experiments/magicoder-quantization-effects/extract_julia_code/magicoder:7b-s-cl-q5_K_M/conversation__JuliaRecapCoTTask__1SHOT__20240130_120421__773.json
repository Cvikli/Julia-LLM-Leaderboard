[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's one way to solve this task using regular expressions in Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # find all code blocks with julia language\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```julia(.*?)```', md, re.DOTALL)\n\n    # remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = \"\\n\".join([re.sub(r'```.*?```', '', block).strip() for block in code_blocks])\n    \n    return joined_code\n```\n\nThis function works by first using a regular expression to find all the Julia code blocks in the markdown document, and then it joins these blocks together into one string. The `re.DOTALL` flag is used so that the dot (`.`) in the regular expression will match any character, including newlines.\n\nThe newline and stripped are used to get rid of leading/trailing whitespaces or newlines in each code block. \n\nNote: This function assumes that there is only one level of indentation inside a Julia code block. If there can be multiple levels of indentation, you would need a more complex regular expression or a parser to handle this correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,283],"elapsed":2.542731271,"_type":"aimessage"}]
