Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple solution written in Julia programming language:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regex\n    matches = eachmatch(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, seed=1)\n    \n    codes = String[]\n    for match in matches\n        # Remove the triple backticks and julia declaration\n        code_block = match.captures[1][4:end-3] \n        \n        push!(codes, code_block)\n    end\n    \n    # Join all code blocks into one string with newline character in between\n    return join(codes, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function `extract_julia_code` uses a regular expression to find all the code blocks containing Julia language. It then extracts each code block and removes the fences by slicing (`[4:end-3]`). After that it joins them together with newline characters in between using the `join` function.\nPlease note that this function assumes that every code block is correctly formed, i.e., there are no syntax errors within each code block or they have a correct language specification (here we assume 'julia').","status":200,"tokens":[118,272],"elapsed":2.427101593,"_type":"aimessage"}]
