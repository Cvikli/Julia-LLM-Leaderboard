Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could solve this problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    blocks = filter(x -> x.head == \"code\", parse_blocks(md))\n    \n    codes = map(blocks) do block\n        replace(string(block), r\"```julia\\n|\\n```\" => \"\")\n    end\n\n    join(codes, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `Markdown.jl` package to parse the Markdown document and extract code blocks. It filters out all non-code blocks from the parsed markdown, then maps over each block, removing code fences. The resulting strings are joined together with a newline character.","status":200,"tokens":[0,171],"elapsed":1.501836751,"_type":"aimessage"}]
