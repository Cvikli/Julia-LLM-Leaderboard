Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an implementation of this task in Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```\\n(.*?)\\n```', md, re.DOTALL)  # find all code blocks\n    \n    if len(code_blocks) > 1:  \n        # concatenate all code blocks with newline in between\n        julia_code = '\\n'.join([code for code in code_blocks])\n    elif len(code_blocks) == 1:\n        julia_code = code_blocks[0]\n    else:  \n        julia_code = \"\"\n    \n    return julia_code\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all the code blocks in the markdown document. It then concatenates these together with newline characters between each block, if there are multiple. If there is only one code block, it returns that as a string. If there are no code blocks, it returns an empty string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,236],"elapsed":2.075416013,"_type":"aimessage"}]
