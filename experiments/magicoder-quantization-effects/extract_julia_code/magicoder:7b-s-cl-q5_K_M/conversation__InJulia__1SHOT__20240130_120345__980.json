[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is an implementation in Julia for your request:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    doc = parse_md(md) # Convert the markdown to Document object\n    blocks = []  # Array to hold code blocks\n\n    for block in doc.content\n        if typeof(block) == CodeBlock && occursin(\"julia\", block.language)\n            push!(blocks, block.code)\n        end\n    end\n\n    if length(blocks) > 0\n        return join([strip(block, leading=true, trailing=true) for block in blocks], \"\\n\") # Join code blocks with newline and remove leading/trailing whitespaces\n    else\n        return \"\" # Return empty string if no julia code found\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by parsing the markdown into a Document object, then iterating over each block in the document. If a CodeBlock is found with \"julia\" as its language, it's appended to the `blocks` array. Finally, if there are any blocks collected, they are joined together with newline characters and returned as a single string. If no julia code blocks are found, an empty string is returned.\n\nThe function also removes leading or trailing whitespaces in each block of code before joining them together.","status":200,"tokens":[0,303],"elapsed":2.645486725,"_type":"aimessage"}]
