[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function `extract_julia_code` in Julia that can be used to achieve the task:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    blocks = split(md, \"\\n```julia\")\n    code_blocks = String[]\n    for block in blocks[2:end]  # ignore first element as it is not a Julia code block\n        lines = split(block, \"\\n\")\n        code = join([line[3:-3] for line in lines], \"\\n\")\n        push!(code_blocks, code)\n    end\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function splits the markdown document into blocks using `split`. Then it iterates over each block and removes the first two characters (which are `\"``) and last two characters (which are `\"`) from every line in the block. The resulting code blocks are then joined together with newline character (\"\\n\") to form a single string.\n\nNote: This function assumes that all Julia code blocks do not have any language specification. If there can be other languages like Python or R, you should add checks for those as well.","status":200,"tokens":[0,264],"elapsed":2.61483918,"_type":"aimessage"}]
