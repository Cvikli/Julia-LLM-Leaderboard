Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    blocks = split(md, \"\\n```julia\\n\")\n    code_blocks = [block for block in blocks if startswith(block, \"julia\")]\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks with a newline\n    joined_code_blocks = join([split(block[10:end], \"\\n```\")[1] for block in code_blocks], \"\\n\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code_blocks\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the markdown text into blocks before and after each `julia` code fence, then filtering out any non-code blocks. It then joins the remaining code blocks with newline characters in between. Note that this assumes no indented lines are present within a julia block (as they would be treated as part of the surrounding context).","status":200,"tokens":[0,223],"elapsed":2.147435283,"_type":"aimessage"}]
