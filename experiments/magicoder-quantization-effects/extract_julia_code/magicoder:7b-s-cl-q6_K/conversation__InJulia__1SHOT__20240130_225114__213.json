[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regex\n    blocks = collect.(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = join([replace(block[1], \"`\" => \"\") for block in blocks], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all occurrences of Julia code blocks. It then removes the fences from each block and joins them together with a newline character. Note that this assumes that there are no other backticks in your markdown document, as they would be interpreted as part of the code block. If you have such cases, you might need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,209],"elapsed":1.983902394,"_type":"aimessage"}]
