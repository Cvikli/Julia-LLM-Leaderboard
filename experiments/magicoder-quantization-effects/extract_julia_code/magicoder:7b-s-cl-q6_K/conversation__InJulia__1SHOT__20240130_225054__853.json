[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regex\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    # Extract the content of each block and remove the code fences\n    code_content = map(m -> m.captures[1], code_blocks)\n\n    # Join all blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = join(code_content, \"\\n\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `eachmatch` function from the Base.Regex module to find all occurrences of code blocks in the provided markdown document. It then extracts the content of each block and removes the code fences using regular expressions. Finally, it joins all of the extracted code blocks together with a newline character.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the input `md` is a string containing markdown text. The regular expression used here (`r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\") matches any block of Julia code delimited by three backticks (```), followed by \"julia\", a newline, and then the actual code.","status":200,"tokens":[88,300],"elapsed":2.880453582,"_type":"aimessage"}]
