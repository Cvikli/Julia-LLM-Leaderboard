Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks\n    blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    if isempty(blocks)\n        return \"\"  # No Julia code found\n    end\n\n    # Join the code blocks without fences\n    code = join([m.captures[1] for m in blocks], \"\\n\")\n\n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function uses a regular expression to find all occurrences of code blocks with language `julia`. It then joins these blocks together, removing the fences (``` and ```). If no such blocks are found, it returns an empty string.","status":200,"tokens":[118,181],"elapsed":1.760279349,"_type":"aimessage"}]
