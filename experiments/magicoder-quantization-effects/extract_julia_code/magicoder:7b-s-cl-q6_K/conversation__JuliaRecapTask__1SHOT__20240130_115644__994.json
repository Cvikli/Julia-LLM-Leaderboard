[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can implement this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    codeblocks = []\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            push!(codeblocks, \"\")\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && isempty(codeblocks)\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if endswith(line, \"```\") && !isempty(codeblocks)\n            break\n        elseif !isempty(codeblocks)\n            codeblocks[end] *= line[5:end-3]  # Remove the ```julia and ``` from each line.\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join([strip(c, ' \\t\\n') for c in codeblocks], \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses the fact that markdown uses four back-ticks (`` ` `` ) to indicate a code block. The first line of each code block starts with ```julia, which is why we check for that. When we encounter another pair of three back-ticks (indicating the end of the code block), we append all lines in the current code block into one string and add it to our result list.\n\nThis function also assumes that each code block is standalone and does not interact with others. If there are multiple consecutive code blocks, this function will only keep the last one because it clears out `codeblocks` every time it encounters a new code block. \n\nIt also ignores any lines of code starting with a \"```\", assuming these are intended for markdown purposes and not part of the julia code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,394],"elapsed":3.954134235,"_type":"aimessage"}]
