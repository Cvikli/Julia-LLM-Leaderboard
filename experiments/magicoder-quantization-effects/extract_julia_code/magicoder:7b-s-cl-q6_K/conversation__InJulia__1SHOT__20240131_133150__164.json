It then removes these markers from the captured text, joining them together. \n\nNote: This assumes that there is only one language specified in each code block (i.e., \"```julia\") and not multiple languages are mixed within a single code block.","status":200,"tokens":[0,225],"elapsed":2.147327156,"_type":"aimessage"}]
