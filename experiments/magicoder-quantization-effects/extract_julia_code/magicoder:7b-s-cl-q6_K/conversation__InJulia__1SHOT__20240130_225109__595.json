If no julia code blocks are found, it returns an empty string. \n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\nHere is some text\n\n```julia\na = 1\nb = 2\nc = a + b\n```\n\nMore text...\n\n```julia\nd = 3\ne = d * 4\n```\n\"\"\"\nprintln(extract_julia_code(md))\n```\n\nThis will print:\n\n```julia\na = 1\nb = 2\nc = a + b\n\nd = 3\ne = d * 4\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,364],"elapsed":3.467200984,"_type":"aimessage"}]
