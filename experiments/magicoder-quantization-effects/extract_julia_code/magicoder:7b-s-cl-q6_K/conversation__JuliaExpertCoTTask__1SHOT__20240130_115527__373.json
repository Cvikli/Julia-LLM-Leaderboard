[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this task by using regular expressions to match the code blocks in your markdown document and remove code fences. Here's an example of how you might implement such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # This pattern matches a ```...``` block of code\n    pat = r\"```(.*?)```\"ms\n    # Find all matches of the above pattern in the markdown document\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(pat, md))\n    \n    code_blocks = [match.captures[1] for match in matches]\n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks with a newline\n    joined_code = join([replace(code, \"```julia\" => \"\") for code in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function will extract all Julia code blocks from your markdown document and concatenate them with a newline character. Note that this approach assumes that all code blocks are correctly formatted as ```julia ... ```, where `...` is the actual code. It doesn't handle cases where there might be additional whitespace or other characters before or after \"```\". For more complex markdown documents, you may need to adjust this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,282],"elapsed":2.763956031,"_type":"aimessage"}]
