[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple solution to your problem using regular expressions in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regex\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    # If there are no matches return an empty string\n    if isempty(matches)\n        return \"\"\n    end\n\n    # Join all code blocks together with newline\n    code_blocks = join([match.captures[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Remove the code fences from each block of code\n    cleaned_code = replace.(split(code_blocks, \"\\n\"), \"`\" => \"\")\n    \n    return join(cleaned_code, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function first finds all matches of the regular expression ```julia(.+?)``` in the markdown document. It then joins these together with newline characters to form a single string containing all code blocks. The `replace` and `split` functions are used to remove the code fences from each block of code. Finally, it returns the resulting string.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is only one level of indentation in the code blocks. If there can be multiple levels of indentation, you would need a more complex solution using nested loops and conditionals to handle this.","status":200,"tokens":[0,317],"elapsed":3.015778003,"_type":"aimessage"}]
