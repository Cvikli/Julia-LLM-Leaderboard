[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can approach this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regex\n    matches = eachmatch(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, 1);\n    \n    if isempty(matches)\n        return \"\"\n    end\n\n    # Concatenate all the found code blocks into a single string\n    code_blocks = reduce((a, b)->a * \"\\n\" * b, map(m->match(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", m.match).captures[1], matches))\n    \n    # Remove all new lines and return the result\n    return replace(code_blocks, r\"\\n\" => \"\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to match code blocks in the markdown document. The `eachmatch` function will return an iterator that returns a `Match` object for each match found in the input string. We use `map` to transform these Match objects into strings (the captured content inside the code fences), and then reduce them into a single string with newline characters between each block of code. Finally, we replace all newlines in this string with nothing (`\"\"`) using the `replace` function.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is exactly one matching set of triple backticks for every opening set. If you expect to encounter markdown that doesn't follow this rule (e.g., a missing closing triple-backtick), you will need additional error handling code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,348],"elapsed":3.326695203,"_type":"aimessage"}]
