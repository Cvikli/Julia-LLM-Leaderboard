The resulting strings are joined together with a newline character, creating one long string of Julia code. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is only one language specified for each code block (i.e., ```julia). If you have multiple languages in your markdown document and want to extract all of them, you would need to modify the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,246],"elapsed":2.337831374,"_type":"aimessage"}]
