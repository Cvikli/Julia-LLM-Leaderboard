Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all occurrences of code blocks\n    regex = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(regex, md))\n    \n    if isempty(code_blocks)\n        return \"\"\n    end\n    \n    # Extract and join the code blocks\n    code = mapreduce(m -> m.captures[1], *, code_blocks)\n    \n    # Remove code fences (backticks) from the code\n    cleaned_code = replace(code, \"`\" => \"\")\n    \n    return cleaned_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first finding all occurrences of Julia code blocks in your markdown string using a regular expression. It then extracts and concatenates all found code blocks together into a single string. This is achieved through the use of the `mapreduce` function, which applies the given function to every element of an array (in this case, each match object returned by `eachmatch`) and reduces them in some way (`*`, meaning they are joined together). \n\nFinally, it removes the code fences from the extracted code. This is achieved through a series of `replace` calls that replace all occurrences of backticks with an empty string. The result is a single string containing the concatenated and cleaned code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[0,330],"elapsed":3.237477862,"_type":"aimessage"}]
