If it encounters a line that starts with ```julia (indicating a code block), it finds the next ``` after which the block ends, removes the fences and appends the line to the `code_lines`.\nWhen all code blocks have been found, it joins them together with newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,388],"elapsed":3.764266283,"_type":"aimessage"}]
