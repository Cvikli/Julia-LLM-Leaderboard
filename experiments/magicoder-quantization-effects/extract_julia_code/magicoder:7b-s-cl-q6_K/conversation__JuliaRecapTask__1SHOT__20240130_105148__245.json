[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of `extract_julia_code` in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    codeblocks = split(md, \"```\")\n    jlcode = \"\"\n    for block in codeblocks[2:end]\n        lines = split(block, \"\\n\")\n        if length(lines)>1 && startswith(\"julia\", lowercase(strip(lines[1]))) \n            jlcode *= join([line[4:end] for line in lines], \"\\n\") * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    return strip(jlcode)\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the markdown document `md` into an array of strings divided by the occurrences of ` ``` `. It then checks each block if it is a julia code block. If it's a julia code block, it removes the language specification (if any), and joins the lines with newline. The resulting string is returned after removing leading and trailing white spaces.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that all julia code blocks are preceded by `julia`. If your markdown uses different keywords for specifying languages or if there might be other non-julia language code blocks, you'll need to adjust the condition accordingly.\n  \nAlso, this is a simple implementation and does not take care of edge cases like syntax errors in the code block, comments, multi-line strings etc. In production level code, it would be better to use a proper parsing library for markdown files and julia code blocks specifically.","status":200,"tokens":[0,351],"elapsed":3.508482152,"_type":"aimessage"}]
