[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how to accomplish this task:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Define the regular expressions for finding Julia code blocks and fences\n    re_start = r\"^```.*\"\n    re_end   = r\"```$\"\n    \n    # Find all code block matches in md\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(Regex(re_start), md, 1))\n    \n    if isempty(matches)\n        return \"\"\n    end\n    \n    result = \"\"\n    for i in 1:length(matches)-1\n        start = first(matches[i]) + 3 # Add 3 to account for the fence characters\n        end_match = collect(eachmatch(Regex(re_end), md, start))[1]\n        result *= md[start:end_match.offset-3] * \"\\n\" # Subtract 3 to remove the fences\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to find the starting and ending points of all code blocks in `md`. It then extracts and joins these blocks together, removing the surrounding triple back ticks. Note that we're using Julia's built-in `first` function to get the first match from a collection.\n\nPlease note: this solution assumes that there is only one set of fences per code block. If there are multiple sets of fences (e.g., for use in nested code blocks), or if you want to handle these cases, you would need to adjust the regular expressions and/or the logic of the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,368],"elapsed":3.570958535,"_type":"aimessage"}]
