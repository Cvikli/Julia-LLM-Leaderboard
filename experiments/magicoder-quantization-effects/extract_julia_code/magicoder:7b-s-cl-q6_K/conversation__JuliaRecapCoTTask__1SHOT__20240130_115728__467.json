[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all the code blocks using regex\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n\n    if isempty(matches)\n        return \"\"\n    end\n\n    # Extract and remove code fences from each match\n    codes = map(m -> replace(m.captures[1], \"`\" => \"\"), matches)\n\n    # Join the extracted codes with newline characters\n    code_str = join([code for code in codes], \"\\n\\n\")\n    \n    return code_str\nend\n```\nThis function uses a regular expression to find all occurrences of a ```julia block``` within the markdown document. It then strips off the ``` and \\n characters that surround these blocks to get the raw Julia code. The extracted codes are joined together with two newline characters (\\n\\n) in between, so as to ensure there's a blank line after each block of code when it's outputted.\n\nThis function assumes that each ```julia block``` is on its own line, as per the markdown standard. If there are multiple ```julia blocks``` on one line or within each other (as in nested blocks), they will be treated as a single block of code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,314],"elapsed":3.134439777,"_type":"aimessage"}]
