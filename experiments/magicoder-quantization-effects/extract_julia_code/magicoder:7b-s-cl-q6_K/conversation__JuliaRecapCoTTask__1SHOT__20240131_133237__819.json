[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The function `extract_julia_code` can be implemented using regular expressions in Julia to match and extract the code blocks from markdown document. Here is an example of how it could look:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown\n    codeblocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    if isempty(codeblocks) \n        return \"\" # No Julia code found\n    end\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    code = reduce((x, y)-> x * \"\\n\" * y.captures[1], codeblocks);\n    \n    return code;\nend\n```\n\nThe function `extract_julia_code` matches all occurrences of ```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```, which is the markdown syntax for a code block, and extracts the content inside the fence (between `\\n`). \n\nIf no Julia code blocks are found in the input string, it returns an empty string. If there are multiple Julia code blocks, it concatenates them together with a newline between each one.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that all Julia code blocks in the markdown document are properly formatted and do not contain special characters or escape sequences that might interfere with regular expressions. Also, it does not handle nested code blocks, so if there are any, you may need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,349],"elapsed":3.428474232,"_type":"aimessage"}]
