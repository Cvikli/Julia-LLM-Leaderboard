Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of the function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks\n    code_blocks = collect.(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    # Extract the actual code from each block\n    code_strings = mapreduce(x -> x.captures[1], vcat, code_blocks)\n    \n    # Join all blocks together with newline\n    return join(code_strings, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function first finds all the code blocks in `md` using regular expressions. It then extracts the actual code from each block and joins them together with a newline. The resulting string is the combined Julia code without any code fences.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that your markdown document `md` uses three backticks (```), followed by \"julia\" (without quotes) to denote code blocks, and that each block ends with another set of three backticks. If your markdown uses different conventions for code blocks, you will need a different regular expression or approach altogether.","status":200,"tokens":[0,264],"elapsed":2.522079753,"_type":"aimessage"}]
