We use regular expressions (regex) for this task. The regex pattern `@``[^`]*``@` is used to identify fenced code blocks. This pattern basically matches strings between backticks (`` ` ``), where the characters in between can be any except a backtick, effectively capturing all the code blocks.\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    return join([match(r\"@``[^`]*``@\", str).captures[1] for str in split(md,\"@\") if length(str)>0], \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nNow, let's test the function with a given example.\n\n```julia\nprintln(extract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\n```)) # \"println(\\\"hello world\\\")\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,235],"elapsed":2.345407022,"_type":"aimessage"}]
