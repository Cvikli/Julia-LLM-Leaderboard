Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find the start and end of all code blocks\n    starts = findall(\"```julia\", md)\n    ends = findall(\"```\", md)\n\n    # If there are no code blocks, return an empty string\n    if isempty(starts) || isempty(ends)\n        return \"\"\n    end\n\n    # Combine all the code blocks together with newline characters\n    codes = [md[s+1:e-1] for (s, e) in zip(starts, ends)]\n    combined_code = join([strip(c) for c in codes], \"\\n\")\n\n    return combined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first finding all occurrences of the code fence markers ` ```julia` and ` ``` `. It then slices the string between these markers to get each code block, strips any leading or trailing whitespace from each code block with `strip()`, and joins them together with newline characters. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is a closing fence marker for every opening fence marker. If not all pairs of fences are properly nested, the function will behave unexpectedly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,286],"elapsed":2.740411274,"_type":"aimessage"}]
