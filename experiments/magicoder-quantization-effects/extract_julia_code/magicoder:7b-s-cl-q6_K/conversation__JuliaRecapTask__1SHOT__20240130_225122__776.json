[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

It then joins these blocks together with a newline character. The `reduce` function is used here to sequentially apply a binary operation (in this case, string concatenation) to all elements of an iterable collection.\n\nYou can use it like this:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\nThis is some markdown text.\n\nHere's some code in Julia:\n```julia\nx = 10\ny = 20\nz = x + y\n```\nAnd here's another block of code:\n```julia\na = [1, 2, 3]\nb = a .* 2\n```\n\"\"\"\nprintln(extract_julia_code(md))\n```\nThis will output:\n```julia\nx = 10\ny = 20\nz = x + y\na = [1, 2, 3]\nb = a .* 2\n```","status":200,"tokens":[388,395],"elapsed":3.920710942,"_type":"aimessage"}]
