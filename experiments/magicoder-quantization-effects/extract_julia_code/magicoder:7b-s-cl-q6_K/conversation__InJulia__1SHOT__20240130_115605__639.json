If so, we start reading lines until we hit another ``` or an empty line (indicating the end of a code block). We strip the backticks from the code lines and join them together with a newline character to form each code block. All extracted blocks are then joined together with a newline character to form the final output string. \n\nNote: This function assumes that Julia language blocks in markdown files are always well-formed and correctly nested, i.e., there is no mixed nesting of different languages within one block.","status":200,"tokens":[0,340],"elapsed":3.288236516,"_type":"aimessage"}]
