[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

If it does, we push an empty string onto `code_blocks`. \n- We then check if a line starts and ends with a backtick. If it does, we skip this line (as it's part of a code block in markdown).\n- Whenever we find a line that's not a code block or a line ending a code block, we add the stripped version of this line to the last element of `code_blocks` (this is where our actual Julia code resides).\n- If a line ends with three backticks, we join all lines in the current code block together into one string and remove it from `code_blocks`. \n- Finally, we join all strings in `code_blocks` together with newline characters between them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,469],"elapsed":4.703692522,"_type":"aimessage"}]
