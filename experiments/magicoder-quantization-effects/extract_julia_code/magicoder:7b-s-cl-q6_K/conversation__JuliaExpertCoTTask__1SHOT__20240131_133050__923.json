[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    code_blocks = [match(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", block).captures[1] for block in split(md, \"```\") if startswith(block, \"julia\")]\n    return join([replace(block, \"\\n\" => \"\") for block in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the markdown string into blocks using the `split` function with the markdown delimiter as the argument. Then it filters out any blocks that do not start with \"julia\". The remaining blocks are then matched against a regular expression to find and capture the code within the fences, which is stored in the `captures[1]` element of the match object. This captured code block is removed from its original newline characters using the `replace` function, and all these code blocks are then joined together with newlines using the `join` function.\n\nThis solution assumes that there is only one level of nested code blocks (i.e., if a block contains another \"```\" sequence, it will be treated as part of the outer block). If you need to handle multiple levels of nesting, this approach would need to be modified.","status":200,"tokens":[254,297],"elapsed":9.250889003,"_type":"aimessage"}]
