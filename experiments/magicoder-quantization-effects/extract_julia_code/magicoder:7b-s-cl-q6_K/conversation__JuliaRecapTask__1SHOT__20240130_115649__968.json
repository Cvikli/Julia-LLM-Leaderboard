[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can use regular expressions to solve this problem. The function below uses `replace` and `join` functions from Base library to extract code blocks:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code block markers and replace with nothing (remove code fences)\n    md = replace(md, r\"```\\n\" => \"\",  r\"\\n```\" => \"\")\n    \n    # Split the modified markdown into an array of lines\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    \n    # Initialize an empty string to store code blocks\n    code_blocks = \"\"\n\n    in_code_block = false \n    for line in lines \n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\") || startswith(line, \"```julia-repl\")\n            # If a new code block is found, add newline before previous one (if it's not empty)\n            if !isempty(code_blocks)\n                code_blocks *= \"\\n\" \n            end  \n            \n            in_code_block = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && in_code_block\n            # If a code block ends, add newline after the block and stop looking for blocks\n            in_code_block = false\n            code_blocks *= \"\\n\" \n        elseif in_code_block\n            # Otherwise, append line to the current code block\n            code_blocks *= strip(line) * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return code_blocks\nend\n```\n\nThis function works as follows: it scans each line of markdown. If it encounters a line that starts with \"```julia\" or \"```julia-repl\", it switches into a mode where it collects all subsequent lines until it hits another code block delimiter (another line starting with \"```\"). All collected lines are joined together and returned as the result.\n\nPlease note, this function assumes that there is only one Julia code block in the markdown document. If multiple blocks exist or if they are interleaved with non-code content, the function will not correctly extract them. Also, it does not handle nested code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[0,507],"elapsed":5.100753275,"_type":"aimessage"}]
