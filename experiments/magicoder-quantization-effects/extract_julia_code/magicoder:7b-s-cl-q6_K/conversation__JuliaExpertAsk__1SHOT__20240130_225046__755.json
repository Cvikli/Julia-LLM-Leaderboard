Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of your request in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regex\n    codeblocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    if isempty(codeblocks)  # If no code block found return empty string\n        return \"\"\n    end\n\n    # Join all code blocks together with newline and remove code fences\n    result = join([match.captures[1] for match in codeblocks], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return replace(result, r\"```\" => \"\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to find the Julia code blocks in your markdown document. It collects all matches and then joins them together with a newline. Finally, it removes the code fences from the resultant string using `replace`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,209],"elapsed":1.982750281,"_type":"aimessage"}]
