Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might implement this:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    pattern = r'```(.*?)```' # regex to match code fences\n    matches = re.findall(pattern, md, re.DOTALL)  # find all code blocks and capture their contents\n    joined_code = '\\n'.join(matches).strip()   # join the code blocks with newline and remove leading/trailing whitespace\n    \n    return joined_code\n```\nThis function uses the `re` module to search for any instances of a string surrounded by three backticks (`` `` ` `` ). The `.*?` is a non-greedy match which means it will stop at the first possible instance of the following pattern. The `re.DOTALL` flag allows dot (`.`) in the regex to match newline characters, which is useful when matching across multiple lines.\nThe `strip()` function is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the joined code block.","status":200,"tokens":[0,228],"elapsed":2.211833083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
