[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can implement this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks\n    blocks = matchall(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, greedy=false)\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks with a newline\n    joined_blocks = reduce((a, b)->a*\"\\n\"*b, blocks);\n    \n    return joined_blocks;\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all code blocks in the markdown document. The `matchall` function returns an array of all matches found in a string. \n\nThe regular expression `r\"```julia(.+?)```\" matches any text enclosed by three backticks (````...```) and followed by \"julia\". The `.+?` inside the parentheses is a lazy match, which means it will match as few characters as possible before the next part of the regular expression.\n\nThe `reduce` function then joins all the code blocks together with newline characters between each block. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no nested ``` ``` in your markdown document. If there can be nested code fences, you would need a more complex solution to correctly handle them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,294],"elapsed":2.798889455,"_type":"aimessage"}]
