Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all blocks of code using regex\n    code_blocks = collect.(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    # Join the blocks and remove code fences\n    combined_code = join(map(x -> x.match[2], code_blocks), \"\\n\")\n    \n    return combined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all blocks of Julia code in your markdown document. It collects these into an array, and then joins them together with newline characters. The resulting string contains the raw code without any surrounding markdown formatting or fences.","status":200,"tokens":[0,179],"elapsed":1.758860562,"_type":"aimessage"}]
