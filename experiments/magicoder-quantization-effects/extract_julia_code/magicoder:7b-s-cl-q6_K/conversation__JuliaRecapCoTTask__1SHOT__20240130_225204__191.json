[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document.\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    # Remove the code fences from each block of code.\n    cleaned_code_blocks = map(x -> replace(x.captures[1], r\"^```julia\\n|```$\" => \"\"), code_blocks)\n    \n    # Join all blocks of code together with a newline in between.\n    combined_code = join(cleaned_code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    \n    return combined_code\nend\n```\n\nThe function `extract_julia_code` takes as input the markdown document as a string and returns the combined code blocks of Julia language as a single string. The regular expression used in the `eachmatch` function is looking for all occurrences of the pattern \"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\" (where `(.*?)` captures any characters, but as few as possible) in the markdown document.\n\nThis function assumes that there are no nested code blocks and that each block of Julia code is separated by a blank line. If the input markdown document has other requirements, you would need to adjust this solution accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,327],"elapsed":3.175240135,"_type":"aimessage"}]
