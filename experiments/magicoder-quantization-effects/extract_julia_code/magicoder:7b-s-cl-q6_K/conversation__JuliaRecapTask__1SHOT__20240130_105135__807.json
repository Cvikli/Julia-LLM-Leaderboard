[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

We can use regular expressions in Julia to identify and extract the code blocks from the markdown document. \n\nHere is how we might implement this:\n```julia\nusing REPL.Parsers: CodeFence, MDParser\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)::String\n    parser = MDParser()\n    codeblocks = String[]\n    \n    for (i, el) in enumerate(parser(md))\n        if isa(el, CodeFence) && startswith(el.info, \"julia\")\n            push!(codeblocks, replace(replace(el.string, r\"^```julia(.*)$\" => \"\\$1\"), '\\n' => ' '))\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(codeblocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nIn the function above:\n- We iterate over each element in the markdown document `md` using `MDParser`. \n- If an element is a code block and its info (after the backticks) indicates Julia language (`startswith(el.info, \"julia\")`), we push it to `codeblocks`. \n- We remove the first line of each block which contains the fence (`replace(el.string, r\"^```julia(.*)$\" => \"\\$1\")`) and replace newline characters with spaces.\n- Finally, we join all code blocks together into one string separated by newlines (using `join(codeblocks, \"\\n\")` ).\n  \nThis function will extract the Julia language code from a markdown document, concatenate them together and remove the fences around each block of code. \n\nNote: This assumes that the markdown file is well-formed and does not have any unintended side effects. If the input can be arbitrary, additional error checking might be needed to handle edge cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,465],"elapsed":4.663605337,"_type":"aimessage"}]
