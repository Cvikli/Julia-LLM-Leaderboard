The `.+?` is a lazy quantifier that matches as few characters as possible. Then it removes the code fences and joins the code blocks together with a newline.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no nested code blocks (i.e., it does not handle cases where one code block is inside another).","status":200,"tokens":[0,269],"elapsed":2.556688844,"_type":"aimessage"}]
