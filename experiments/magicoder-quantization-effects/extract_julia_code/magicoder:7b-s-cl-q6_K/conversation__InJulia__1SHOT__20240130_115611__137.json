Then it extracts all the lines that start with four spaces, which are considered to be Julia code blocks in markdown files. All these lines (i.e., each line of Julia code) are joined together into one string separated by newline characters (`\\n`). This function finally returns the resulting string as output.","status":200,"tokens":[0,297],"elapsed":2.868135866,"_type":"aimessage"}]
