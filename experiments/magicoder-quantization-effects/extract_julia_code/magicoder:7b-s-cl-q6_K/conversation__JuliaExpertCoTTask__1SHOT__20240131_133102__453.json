Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    code_blocks = split(md, \"\\`\\`\\`julia\")\n    \n    # Remove the first element (empty string at start of array)\n    popfirst!(code_blocks) \n    \n    # Join the remaining elements (code blocks) together with a newline\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the markdown document into an array where each element is a code block. It then removes the first element of this array (which is always empty due to how split() operates), and joins the remaining elements together with a newline character. This effectively combines all the code blocks into one string, removing any code fences.","status":200,"tokens":[0,198],"elapsed":1.90358081,"_type":"aimessage"}]
