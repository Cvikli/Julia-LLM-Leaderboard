[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might implement this function:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    blocks = Markdown.parse(md, flavor=Markdown.Flavors.github).content\n    code_blocks = [c for c in blocks if typeof(c) == Markdown.Code]  # filter code blocks\n    \n    code_strings = mapreduce((x) -> x.code, *, code_blocks; init=\"\")  \n    replace(\"```julia\\n$(code_strings)\\n```\", \"```\" => \"\")   # remove code fences\nend\n```\nIn the function above: \n- `Markdown.parse` parses the Markdown string into a list of blocks (e.g., paragraph, header, etc.)\n- We use mapreduce to join all the code strings together with no newline (`init=\"\"`). This is equivalent to saying \"for each code block, take its code attribute and join them altogether\".\n- `replace(\"```julia\\n$(code_strings)\\n```\", \"```\" => \"\")` removes the markdown fenced code blocks.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes there is only one Julia language code block in your Markdown document. If there are multiple blocks, they will be concatenated with a newline. If you need to handle multiple blocks separately, you might want to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,321],"elapsed":3.190881971,"_type":"aimessage"}]
