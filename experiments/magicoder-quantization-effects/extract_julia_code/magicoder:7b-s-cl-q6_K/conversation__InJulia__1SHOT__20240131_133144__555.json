[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String.

It then removes the code fences and joins the code blocks together with a newline character. If there are no code blocks, it returns an empty string. \n\nPlease note that this is just one possible solution and you might need to adjust it according to your specific needs or constraints. For example, this function assumes that all code blocks have exactly two lines: one for the opening fence and another for the closing fence. If there are more or less lines, it might not work as expected. Also, it doesn't handle nested code blocks (code blocks inside other code blocks).","status":200,"tokens":[0,314],"elapsed":2.996999084,"_type":"aimessage"}]
