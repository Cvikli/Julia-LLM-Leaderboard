This matches markdown code blocks that contain julia language code. The function then collects all matching blocks, removes the code fences by accessing captures[1], and joins them together with a newline using `reduce`.\n\nFor example, if your input string md contained:\n```julia\n\"This is some text\n\nHere's some code:\n```julia\nfunction test()\n    return 100\nend\n\n\"And here's more text\"\n```julia\nThis function extract_julia_code would return the string \"function test() \\n   return 100 \\n end\".\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,349],"elapsed":3.393137137,"_type":"aimessage"}]
