Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    blocks = Markdown.parse(md) |> collect\n    code_blocks = filter(x -> x.kind == :code, blocks)\n    \n    # remove code fences and join the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline\n    code_str = join([replace(string(block), r\"^```julia\\n|\\n```$\" => \"\") for block in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return code_str\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Markdown.parse` method from the Markdown package to parse the markdown document into an array of blocks. It then filters out any blocks that are not `:code` kind (i.e., those that aren't code fenced julia blocks). The `replace` function is used to remove the code fences, and finally, the `join` method is used to concatenate all the code strings together with a newline character between each one.","status":200,"tokens":[0,247],"elapsed":2.363847044,"_type":"aimessage"}]
