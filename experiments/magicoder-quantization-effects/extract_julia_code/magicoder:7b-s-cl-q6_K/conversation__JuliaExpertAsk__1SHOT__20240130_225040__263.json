Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regex\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    # Extract the actual code from each block and join them together with a newline\n    joined_code = join([m.captures[1] for m in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all occurrences of Julia code blocks in the markdown document, then extracts the actual code from each block and joins them together with a newline. Note that this assumes that there is exactly one line break after the opening fence (````julia\\n`) and before the closing fence (`\\n```). If your markdown documents use different conventions for code fences, you'll need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,227],"elapsed":2.15453871,"_type":"aimessage"}]
