[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple approach using regular expressions to match Julia-formatted code blocks in Markdown files:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Find all code blocks between ``` and ``` \n    regex = r\"```julia(.+?)```\"s\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(regex, md))\n    \n    if isempty(matches)\n        return \"\"\n    end\n    \n    codes = map(m -> m.captures[1], matches)\n    joined_codes = join([replace(code, \"`\" => \"\") for code in codes], \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Remove the leading or trailing newlines \n    joined_codes = replace(joined_codes, r\"^\\s*\\n|\\s*\\n\\s*$\", \"\")\n    \n    return joined_codes\nend\n```\nThis function first uses a regular expression to find all matches of Julia code blocks in your Markdown document. It then maps over the matches, replacing each match's captured text (which includes the ```julia and ```) with nothing, effectively removing it. After this, we join all the remaining codes together with newline characters between them.\n\nThis function assumes that you want to remove leading or trailing newlines from your extracted code as well. If you don't want to do this, just remove the `replace` function call.","status":200,"tokens":[0,307],"elapsed":3.067899595,"_type":"aimessage"}]
