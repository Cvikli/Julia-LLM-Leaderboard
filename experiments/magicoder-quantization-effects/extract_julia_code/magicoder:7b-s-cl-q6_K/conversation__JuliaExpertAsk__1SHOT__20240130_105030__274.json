[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise. You're precise and answer only when you're confident in the high quality of your answer.","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Question\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation in Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```julia\\n(.*?)```', md, re.DOTALL) # find all julia code blocks\n    \n    if not code_blocks:\n        return \"\"  # No code found\n\n    # Join the code blocks together with newline and remove code fences\n    joined_code = \"\\n\".join(code_blocks).replace(\"```julia\\n\", \"\").replace(\"\\n```\", \"\")\n    \n    return joined_code\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions (`re.findall`) to find all the Julia code blocks in the markdown document. If no code is found, it returns an empty string. The `re.DOTALL` flag allows the dot (.) character to match any character (except a newline), which is useful when you want to match across multiple lines.\n\nThe function then joins all the code blocks into one long block with newline characters and removes the code fences (````julia\\n` and `\\n```).\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes that all Julia code in your markdown document is enclosed in triple backticks ``` before and after the code, which is typical for Markdown code blocks. If this isn't the case, you will need a different regular expression or additional logic to handle different formats of markdown code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[0,327],"elapsed":3.201733093,"_type":"aimessage"}]
