[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the Julia code blocks from a markdown document and joins them into one string:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Parse the markdown to HTML\n    html = Markdown.parse(md, format = \"html\")\n    \n    # Find all code blocks in the parsed HTML\n    code_blocks = findall(\"<pre><code class=\\\"language-julia\\\">\", html)\n    \n    # Extract the code from each block and join them together with a newline\n    code = join(split(html[code_blocks], \"</code></pre>\")[1:end-1]; \"\\n\")\n    \n    return code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first parsing the markdown document into HTML using the `Markdown.parse` function, then searching for all occurrences of the specific string that denotes a Julia code block in the HTML (`<pre><code class=\"language-julia\">`). It splits these blocks at the end and starts a new one with `</code></pre>`, removes the last element (which is always an empty string), joins them together with newline characters, and returns the result.\n\nNote that this function assumes that all Julia code blocks are correctly formatted as `<pre><code class=\"language-julia\">` in the markdown document. If there may be other types of code blocks or if they might not be correctly formatted, additional error checking would need to be added.","status":200,"tokens":[0,347],"elapsed":3.388709156,"_type":"aimessage"}]
