Since we're interested in the content inside the backticks (the code fence), we index from 1.\n\nPlease note that Python's regular expression engine doesn't support lookbehind assertions, so we can't remove code fences directly with a single regular expression. Instead, we remove them after extracting all matching substrings using the `[1:]` slicing operation.\n\nFinally, `'\\n'.join(list)` joins all elements in a list into a string with newline characters between each element. If there are no matches (i.e., if the function returns an empty list), it returns an empty string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,328],"elapsed":3.169566119,"_type":"aimessage"}]
