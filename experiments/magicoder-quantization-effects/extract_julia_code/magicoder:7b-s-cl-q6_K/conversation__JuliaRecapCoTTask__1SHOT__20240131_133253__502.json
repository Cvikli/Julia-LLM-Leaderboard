[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you might solve this problem using Python's `markdown` library to parse the markdown document, and then use regular expressions to extract the Julia code blocks:\n\n```python\nimport re\nimport markdown\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    html = markdown.markdown(md)\n    \n    # Extract the code blocks from HTML\n    code_blocks = re.findall('<pre><code class=\"(.*?)\">(.*?)</code></pre>', html, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = '\\n'.join(re.sub('```|<.*?>|\\n', '', block[1]) for block in code_blocks if 'julia' in block[0].lower())\n    \n    return joined_code\n```\n\nThis function first converts the markdown to HTML using `markdown.markdown(md)`. Then it uses regular expressions to find all `<pre><code>` tags with a class attribute containing \"julia\". These are assumed to be Julia code blocks. It then removes code fences (````|<.*?>`) and newlines from each block, and joins them together into one string separated by newlines.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes the markdown document is well-formatted with correct code fencing for Julia language. Also, it only extracts Julia code blocks without considering nested or mixed languages within the same document. \n\nIf there are special instructions provided in `{{instructions}}`, you should incorporate those into your solution according to specific requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,364],"elapsed":3.570843451,"_type":"aimessage"}]
