[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise.

Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of your request:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    blocks = split(md, \"\\n```julia\\n\")\n    code_blocks = [replace(block, \"```\" => \"\") for block in blocks[2:end]]\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the markdown string into an array of strings using the `split` function. The split is made at each occurrence of a code fence (````julia\\n`). The first element of this array (at index 1) will be empty because there's no code before the first code block.\n\nThen, for every subsequent string in the array (from index 2 onwards), it removes the code fences by replacing ```` with an empty string using the `replace` function. Finally, it joins all these strings together into one string separated by newline characters (`\\n`).\n\nNote: This implementation assumes that there are no other language blocks in your markdown file and that each code block is a complete piece of Julia code. If this is not the case, you would need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,272],"elapsed":2.584132925,"_type":"aimessage"}]
