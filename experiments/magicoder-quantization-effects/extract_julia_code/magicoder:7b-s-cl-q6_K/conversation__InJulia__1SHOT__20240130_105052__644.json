Then it removes the language identifier \"```julia\" from each block and joins them together with a newline. The function then returns this concatenated string as output.\n\nPlease note that this assumes that there are no nested code blocks in your markdown file, and that all Julia code blocks are formatted correctly with triple backticks (```) and \"```julia\" at the start of each block. If you have different formatting or have nested code blocks, this function might not work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[0,297],"elapsed":2.885098441,"_type":"aimessage"}]
