Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an implementation of your problem in Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # Find all code block content using regular expression\n    blocks = re.findall(r'```(?:julia|)([\\s\\S]*?)```', md, re.MULTILINE)\n    \n    # Concatenate the code blocks and remove code fences\n    joined_code = '\\n'.join([block.strip() for block in blocks])\n    \n    return joined_code\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to match all ``` ``` (triple backticks) enclosed code blocks. It then joins the content of these matched blocks with newline characters and removes any leading or trailing whitespace.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the provided markdown document only contains Julia language code blocks and no other kind of fenced code blocks. If there are mixed kinds of code blocks in your documents, you may need to modify the regular expression accordingly.\n\nAnd also, keep in mind that the way markdown code block is parsed may depend on your markdown parser library if you're using one (like mistune for Python). You might want to check with the documentation of whatever markdown parser library you are using.","status":200,"tokens":[0,279],"elapsed":2.730980759,"_type":"aimessage"}]
