Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution written in Julia using Regular Expression:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Find all code blocks using regex\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia.*?\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, greedy=false))\n    \n    # Join the contents of each match removing backticks and joining with newline\n    code_blocks = join([replace(m.captures[1], \"`\" => \"\") for m in matches]; \"\\n\")\n    \n    return code_blocks\nend\n```\nThis function uses `eachmatch` to find all instances of the code block pattern, then extracts and joins the contents of each match after removing backticks. The result is a single string containing all Julia code blocks from the markdown document.\n\nNote: This function assumes that the input `md` is a String and will return an error if it's not. It also doesn't handle nested or mixed languages within the same file, as Markdown files usually don't support this.","status":200,"tokens":[118,242],"elapsed":2.384769678,"_type":"aimessage"}]
