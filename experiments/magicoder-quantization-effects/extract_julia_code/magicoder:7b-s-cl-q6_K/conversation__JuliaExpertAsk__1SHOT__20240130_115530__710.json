Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I can create such a function for you. Here's how we might write it in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = [match.captures[1] for match in eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=0)]\n    if isempty(code_blocks)\n        return \"\"\n    elseif length(code_blocks) == 1\n        return code_blocks[1]\n    else\n        return join([replace(strip(block), \"\\n\" => \" \") for block in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to match and extract the Julia language code blocks from your markdown document. It captures all lines between ```julia\\n and \\n``` as a capture group, excluding the fences themselves. Then it joins these captured groups into a single string with newline characters replacing original newlines. \n\nHowever, please remember that this function only works correctly if the markdown file is properly formatted: code blocks are correctly delimited by `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", where \".*?\" matches any character (except for a newline) between two consecutive pairs of newlines. If your markdown document contains malformed code blocks, this function will fail to extract the correct information.","status":200,"tokens":[118,315],"elapsed":3.082806927,"_type":"aimessage"}]
