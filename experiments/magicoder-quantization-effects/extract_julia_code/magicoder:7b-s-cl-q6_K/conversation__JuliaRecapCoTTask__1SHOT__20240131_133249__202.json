[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this task in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks\n    matches = eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\", md, greedy=false);\n    \n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    code = join([match.captures[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Remove code fences\n    return replace(code, r\"```\" => \"\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all the Julia code blocks in the markdown document and extracts their contents. The `eachmatch` function returns an iterator over matches, and we use a list comprehension to extract the contents of these matches. The resulting strings are then joined together with a newline character. Finally, the code fences are removed from the resulting string using the `replace` function.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that there is exactly one level of indentation in each code block (i.e., all lines start with at least four spaces). If your markdown files have different indentation levels or other formatting, you will need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,269],"elapsed":2.632486442,"_type":"aimessage"}]
