[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Find all code blocks and strip their fences (``` or ~~~) \n    blocks = replace.(eachmatch(r\"```julia|~~~julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s, md), r\"^.*?\\n|\\n.*?$\" => \"\")\n    \n    # If there are multiple code blocks, join them with a newline\n    if length(blocks) > 1\n        return join(blocks, \"\\n\")\n    else\n        return blocks[1]\n    end\nend\n```\nThe `eachmatch` function returns an iterator of the matches in the string. The regular expression `r\"^.*?\\n|\\n.*?$\"` will match any newline characters at the start or end of a block. The `replace.` function applies a replacement to each element in an array and returns it as a new array. \n\nThis solution assumes that the language specified right after ``` or ~~~ is \"julia\". If there could be different languages, you would have to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[388,266],"elapsed":2.679375476,"_type":"aimessage"}]
