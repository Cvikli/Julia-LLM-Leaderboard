Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of your request in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regex pattern for finding code blocks\n    block_pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n    \n    matches = collect(eachmatch(block_pattern, md))\n    \n    if isempty(matches) \n        return \"\"\n    end\n    \n    # Concatenate all code blocks together with newline in between\n    code = join([m.captures[1] for m in matches], \"\\n\")\n    return code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression to find all code blocks that have the language specified as \"julia\". It then collects all of these matches and concatenates them together with newline characters between each match. If there are no matches, an empty string is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,197],"elapsed":1.883567112,"_type":"aimessage"}]
