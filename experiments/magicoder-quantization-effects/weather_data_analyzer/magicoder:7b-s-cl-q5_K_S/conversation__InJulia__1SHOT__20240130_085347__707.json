We're going to use the Statistics package to calculate the mean, maximum and minimum temperatures. The trend of the data will be calculated based on the difference between two consecutive temperatures: if it is positive, then the trend is increasing; if it is negative, then the trend is decreasing; otherwise, the trend is stable.\n\nHere is a function `weather_data_analyzer` that fits your needs:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Check if list of temperatures is empty\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    # Calculate the mean, maximum and minimum temperatures\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n  \n    # Calculate the trend (increasing/decreasing/stable)\n    if length(temps) == 1\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif temps[2] - temps[1] > 0.0\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif temps[2] - temps[1] < 0.0\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n  \n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nNote: This function assumes that the `temps` list contains only numbers and is sorted in ascending order. If these assumptions do not hold, you need to add additional code to handle them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,391],"elapsed":3.340719246,"_type":"aimessage"}]
