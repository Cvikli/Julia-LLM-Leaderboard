Note that we have used the `Statistics` package for basic statistical operations and assumed that if there are 3 or more consecutive days where temperatures were increasing, the weather is \"increasing\". Similarly, if there are 3 or more consecutive days where temperatures were decreasing, the weather is \"decreasing\".\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics: mean, minimum, maximum\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    n = length(temps)\n    \n    # Handle edge case where list is empty\n    if n == 0\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg_temp = mean(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n\n    if n >= 3\n        diffs = [temps[i+1] - temps[i] for i in 1:n-1]\n        if all(x -> x > 0, diffs)\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif all(x -> x < 0, diffs)\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n    else\n        trend = nothing\n    end\n    \n    return (average=avg_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function will compute the average, maximum and minimum temperature from the given list of daily temperatures. It also checks if there are 3 or more consecutive days with an increasing (positive difference) or decreasing (negative difference) temperature and sets the `trend` accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,400],"elapsed":3.441127364,"_type":"aimessage"}]
