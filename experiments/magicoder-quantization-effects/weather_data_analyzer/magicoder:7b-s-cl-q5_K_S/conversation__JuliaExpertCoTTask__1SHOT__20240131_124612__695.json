Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you would solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    trend = ifelse(max_temp > average, :increasing, \n                   (min_temp < average) ? :decreasing : :stable)\n\n    return (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nIn this code, the `weather_data_analyzer` function takes a list of temperatures as input. If the list is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperature from the list, then determines the trend based on these statistics. The trend is classified as `:increasing` if the maximum temperature is greater than the average, `:decreasing` if the minimum temperature is less than the average, and `:stable` otherwise.\n\nYou can test this function with your example like so:\n```julia\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,332],"elapsed":2.868539841,"_type":"aimessage"}]
