Note that you'll need to install the Statistics package for the `mean` and `extrema` functions. You can do so by running Pkg.add(\"Statistics\") in your Julia console or REPL. \n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    (minimum, maximum) = extrema(temps)\n\n    if maximum > minimum\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif maximum < minimum\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=average, max=maximum, min=minimum, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nIn this function:\n- We first check if the list is empty. If it is, we return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n- If the list isn't empty, then we calculate the average temperature (mean of temps), minimum and maximum temperatures (extrema of temps).\n- Then we check if the max temperature is greater than the min. If it is, we say the trend is increasing. If the max temperature is less than the min, we say the trend is decreasing. If neither condition is met, then the trend is considered stable (equal maximum and minimum). \n- Finally, we return a named tuple containing the average, maximum and minimum temperatures, along with the trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,374],"elapsed":3.226250392,"_type":"aimessage"}]
