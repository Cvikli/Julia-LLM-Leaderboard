Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation in Julia. It uses the Statistics package for basic statistics and checks if there's any trend based on the first two elements.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nstruct WeatherDataAnalysis <: NamedTuple{\n  :average, :max, :min, :trend\n}\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n    minTemp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if length(temps) < 2\n        return (; average=avg, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    firstTwoDiff = temps[1] - temps[2]\n    if firstTwoDiff > 0\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif firstTwoDiff < 0\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function works by first checking if the input list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Then, it computes the mean (`avg`), maximum (`maxTemp`), and minimum (`minTemp`) of the data. If the size of the data is less than 2, then it determines the trend as being either increasing, decreasing, or stable based on whether the difference between the first two elements are positive, negative, or zero respectively. Finally, it returns a named tuple containing all computed values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,402],"elapsed":3.482764879,"_type":"aimessage"}]
