Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia solution for your problem:\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n    minTemp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if maxTemp - avg > 0\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif avg - minTemp > 0\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=avg, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nIn this function, we first check if the input list is empty. If it is, we return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, we calculate the average temperature, maximum and minimum temperatures and use them along with some basic logic to determine the trend based on these statistics. The function then returns a named tuple containing these calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,255],"elapsed":2.202889952,"_type":"aimessage"}]
