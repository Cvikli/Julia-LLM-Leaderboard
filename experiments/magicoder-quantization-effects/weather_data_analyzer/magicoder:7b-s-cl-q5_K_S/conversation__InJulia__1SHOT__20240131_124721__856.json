Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia using the `Statistics` package:\n\nFirstly, make sure you have the necessary packages installed. You can install them via the Pkg REPL mode by typing:\n```julia\n]add Statistics\n```\nThen, here is a possible solution for your problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        maxT = maximum(temps)\n        minT = minimum(temps)\n        \n        diffs = diff(temps)\n        if all(diffs .> 0, dims=1)\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif all(diffs .< 0, dims=1)\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n        \n        return (average=avg, max=maxT, min=minT, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list of daily temperatures is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\nIf the list is not empty, it calculates the average temperature, maximum and minimum temperatures using functions from the `Statistics` package. Then, it computes the differences between consecutive days in the list, and checks if they are all positive (indicating an increasing trend), negative (indicating a decreasing trend) or mixed (indicating a stable trend).\nFinally, it returns a named tuple containing the calculated average, maximum, minimum temperatures and the identified trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,405],"elapsed":3.47857266,"_type":"aimessage"}]
