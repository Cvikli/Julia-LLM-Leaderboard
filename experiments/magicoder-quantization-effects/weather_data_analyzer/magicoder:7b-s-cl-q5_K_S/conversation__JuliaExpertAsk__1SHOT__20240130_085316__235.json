Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you might write this Julia function. We will use the Statistics package for calculations and NamedTuple from Base package for constructing the output:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics # need this package\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)  # handle empty input list\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    stats = (average=mean(temps), \n             max=maximum(temps), \n             min=minimum(temps))\n\n    diffs = abs.(diff(temps))\n    if sum(diffs .> 0) > 0\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif sum(diffs .< 0) > 0\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; stats..., trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list of temps is empty, if so, returns a named tuple with `nothing` as values for all keys. If it's not empty, then calculates the average, max and min temperatures using mean, maximum and minimum functions respectively from Statistics package. Then it finds out the trend by checking whether the temperature data has increased or decreased over consecutive days.\n\nIf it's increasing over consecutive days, return `:increasing`. If it's decreasing or no changes (stable), returns `:decreasing` or `:stable`, respectively. The result is returned as a named tuple using `; key1=value1,key2=value2` syntax for construction.","status":200,"tokens":[0,376],"elapsed":3.25281496,"_type":"aimessage"}]
