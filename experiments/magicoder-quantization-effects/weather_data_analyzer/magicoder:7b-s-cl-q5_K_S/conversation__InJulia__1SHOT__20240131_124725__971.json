Note that I am assuming that `temps` are stored as an array of integers:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    diffs = diff([min_temp; temps; max_temp])\n    \n    if all(diff .>= 0, diff)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(diff .<= 0, diff)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the `temps` array is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf the `temps` array is not empty, it calculates the average (`avg`), maximum (`max_temp`) and minimum (`min_temp`) temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package. \n\nIt then calculates a series of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list, which can be used to identify whether the temperature data is increasing or decreasing over time. If all differences are positive, it sets the trend to `:increasing`. If all differences are negative, it sets the trend to `:decreasing`. Otherwise, if there's a mix of positive and negative differences, it sets the trend to `:stable`. \n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple with the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,427],"elapsed":3.66362267,"_type":"aimessage"}]
