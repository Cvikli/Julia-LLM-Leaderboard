Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Firstly, ensure that you have the Statistics package installed. If not, install it with the Pkgadd package from the Julia package manager.\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"Statistics\")\n```\n\nThen, we can define our function `weather_data_analyzer` and use the `Statistics` package to perform statistical analysis on the data provided.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)  # If list is empty, return named tuple with all values set to nothing.\n        return (; average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)  # Compute the mean temperature from the list of temperatures.\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)  # Find the maximum temperature in the list.\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)  # Find the minimum temperature in the list.\n    \n    if average > max_temp  # Determine the trend based on whether the mean is above or below the highest daily temp.\n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif average < min_temp\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average = average, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = trend)  # Return named tuple with the results.\nend\n```\nFinally, you can call the function `weather_data_analyzer` on your list of daily temperatures:\n```julia\ntemps = [25, 27, 23, 20, 22]\nprintln(weather_data_analyzer(temps))\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,402],"elapsed":3.500320368,"_type":"aimessage"}]
