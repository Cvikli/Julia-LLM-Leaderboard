Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you might write this function in Julia. Note that I am assuming that the `Statistics` package is already installed and imported.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if avg > max_temp\n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif avg < min_temp\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list of temperatures is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf the list is not empty, it calculates the average (`avg`), maximum (`max_temp`), and minimum (`min_temp`) temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package. \n\nThen, it checks if the average temperature is greater than or less than the maximum or minimum temperature, respectively, to determine the trend. If the average is greater than both the max and min, the trend is `:decreasing`. If the average is less than both the max and min, the trend is `:increasing`. Otherwise, if neither condition is met, the trend is `:stable`.\n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple containing these calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,397],"elapsed":3.357555318,"_type":"aimessage"}]
