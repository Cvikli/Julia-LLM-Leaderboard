Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you could implement this in Julia. The `Statistics` package provides functions for computing basic statistics like mean, maximum and minimum. For determining trend we will use simple linear regression model.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics \n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    x = [1:length(temps);]'\n    y = temps\n    coefs = fit(LinearRegression{Float64}, x, y).coefs\n    \n    if coefs[2] > 0\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif coefs[2] < 0\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf the list is not empty, it calculates the average temperature (`avg`), maximum and minimum temperatures. Then it fits a linear regression model to the data using the `fit` function from the `Statistics` package. The coefficients of this model are used to determine whether the trend of the temperatures is increasing, decreasing or stable. \n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple containing these calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,385],"elapsed":3.316865613,"_type":"aimessage"}]
