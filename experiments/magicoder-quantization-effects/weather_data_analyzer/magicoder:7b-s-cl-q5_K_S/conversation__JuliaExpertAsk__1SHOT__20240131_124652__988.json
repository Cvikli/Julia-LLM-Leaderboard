Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem in Julia. \n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if avg > max_temp\n            trend = :decreasing\n        elseif avg < min_temp\n            trend = :increasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n\n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this function, we first check if the length of `temps` is zero. If it's zero, we return a named tuple with all values set to nothing. \n\nIf there are temperatures in the list, we compute the average (`avg`), maximum (`max_temp`) and minimum (`min_temp`). We then determine the trend based on these three statistics: if the average is greater than `max_temp`, we say that the trend is decreasing; if it's less than `min_temp`, we say that the trend is increasing; otherwise, we say that the trend is stable. \n\nFinally, we return a named tuple containing these computed values and the trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,342],"elapsed":2.93716825,"_type":"aimessage"}]
