If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you can approach this problem using Julia. You need to install the Statistics package first by running Pkg.add(\"Statistics\") in your Julia console.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        diffs = diff([min_temp; temps; max_temp])\n        if all(x -> x < 0, diffs)\n            trend = :decreasing\n        elseif all(x -> x > 0, diffs)\n            trend = :increasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n        \n        return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. \n\nIf the list isn't empty, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures using the mean(), maximum() and minimum() functions from the Statistics package. Then it computes the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list (with min_temp at both ends) and checks if all values are negative or positive to determine the trend. \n\nFinally, it constructs and returns a named tuple with these calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,362],"elapsed":3.114287938,"_type":"aimessage"}]
