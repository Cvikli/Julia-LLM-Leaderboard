Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem by using the built-in statistics package in Julia. The function 'Statistics.mean' computes the mean of a list of numbers, and 'extrema' returns a tuple containing the minimum and maximum values. Additionally, you can use List comprehension to get the trend based on the comparison between consecutive elements.\n\nHere is a sample code that solves the problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Check if the list is empty\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    maximum = extrema(temps)[1]\n    minimum = extrema(temps)[2]\n    \n    # Determine the trend based on comparison between consecutive elements\n    trend = ifelse(all(x-> temps[i+1] > temps[i], @view temps[2:end]), :increasing, \n                   ifelse(all(x-> temps[i+1] < temps[i], @view temps[2:end]), :decreasing, :stable))\n    return (; average=avg, max=maximum, min=minimum, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nYou can use the function `weather_data_analyzer` with your data as follows:\n\n```julia\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n```\nThis will return a named tuple containing the average, max, min and trend of the given temperatures.","status":200,"tokens":[0,385],"elapsed":3.359095695,"_type":"aimessage"}]
