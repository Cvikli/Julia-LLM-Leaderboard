Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could write this function in Julia using the Statistics package. This code assumes that your daily temperature data is stored in an array called `temps` and that it is sorted from earliest to latest date:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if avg > first(temps) && avg < last(temps)\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif avg < first(temps) && avg > last(temps)\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n        \n        return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list of temperatures is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. If not, it calculates the average (`avg`), maximum (`max_temp`), and minimum (`min_temp`) temperatures from the data. It then determines the trend based on whether the average temperature is greater than or less than both the first and last elements of the list (indicating an increase or decrease, respectively). Finally, it returns a named tuple containing these calculated values.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that your daily temperature data is sorted from earliest to latest date. If it's not, you may need to sort it before passing it into the `weather_data_analyzer` function.","status":200,"tokens":[154,402],"elapsed":3.426098482,"_type":"aimessage"}]
