Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you might write this function in Julia using the Statistics and DataFrames packages. Note that there are various ways to calculate trend, I use simple moving average for demonstration purpose here.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\nimport DataFrames:DataFrame, push!\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        df = DataFrame()\n        push!(df, :Temperature => temps)\n        \n        avg_temp = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n        trend = ifelse((avg_temp - moving_average(df[:Temperature], window=3)) > 0, \"increasing\", ifelse((avg_temp - moving_average(df[:Temperature], window=3)) < 0, \"decreasing\", \"stable\"))\n        \n        return (; average = avg_temp, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThe `moving_average` function is used to calculate the simple moving average for trend detection. This can be replaced with any other suitable method based on your requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[154,313],"elapsed":2.718165586,"_type":"aimessage"}]
