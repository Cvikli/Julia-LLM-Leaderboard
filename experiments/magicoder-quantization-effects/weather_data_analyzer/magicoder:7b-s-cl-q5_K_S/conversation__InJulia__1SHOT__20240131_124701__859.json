Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple solution in Julia. This code uses the `Statistics` package for calculating statistics and `NamedTuple` for constructing the result as a named tuple:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if avg > max_temp\n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif avg < min_temp\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n``` \nThis function first checks if the `temps` list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average temperature (`avg`), maximum and minimum temperatures, and then determines the `trend`. The trend is determined by comparing the average temperature to the maximum and minimum temperatures. If the average is greater than the maximum, the trend is `:decreasing`; if it's less than the minimum, the trend is `:increasing`; otherwise, the trend is `:stable`. Finally, it returns a named tuple with these calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,343],"elapsed":2.933538824,"_type":"aimessage"}]
