Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can implement this in Julia using the Statistics package. Note that we are assuming that the temperature data is given as an array of integers:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        average = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if average > max_temp\n            trend = :decreasing\n        elseif average < min_temp\n            trend = :increasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n        \n        return (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the `temps` array is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the Statistics package. It then determines the trend based on these calculated values. If the average temperature is greater than the highest recorded temperature, the trend is set to `:decreasing`. If it's less than the lowest recorded temperature, the trend is set to `:increasing`. Otherwise, if none of these conditions are met, the trend is set to `:stable`. Finally, it returns a named tuple containing these calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,356],"elapsed":3.0468788,"_type":"aimessage"}]
