Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        trend_symbols = Dict(:increasing=>\"↑\", :decreasing=>\"↓\", :stable=>\"•\")\n        trend = ifelse(avg > max_temp, :decreasing, ifelse(avg < min_temp, :increasing, :stable))\n        \n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend_symbols[trend])\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- The function `weather_data_analyzer` takes in a list of daily temperatures. \n- It first checks if the list is empty and returns an appropriate named tuple if it is.\n- If the list isn't empty, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures.\n- The trend is determined by comparing the average temperature to both the maximum and minimum temperatures. \n- A dictionary `trend_symbols` is used to map the trend symbol to the corresponding string representation for clarity in output.\n- Finally, it returns a named tuple with the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,349],"elapsed":3.015360406,"_type":"aimessage"}]
