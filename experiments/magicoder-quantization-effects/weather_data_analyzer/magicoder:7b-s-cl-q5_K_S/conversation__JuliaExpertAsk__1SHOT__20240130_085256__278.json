Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can write this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n    minTemp = minimum(temps)\n\n    if average > maxTemp\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif average < minTemp\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else \n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=average, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first checking if the `temps` list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf `temps` is not empty, it calculates the average temperature using the `mean` function from the `Statistics` package. It then finds the maximum and minimum temperatures using the `maximum` and `minimum` functions. \n\nFinally, based on the calculated averages compared to the max and min temps, it determines the trend (increasing if average > maxTemp, decreasing if average < minTemp, stable otherwise) and returns a named tuple with these values.","status":200,"tokens":[184,316],"elapsed":2.754884984,"_type":"aimessage"}]
