Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n    minTemp = minimum(temps)\n\n    if average > first(temps)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif average < first(temps)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=average, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first checking if the list of temperatures is empty. If it is, a named tuple with `nothing` values for all fields is returned. \n\nIf there are temperatures, we calculate the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package respectively. \n\nWe then check if the average temperature is greater than or less than the first temperature in the list to determine the trend of the data. If it's greater, we label the trend as `:increasing`. If it's less, we label the trend as `:decreasing`. Otherwise, we label it as `:stable`. \n\nFinally, we return a named tuple containing these calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,350],"elapsed":3.027515636,"_type":"aimessage"}]
