Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia using the Statistics package.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    trend = ifelse(max_temp > avg, :increasing, ifelse(min_temp < avg, :decreasing, :stable))\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks whether the `temps` list is empty. If it's empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing.\n\nIf the list is not empty, it calculates the average (`avg`), maximum (`max_temp`) and minimum (`min_temp`) temperatures from the list using the mean, maximum and minimum functions from the Statistics package respectively. \n\nThen it determines the `trend` based on whether the maximum temperature is greater than the average, sets it to `:increasing`; if not, it checks whether the minimum temperature is lesser than the average, in which case it sets the trend to `:decreasing`. If neither of these conditions are true, then the trend is set to `:stable`.\n\nFinally, the function returns a named tuple containing the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,354],"elapsed":3.046112831,"_type":"aimessage"}]
