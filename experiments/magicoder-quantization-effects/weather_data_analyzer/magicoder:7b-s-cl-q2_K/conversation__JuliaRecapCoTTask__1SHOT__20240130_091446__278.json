X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers).

The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`).

It would be helpful if we know what kind of \"Special Instructions\" you are referring to. Below is a basic implementation that doesn't take special instructions into account. \n\n```julia\nusing Statistics: mean, extrema, pmin, pmax\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        temps = [isnan(t) ? nothing : t for t in temps] # Remove NaN values if any.\n        average = isnothing(mean(temps)) ? nothing : mean(temps)\n        (minimum_temp, maximum_temp) = extrema(temps)\n        min = isnothing(minimum_temp) ? nothing : minimum_temp\n        max = isnothing(maximum_temp) ? nothing : maximum_temp\n        \n        trend = if minimum_temp <= maximum_temp \n            :increasing \n        elseif minimum_temp > maximum_temp\n            :decreasing\n        else \n            :stable\n        end\n        \n        return (; average=average, max=max, min=min, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function checks whether the input list `temps` is empty. If it's not empty, it calculates the mean and extrema values of the list. If there are NaN values in the list, they are replaced by `nothing`. Then, based on these calculated values it determines a trend (increasing, decreasing, or stable) and returns a named tuple containing these calculated statistics. If the input list is empty, all returned values are set to nothing.","status":200,"tokens":[0,398],"elapsed":3.171446937,"_type":"aimessage"}]
