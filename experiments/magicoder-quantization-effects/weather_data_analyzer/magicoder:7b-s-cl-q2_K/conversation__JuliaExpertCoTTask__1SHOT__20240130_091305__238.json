Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you could implement this in Julia:\n\nFirstly, we need the Statistics package for our calculations. You can add it to your `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` files (if they do not exist yet, create them) like so:\n```\n[packages]\nJuliaMath = \"5756134e-bd2a-50cf-8e9b-2bb7f01c196a\"\n\n[manifest]\n```\nAnd run `import Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()` in your Julia REPL to install it. \n\nThen, you can implement the function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        stats = map(temp -> temp >= 0 ? :increasing : :decreasing, temps)\n        return (average=mean(temps), max=maximum(temps), min=minimum(temps), trend=unique([stat for stat in stats if !isempty(findall((x)->x==stat,stats))]).val)\n    end\nend\n```\nIn the function, we firstly check if our data is empty. If it's true, then we return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \nIf not, we calculate the statistics (average, max, min temperatures) and determine the trend by checking whether each temperature value is greater than or equal to zero. We use map and filter functions for this purpose. Then, we iterate over our data and find out a unique trend by checking all possible trends in `stats`. If there are multiple unique trends, we choose one that appears most frequently (if not, then we pick the first one).\n\nNow you can test your function with:\n```julia\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,467],"elapsed":3.659357198,"_type":"aimessage"}]
