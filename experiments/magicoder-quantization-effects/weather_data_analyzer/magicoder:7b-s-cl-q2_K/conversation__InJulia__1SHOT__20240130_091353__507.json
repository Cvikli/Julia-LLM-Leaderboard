Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package).

Note that you have to install Statistics package before running the following code:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        diff = max_temp - min_temp\n        if diff > 0\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif diff < 0\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n\n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nYou can call the function with a list of daily temperatures as follows:\n\n```julia\ntemps = [23.5, 24.0, 25.8, 23.9, 23.6, 21.3] # example data\nprint(weather_data_analyzer(temps))\n```\n\nThis will return a named tuple containing the average, maximum, minimum temperature and the trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,307],"elapsed":2.326337171,"_type":"aimessage"}]
