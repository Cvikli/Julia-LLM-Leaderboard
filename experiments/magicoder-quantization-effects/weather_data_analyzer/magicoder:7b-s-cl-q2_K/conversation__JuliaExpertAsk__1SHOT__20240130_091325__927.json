Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you might write this Julia program:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics: mean, maximum, minimum\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = round(mean(temps), digits=2) # 2 decimal places\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if temps == fill(avg, length(temps))\n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:stable)\n    elseif temps[1] < avg  # temperature list is decreasing\n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:decreasing)\n    else\n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:increasing)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty. If it is, then it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing.\nIf the list has elements, it computes the average temperature, the maximum and minimum temperatures, and determines the trend based on whether the daily temperature data is increasing or decreasing. It uses Julia's `Statistics` functions for mean, max, and min calculations. If all days had the same temperature (checked via equals), it declares it as \"stable\". Otherwise, if it was increasing or decreasing, it flags the trend accordingly.\n\nRemember to run this piece of code in a Julia environment where Statistics package is already installed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,393],"elapsed":3.033194558,"_type":"aimessage"}]
