Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia programming language, the function can look as follows:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n    minTemp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if maxTemp - minTemp > 0\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif maxTemp - minTemp < 0\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=avg, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nIn this function, the `mean` and `maximum` functions from the `Statistics` package are used to calculate the average and maximum temperature. The minimum temperature is calculated using the `minimum` function. The trend is then determined based on whether the difference between the maximum and minimum temperatures is positive or negative. If they're equal, it's considered as :stable.\n\nIf the input list of daily temperature data is empty, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,293],"elapsed":2.286648372,"_type":"aimessage"}]
