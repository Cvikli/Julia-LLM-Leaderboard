[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics  # You need to add 'Statistics' package\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)  \n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)  \n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps) \n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if avg > max_temp || avg < min_temp\n            trend = :decreasing  # or ':increasing' depending on how you define a trend\n        else\n            trend = :stable  \n        end\n        \n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this function, we first check if the input list is empty. If it's empty, we return a named tuple with `nothing` for all values because there isn't any data to analyze. \n\nIf the list is not empty, we calculate the average (`mean`), maximum (`maximum`), and minimum temperatures using the statistical functions provided by the 'Statistics' package. Then we check if the average temperature is higher than the maximum or lower than the minimum temperature. Depending on this condition, we assign either `:increasing`, `:decreasing` or `:stable` to `trend`.\n\nFinally, we return a named tuple containing the average, maximum and minimum temperatures along with the trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,360],"elapsed":2.906774041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
