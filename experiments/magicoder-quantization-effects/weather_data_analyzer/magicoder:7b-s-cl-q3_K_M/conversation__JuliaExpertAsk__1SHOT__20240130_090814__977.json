Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can accomplish this by utilizing the `Statistics` standard library and writing your own custom function. Here's an example of how you could structure your function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics  # Import the Statistics package for statistical operations.\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)   # Check if the list is empty.\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)   # Return a named tuple with nothing values.\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)  # Calculate average temperature.\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)  # Find the maximum temperature.\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)  # Find the minimum temperature.\n        \n        trend_data = [(temps[i]-temps[i-1]) for i in 2:length(temps)]   # Generate a list of sequential difference to get the trend.\n        if isempty(trend_data) || all(x -> x == 0, trend_data)   # Check if the trend data only contains zeros or it's empty.\n            trend = :stable   # If yes, then it's considered as stable trend.\n        elseif first(trend_data) > 0   # Otherwise, check the first difference and determine the trend based on the sign of the difference (positive is increasing, negative is decreasing).\n            trend = :increasing\n        else\n            trend = :decreasing\n        end\n        \n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)   # Return a named tuple with the results.\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list is empty or not. If it's empty, then it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures and determines the trend based on sequential difference of the temperatures. The trend can be either `:increasing`, `:decreasing` or `:stable` (`:stable` is when the temperature does not increase or decrease).","status":200,"tokens":[184,495],"elapsed":3.967406701,"_type":"aimessage"}]
