Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution using Julia's built-in statistical and data manipulation libraries:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        average = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        # Determining Trend\n        if average > temps[1]\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif average < temps[1] \n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n    \n        return (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list of temperatures is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average temperature, maximum and minimum temperatures and determines the trend based on whether the average has increased or decreased from the initial value in the list.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the first element (temps[1]) is representative of the trend for the entire dataset; if you have different conditions for identifying an \"increasing\" or \"decreasing\" trend, you may need to adjust this logic accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,330],"elapsed":2.59853191,"_type":"aimessage"}]
