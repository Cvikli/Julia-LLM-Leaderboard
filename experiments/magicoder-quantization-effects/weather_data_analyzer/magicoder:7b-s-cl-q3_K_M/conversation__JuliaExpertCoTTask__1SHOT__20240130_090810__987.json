Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can implement the function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    trend_symbol = nothing\n    \n    if first(temps) > last(temps)\n        trend_symbol = :decreasing\n    elseif first(temps) < last(temps) \n        trend_symbol = :increasing\n    else \n        trend_symbol = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average = avg, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend=trend_symbol)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the `temps` array is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. If not, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package respectively. Then, it checks the trend by comparing the first element of the array (`first(temps)`) with the last one (`last(temps)`). If the first temperature is higher than the last one, the trend is set to `:decreasing`. If the first temperature is lower, the trend is `:increasing`. If the trend can't be determined, the trend is set to `:stable`. Finally, it returns a named tuple containing the average, maximum and minimum temperatures as well as the trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,388],"elapsed":3.01164725,"_type":"aimessage"}]
