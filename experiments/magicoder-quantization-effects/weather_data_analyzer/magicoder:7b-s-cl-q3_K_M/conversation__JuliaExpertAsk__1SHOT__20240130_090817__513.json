Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's how you might implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    nt = (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return nt\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    if avg > 0.0\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif avg < 0.0\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function works by first creating a named tuple with `nothing` values for all the fields that will be filled. Then it checks if the input list of temps is empty and if so, returns the initialized named tuple. If the list isn't empty, it calculates the average temperature, maximum temp, minimum temp, and the trend (increasing, decreasing or stable). It then constructs a new named tuple with these values and returns this.","status":200,"tokens":[0,288],"elapsed":2.258908042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
