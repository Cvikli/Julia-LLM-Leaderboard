Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you might implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        diff = diff(temps)\n\n        if all(diff .== 1, 2:length(diff))\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif all(diff .== -1, 2:length(diff))\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n        \n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list is empty. If it is, it constructs a named tuple with all values set to nothing. \nIf there are temperature data, the function calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures using `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions respectively. \nIt also computes the difference of consecutive days' temperatures. If this difference is always positive, it means the temperature has been increasing day after day; if all differences are negative, it means the temperature has been decreasing day after day; otherwise, it means the temperature has remained stable. Finally, it constructs and returns a named tuple with these computed values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,352],"elapsed":2.76821165,"_type":"aimessage"}]
