The Statistics package is used for calculating statistical properties like average, max and min temperatures:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average = nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    trend_temp = ifelse(max_temp > min_temp, :increasing, (max_temp < min_temp ? :decreasing : :stable))\n\n    return (average=average_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend_temp)\nend\n```\nIn this function: \n- We first check if the list is empty. If it's so, we return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n- Then, we calculate average temperature using `mean` function from Statistics package.\n- Maximum and minimum temperatures are calculated respectively by `maximum` and `minimum` functions.\n- The trend is determined based on whether the maximum temperature is greater than or less than the minimum one: `:increasing` if max > min, `:decreasing` if max < min and `:stable` otherwise. \n- We finally return a named tuple with calculated values for `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures and `trend`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,348],"elapsed":2.71120057,"_type":"aimessage"}]
