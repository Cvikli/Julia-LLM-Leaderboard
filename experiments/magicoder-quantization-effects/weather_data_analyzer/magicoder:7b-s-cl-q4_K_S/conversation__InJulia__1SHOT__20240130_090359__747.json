Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you can solve this problem using Julia. Note that I used the Statistics package which provides functions to compute statistics.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)  # if the list is empty, return all-nothing named tuple\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)  # calculate average temperature\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)  # find the highest temperature\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)  # find the lowest temperature\n    \n    if avg > max_temp || avg < min_temp\n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif avg == max_temp && max_temp == min_temp\n        trend = :stable\n    else\n        trend = :increasing\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)  # create and return named tuple\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first checking if the list `temps` is empty. If it is, then it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures, and determines the trend based on these statistics. Finally, it constructs and returns a named tuple containing these results.","status":200,"tokens":[0,328],"elapsed":2.553895325,"_type":"aimessage"}]
