Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure. Here's how you can solve this problem using Julia programming language:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics # To use statistics functions\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps) # If the list is empty, return a tuple with all values set to nothing.\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    tempStats = describe(temps)  # use Statistics package's function to get statistical properties of temps data\n\n    averageTemp = tempStats[3][\"mean\"]   # mean is at index 3 under the key \"mean\" in 'tempStats'\n    maxTemp = tempStats[3][\"max\"]       # max is at index 3 under the key \"max\" in 'tempStats'\n    minTemp = tempStats[3][\"min\"]       # min is at index 3 under the key \"min\" in 'tempStats'\n    \n    trendVal = (maximum(temps) == temps[1]) ? :increasing : (:decreasing)   # Check if maxTemp occurs first in 'temps', set 'trend' accordingly.\n\n    return (; average=averageTemp, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trendVal)  # Return results in named tuple\nend\n```\nThis code calculates the statistical properties of your data (like `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum`), checks if this maximum occurs first in the list to determine the `trend` and finally constructs a named tuple with all those values. If the input list is empty, it returns a tuple with all its elements set to `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,377],"elapsed":2.956878848,"_type":"aimessage"}]
