Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution using Julia programming language. The `Statistics` package is used for statistical analyses:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        stats = map(StatsBase.mean, StatsBase.extrema, temps)\n        average, (minVal, maxVal) = stats[1], stats[2]\n        if maxVal > minVal\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif maxVal < minVal\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n        return (; average=average, max=maxVal, min=minVal, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, the `isempty` check first checks whether the list of temperatures is empty. If it's empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. Otherwise, it computes the average and extrema (min and max) of the list of temperatures. Then, it compares these two numbers to determine the trend. If maxVal > minVal, then the trend is `:increasing`. If maxVal < minVal, then the trend is `:decreasing`, otherwise if they're equal, the trend is `:stable`. Finally, it constructs and returns a named tuple with these computed statistics.","status":200,"tokens":[0,343],"elapsed":2.688506139,"_type":"aimessage"}]
