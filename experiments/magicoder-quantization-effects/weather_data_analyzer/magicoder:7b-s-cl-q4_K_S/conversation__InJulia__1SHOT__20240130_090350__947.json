Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, we can achieve this using the built-in Statistics package and named tuples for storing data. Here's how you could implement this:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics  # import statistics package\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)  \n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)  \n    maxTemp = maximum(temps) \n    minTemp = minimum(temps) \n    \n    if length(unique(diff([maxTemp; temps]))) == 0\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif diff([maxTemp; temps])[1] > 0\n        trend = :increasing\n    else \n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n    \n    return (average=average, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list is empty and returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing` in such cases. If the list has data, it calculates the average, maximum, minimum temperature using functions from the Statistics package. It also checks for any trends by taking difference of successive temperatures (it assumes that if all differences are 0, then the trend is stable). The result is a named tuple containing the average, maximum, minimum and trend values.\n\nRemember to install the Statistics package using `]add Statistics` in Julia command prompt or package manager before running this function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,352],"elapsed":2.741757514,"_type":"aimessage"}]
