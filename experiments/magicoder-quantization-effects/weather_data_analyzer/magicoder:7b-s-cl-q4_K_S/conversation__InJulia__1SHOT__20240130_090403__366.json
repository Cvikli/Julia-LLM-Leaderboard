Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple Julia solution for this problem. The Statistics package is required and it can be added using Pkg.add(\"Statistics\").\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    average_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if length(temps) < 2\n        return (average = average_temp, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = nothing)\n    end\n    \n    trend_list = diff([min_temp; temps])\n    if all(x -> x > 0, trend_list)\n        return (average=average_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=\"increasing\")\n    elseif all(x -> x < 0, trend_list)\n        return (average=average_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=\"decreasing\")\n    else\n        return (average=average_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=\"stable\")\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. \n\nIf not, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from Statistics package. Then it uses a short list (with at least two elements) for trend analysis. If all differences in the list are positive, then it returns that the trend is increasing. If all differences are negative, then it returns that the trend is decreasing. If there's any mix of positive and negative values or if the list contains only one element, it returns that the trend is stable.\n\nRemember to include Statistics package before running this function using `using Statistics`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,474],"elapsed":3.709009773,"_type":"aimessage"}]
