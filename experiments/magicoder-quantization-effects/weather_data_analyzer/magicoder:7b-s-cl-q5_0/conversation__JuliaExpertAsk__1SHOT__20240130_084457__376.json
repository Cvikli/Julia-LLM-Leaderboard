Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia. Firstly, make sure that the Statistics package is installed by using the Pkg module:\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"Statistics\")\n```\nThen you can define your function `weather_data_analyzer` like so:\n```julia\nusing Statistics \n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n    minTemp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if avg < maxTemp && avg > minTemp \n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif avg > maxTemp && avg < minTemp \n        trend = :decreasing\n    else \n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=avg, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function takes a list of daily temperatures as input and returns a named tuple containing the average, maximum, minimum, and trend. It first checks if the temperature list is empty. If it is, the function returns `nothing` for all four values. Otherwise, it calculates the mean (`avg`), the maximum (`maxTemp`), and the minimum (`minTemp`) of the temperatures. Then, based on these values, it determines which trend applies: increasing temperature if the average is less than both the max and min, decreasing if the average is greater than both the max and min (and equal to one another), or stable if all other conditions are not met. Finally, it constructs and returns a named tuple containing these calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,407],"elapsed":3.493657957,"_type":"aimessage"}]
