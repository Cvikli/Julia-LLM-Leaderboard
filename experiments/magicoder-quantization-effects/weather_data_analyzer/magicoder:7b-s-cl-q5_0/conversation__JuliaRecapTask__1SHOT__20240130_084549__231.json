[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can create such a function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics  # for calculating mean and other statistical functions\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        average = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        trend = temps[1] > temps[2] ? :increasing : (temps[1] == temps[2] ? :stable : :decreasing)  # Assuming temperature increases gradually from early to late in the day.

If it is, we return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, we calculate the `average`, `max`, and `min` temperatures using `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions respectively from the Statistics package. \n\nThen, we use conditional expression to determine if the temperature trend is increasing, decreasing or stable based on comparing the first two temperatures. We assume that the temperature gradually increases throughout the day (increasing trend). If you have different requirements for determining the trend, you will need to adjust this part of the code. \n\nFinally, we return a named tuple containing all these computed values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,359],"elapsed":3.198042081,"_type":"aimessage"}]
