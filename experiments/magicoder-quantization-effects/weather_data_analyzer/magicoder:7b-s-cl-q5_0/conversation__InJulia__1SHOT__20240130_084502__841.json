Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is an implementation of your request in Julia. Please note that you will need to install the Statistics package if it's not already installed by running `using Pkg; Pkg.add(\"Statistics\")`. \n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # If the list is empty, return a named tuple with all values set to nothing\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Determine the trend based on the difference between consecutive temperatures\n    diffs = diff(temps)\n    if all(x -> x > 0, diffs)\n        return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:increasing)\n    elseif all(x -> x < 0, diffs)\n        return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:decreasing)\n    end\n\n    # If the trend is not consistent, it's considered as stable\n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:stable)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the input list `temps` is empty. If so, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. Then, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures from the list using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions respectively from the Statistics package. \n\nThe trend of temperature change is then calculated by comparing the differences between consecutive elements in the `temps` array. If all these differences are positive (indicating an increasing trend), `:increasing` is returned; if all are negative (indicating a decreasing trend), `:decreasing` is returned; otherwise, `:stable` is returned to indicate that the temperature change isn't consistent across all days.","status":200,"tokens":[154,479],"elapsed":4.188207937,"_type":"aimessage"}]
