[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        average = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if average > max_temp\n            trend = :decreasing\n        elseif average < min_temp\n            trend = :increasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n        \n        return (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function works by first checking if the list of temperatures is empty. If it's empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf the list is not empty, it calculates the average temperature using the `mean` function from the `Statistics` package, and the maximum and minimum temperatures using the `maximum` and `minimum` functions. It then checks if the average temperature is greater than or less than the maximum or minimum temperature, respectively. If it's greater, the trend is set to `:decreasing`. If it's less, the trend is set to `:increasing`. Otherwise, the trend is set to `:stable`. \n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple with the calculated average, maximum, minimum, and trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,357],"elapsed":3.492203115,"_type":"aimessage"}]
