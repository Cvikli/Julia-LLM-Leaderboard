Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you might write this in Julia. \n\nFirst, ensure that the Statistics package is installed by running `]add Statistics` in your REPL.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n    minTemp = minimum(temps)\n    trend = ifelse(maxTemp > minTemp, :increasing, \n                   ifelse(maxTemp < minTemp, :decreasing, :stable))\n    \n    return (; average=average, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf the list isn't empty, it computes the average temperature, maximum and minimum temperatures, and determines the trend by comparing the maximum and minimum temperatures. It uses the `ifelse` function to return `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable` based on whether the maximum temperature is greater than, less than, or equal to the minimum temperature respectively. \n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple with the computed values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,318],"elapsed":3.06117902,"_type":"aimessage"}]
