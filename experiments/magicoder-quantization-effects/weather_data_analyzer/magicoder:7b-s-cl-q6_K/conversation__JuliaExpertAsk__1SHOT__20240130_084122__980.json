Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you could solve this problem in Julia. We use the `Statistics` standard library for statistical calculations:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics  # import necessary package\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)   # if list is empty, return named tuple with nothing\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)  # calculate average temperature\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)   # get the highest temperature\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)   # get the lowest temperature\n\n    if avg > max_temp  # check trend based on average and max temp\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif avg < min_temp\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable   # trend is stable when the average is equal to both the max and min temps\n    end\n    \n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)  # construct and return named tuple\nend\n```\nPlease note that this function assumes the list of daily temperature data is a numeric vector. If it's not, you might need to add type checking or conversion logic before proceeding with the statistical calculations.","status":200,"tokens":[184,308],"elapsed":3.062305465,"_type":"aimessage"}]
