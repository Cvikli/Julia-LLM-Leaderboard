Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could implement this in Julia. Note that we are assuming that the `temps` list will always contain at least one element:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics # Import the Statistics package for functions like mean, max, min etc.\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps) # Check if temps list is empty\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps) # Calculate average temperature\n    max_temp = maximum(temps) # Find the maximum temperature\n    min_temp = minimum(temps) # Find the minimum temperature\n    \n    if avg > max_temp # Check if trend is increasing\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif avg < min_temp # Check if trend is decreasing\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else \n        trend = :stable # Trend is stable if average equals max or min\n    end\n    \n    return (average = avg, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend=trend) # Return the results in a named tuple\nend\n```\nThis function first checks whether the `temps` list is empty. If it's not, it calculates the average temperature, maximum and minimum temperatures, and determines the trend based on these values. The results are then returned in a named tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,331],"elapsed":3.190694328,"_type":"aimessage"}]
