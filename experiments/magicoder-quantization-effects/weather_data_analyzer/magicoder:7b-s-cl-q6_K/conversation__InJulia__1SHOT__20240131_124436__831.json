If it's empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Then it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures from the list using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions respectively. It then determines the trend by checking if the first temperature is less than the last one (increasing), or if it's greater (decreasing). If both conditions are not met, it assumes that the trend is stable. Finally, it returns a named tuple with all these calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,352],"elapsed":3.378834565,"_type":"aimessage"}]
