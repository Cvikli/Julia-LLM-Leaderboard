X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers).

If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures using the built-in `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the Statistics package. It also determines the trend of temperature change by comparing the differences between consecutive days in the list. If all differences are positive, the trend is :increasing; if all are negative, it's :decreasing; otherwise, it's :stable. Finally, it returns a named tuple with these values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,400],"elapsed":3.945687074,"_type":"aimessage"}]
