Firstly, install the Statistics package if it isn't installed already using `Pkg.add(\"Statistics\")`. Now let's write the `weather_data_analyzer` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n    minTemp = minimum(temps)\n    diff = maxTemp - minTemp  # Difference between the maximum and minimum temperatures.\n    \n    if diff > 0\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif diff < 0\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (average=average, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThe function `weather_data_analyzer` takes an array of daily temperature data as input. If the array is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. Otherwise, it calculates and returns the average, maximum, minimum, and trend for the given array of temperatures.\n\nHere `trend = :increasing` means that the temperature data has been increasing over time, `trend = :decreasing` indicates that the temperature is decreasing and `trend = :stable` means that the temperature is not changing much or at all.","status":200,"tokens":[154,360],"elapsed":3.526662132,"_type":"aimessage"}]
