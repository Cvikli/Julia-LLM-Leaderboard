Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`).

If it is, then we return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nOtherwise, we compute the average temperature, maximum and minimum temperatures. We then compare these values to determine the trend of the data. \n\nIf the average is greater than both the max and min, or less than both, then the trend is `:increasing`. If it's less than both, but not more, then the trend is `:decreasing`. Otherwise, if none of these conditions are met, then the trend is `:stable`. \n\nWe return a named tuple with all these computed values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,375],"elapsed":3.619839114,"_type":"aimessage"}]
