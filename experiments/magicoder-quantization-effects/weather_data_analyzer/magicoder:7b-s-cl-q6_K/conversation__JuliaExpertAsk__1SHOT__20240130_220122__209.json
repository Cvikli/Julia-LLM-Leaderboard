The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia. Firstly, we need to install the Statistics package if it isn't already installed. You can do that using Pkg.add(\"Statistics\").\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if avg > max_temp\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif avg < min_temp\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. \n\nIf the list isn't empty, it calculates the average temperature using the mean() function from the Statistics package, and the maximum and minimum temperatures using the maximum() and minimum() functions respectively. It then checks if the average temperature is greater than or less than both the maximum and minimum temperature to determine the trend of the data (increasing, decreasing, or stable). \n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple with the calculated values for `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and `trend`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,358],"elapsed":3.417646593,"_type":"aimessage"}]
