Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem using Julia. Firstly, we need to install the Statistics package if it isn't already installed. You can do that by running `Pkg.add(\"Statistics\")` in your Julia console or REPL.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Check if list is empty\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    # Calculate the statistics\n    stats = (; \n        average=mean(temps), \n        max=maximum(temps), \n        min=minimum(temps)\n    )\n    \n    # Determine the trend\n    if first(temps) < last(temps)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif first(temps) > last(temps)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    # Return the results in a named tuple\n    return (; stats..., trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function works by first checking if the input list is empty. If it's not, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the Statistics package. It then determines the trend of the temperature data based on whether the first and last values are higher or lower than each other (increasing/decreasing) or if they're equal (stable). Finally, it returns a named tuple containing these statistics and the trend. If the input list is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,389],"elapsed":3.720822372,"_type":"aimessage"}]
