Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia using the Statistics package. \n\nFirstly, you need to install the Statistics package if it isn't already installed. You can do this by running the following command in your Julia terminal:\n```julia\nPkg.add(\"Statistics\")\n```\n\nThen you can define your function as follows:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        average = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if average > max_temp \n            trend = :decreasing\n        elseif average < min_temp \n            trend = :increasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n\n        return (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list of temperatures is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf the list isn't empty, it calculates the average temperature, maximum and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the Statistics package respectively. Then it checks if the average is greater than or less than both the max and min values to determine the trend (increasing, decreasing, or stable).\n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple with the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[154,373],"elapsed":3.585716503,"_type":"aimessage"}]
