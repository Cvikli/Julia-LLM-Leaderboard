Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution using Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if avg < min_temp\n            trend = :decreasing\n        elseif avg > max_temp\n            trend = :increasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n      \n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list of temperatures is empty. If it is, the function returns a named tuple with `nothing` values for all fields. \n\nIf the list isn't empty, the function calculates the average temperature using `mean`, the maximum and minimum temperatures using `maximum` and `minimum` functions respectively. Then, it checks if the average is less than the minimum or greater than the maximum, to determine the trend. \n\nIf the average is less than both the minimum and maximum (the trend decreases), it sets the trend field to `:decreasing`. If the average is greater than both the minimum and maximum (the trend increases), it sets the trend field to `:increasing`. Otherwise, if the average is between the maximum and minimum temperatures (trend stays stable), it sets the trend field to `:stable`.\n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple with the calculated values for `average`, `max`, `min` and `trend`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,401],"elapsed":3.9270441,"_type":"aimessage"}]
