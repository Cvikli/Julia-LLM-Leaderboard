Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you can solve this problem in Julia. This solution uses the Statistics package for computing the average and trend of the temperatures. The trend is determined by checking if the difference between consecutive elements in the sorted list is positive, negative or zero.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics: mean, extrema\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    n = length(temps)\n    \n    # Handle empty list case\n    if n == 0\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    # Compute the average temperature and extrema\n    avg_temp = mean(temps)\n    (min_temp, max_temp) = extrema(temps)\n    \n    # Determine the trend of the temperature data\n    sorted_temps = sort(temps)\n    diffs = diff([sorted_temps; [0]])  # append a zero to avoid error in last element\n    if all(diff .> 0, 1)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(diff .< 0, 1)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list of temperatures is empty. If it's empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it computes the average temperature and finds the minimum and maximum temperatures. It then determines the trend of the temperature data by checking if all differences between consecutive elements are positive, negative or zero. The result is returned as a named tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[184,408],"elapsed":3.93444451,"_type":"aimessage"}]
