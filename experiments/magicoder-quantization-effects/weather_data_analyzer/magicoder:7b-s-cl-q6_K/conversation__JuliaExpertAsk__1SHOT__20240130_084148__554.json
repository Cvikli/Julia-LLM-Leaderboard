Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can accomplish this by using Julia's built-in statistics package and named tuples. Here is how you might write it:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    maximum = maximum(temps)\n    minimum = minimum(temps)\n    trend_symbol = ifelse(maximum > avg, :increasing, \n                           ifelse(minimum < avg, :decreasing, :stable))\n    \n    return (average=avg, max=maximum, min=minimum, trend=trend_symbol)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks whether the `temps` list is empty. If it is, it creates a named tuple with all values set to nothing. \n\nIf not, it calculates the mean (average), maximum and minimum temperature using `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the Statistics package respectively, then determines the trend based on whether the highest or lowest temp is higher than average or not. The result is returned as a named tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,284],"elapsed":2.774839714,"_type":"aimessage"}]
