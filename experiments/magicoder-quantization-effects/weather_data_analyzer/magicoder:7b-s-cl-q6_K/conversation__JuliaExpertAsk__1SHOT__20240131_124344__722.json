Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can implement this in Julia. We will use the `Statistics` package for our statistical analyses:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n    minTemp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if average > maxTemp\n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif average < minTemp\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=average, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function works by first checking if the list of temperatures is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package. It then checks if the average temperature is greater than or less than the maximum or minimum temperature, respectively, to determine the trend of the data (increasing, decreasing, or stable). Finally, it returns a named tuple with these values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,310],"elapsed":2.977066163,"_type":"aimessage"}]
