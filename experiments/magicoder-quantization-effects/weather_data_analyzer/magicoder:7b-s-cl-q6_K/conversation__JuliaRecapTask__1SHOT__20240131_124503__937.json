[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers).

The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`).

This code uses the Statistics package which provides functions for calculating basic statistical properties of data. \n\n```julia\nusing Statistics,NamedTupleCore\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n        minTemp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        # Determine the trend.\n        if avg > maxTemp || avg < minTemp\n            trend = :decreasing\n        elseif avg == maxTemp && avg == minTemp\n            trend = :stable\n        else\n            trend = :increasing\n        end\n        \n        return (; average=avg, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this function, we first check if the list is empty. If it is, we return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf not, we calculate the average (`avg`), maximum (`maxTemp`) and minimum (`minTemp`) of the temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the Statistics package. \n\nWe then determine the trend by comparing these values to each other. If the average is greater than either the maximum or minimum, it's decreasing. If the average equals both the maximum and minimum, it's stable (not changing). Otherwise, it's increasing. \n\nFinally, we return a named tuple containing these statistical properties.","status":200,"tokens":[0,377],"elapsed":3.714600944,"_type":"aimessage"}]
