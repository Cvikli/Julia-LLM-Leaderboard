Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package).

If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem in Julia using the Statistics package. The function \"weather_data_analyzer\" will take as input a Vector of daily temperature data and it returns a NamedTuple containing the average, max, min temperatures, and trend. It also handles the case where the list is empty by returning NamedTuple with all values set to nothing.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if avg > max_temp \n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif avg < min_temp\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the array is empty. If it is, then it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. If not, then it calculates the mean and maximum/minimum temperatures using `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the Statistics package. It also determines the trend by comparing the average temperature to both the max and min temperature. \n\nThe trend is set as `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable` depending on if the average temperature is greater than the maximum, less than the minimum, or equal to all of them respectively. The results are returned in a named tuple which is created using the `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax.","status":200,"tokens":[0,419],"elapsed":4.160041491,"_type":"aimessage"}]
