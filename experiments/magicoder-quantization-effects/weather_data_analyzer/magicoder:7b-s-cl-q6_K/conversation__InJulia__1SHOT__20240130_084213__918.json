If it is, then it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. Otherwise, it computes the average, maximum and minimum temperatures using the mean() and extrema() functions from Statistics.jl package. It also checks the trend of temperature changes by comparing the differences between consecutive days' temperatures. If they are all positive, then the trend is :increasing; if they are all negative, then the trend is :decreasing; otherwise, it sets the trend to be :stable or unpredictable. The function returns a named tuple with these values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,513],"elapsed":5.018276592,"_type":"aimessage"}]
