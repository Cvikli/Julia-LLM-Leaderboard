[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem by using built-in functions of Julia. The solution will be:\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps) \n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    stats = (; average = mean(temps), \n              max = maximum(temps), \n              min = minimum(temps))\n    \n    trends = ifelse.(diff(temps) .> 0, :increasing, ifelse.(diff(temps) < 0, :decreasing, :stable))\n    trend = first(unique(trends))\n        \n    return (; stats..., trend=trend)\nend\n```\nIn this solution, we start by checking whether the input list `temps` is empty. If it is, we return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\nNext, we calculate the average, maximum and minimum temperatures using built-in functions from the `Statistics` package. We then calculate the temperature trend using an anonymous function that compares the differences of adjacent elements in the list `temps`, if this difference is positive it means the next day's temperature was higher so we set the trend to `:increasing`. If it was negative, we set the trend to `:decreasing` and if neither, then `:stable`.\n\nFinally, we return a named tuple containing all our calculated statistics and trends.","status":200,"tokens":[0,338],"elapsed":3.363916149,"_type":"aimessage"}]
