Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is an example of how you can solve this problem.\n\nFirstly, you need to install the Statistics package if it's not installed yet:\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"Statistics\")\n```\nThen you could use the following code:\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Handle case when list is empty\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n    minTemp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    trend = nothing\n    if length(temps) > 1 && temps[2] - temps[1] > 0\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif length(temps) > 1 && temps[2] - temps[1] < 0\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=avg, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nIn the above function, first we check if `temps` is empty. If it is, we return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Then, we calculate `avg`, `maxTemp`, and `minTemp` using the mean function from the Statistics package and minimum/maximum functions respectively.\n\nNext, we initialize `trend` as `nothing`. Then, if the length of `temps` is greater than 1, and the difference between consecutive temperatures is positive (meaning the temperatures are increasing), we set `trend` to `:increasing`. If the difference is negative, we set it to `:decreasing`, otherwise, we set it to `:stable`.\n\nFinally, we return a named tuple with all values computed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,435],"elapsed":4.297724189,"_type":"aimessage"}]
