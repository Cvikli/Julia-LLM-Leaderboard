Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"First, you need to install Statistics package if it isn't already installed. You can do this using Pkg.add(\"Statistics\") in Julia REPL. \n\nHere's how you might implement the `weather_data_analyzer` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        # Determine the trend\n        if avg > max_temp || avg < min_temp \n            return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=\"increasing\")\n        elseif avg < max_temp && avg > min_temp\n            return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=\"decreasing\")\n        else \n            return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=\"stable\")\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks whether the list of temperatures is empty. If it is, it constructs and returns a named tuple with `nothing` values for all keys. \n\nIf there are temperatures in the list, it calculates the average (`avg`), maximum (`max_temp`), and minimum (`min_temp`) of the temperatures using Julia's `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the Statistics package. It then determines the trend by comparing these calculated values to each other. If the average is greater than either the maximum or minimum, the function returns \"increasing\" as the trend. If it's less than both, the trend is \"decreasing\". If the average is between them, the trend is \"stable\". \n\nFinally, it constructs and returns a named tuple containing these calculated values and trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,474],"elapsed":4.721535221,"_type":"aimessage"}]
