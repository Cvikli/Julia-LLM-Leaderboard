Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I can help you write this Julia program. Here's an example of how you could implement it:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n    minTemp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if avg < temps[1]\n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif avg > temps[1]\n        trend = :increasing\n    else \n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=avg, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function works by first checking if the list of temperatures is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf the list isn't empty, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures and determines whether the temperature trend is increasing, decreasing or stable based on initial temperature value.\n\nYou can call this function with your daily temperature data like so:\n```julia\ntemps = [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]\nweather_data_analyzer(temps)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,330],"elapsed":3.2064345,"_type":"aimessage"}]
