[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia solution for this problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics  # Import the Statistics module\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        stats = mapreduce(x -> x, merge_with_identity, [maximum, minimum, mean])\n        trends = fill(:stable, length(temps))\n        for i in 2:length(temps)\n            if temps[i] > temps[i - 1]\n                trends[i] = :increasing\n            elseif temps[i] < temps[i - 1]\n                trends[i] = :decreasing\n            end\n        end\n        return (; average=stats.mean, max=stats.maximum, min=stats.minimum, trend=trends)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function works as follows:\n- If the length of `temps` is 0, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing.\n- Otherwise, it calculates the maximum (`maximum`), minimum (`minimum`), and average (`mean`) temperature using Julia's built-in Statistics module.\n- Then it creates an array of trends initialized as `:stable`. This array will store whether each temperature is increasing, decreasing or stable compared to the previous one.\n- It loops over the temperatures starting from the second one (to avoid out of range exceptions). For each temperature, it checks if it's higher or lower than its predecessor and sets the corresponding trend accordingly. \n- Finally, it constructs and returns a named tuple with `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and `trend`.\n\nPlease replace `{{instructions}}` with the instructions for this function in your specific use case.","status":200,"tokens":[0,425],"elapsed":4.241939435,"_type":"aimessage"}]
