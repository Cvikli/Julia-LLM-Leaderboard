Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you could write such a function in Julia. This function uses the Statistics package for statistical computations and NamedTuple for creating the final results object. \n\nFirstly, install the required packages by running these commands in your Julia terminal:\n\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"Statistics\")\nPkg.add(\"NamedTuples\")\n```\n\nHere's how you could write the function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\nimport NamedTuple\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if avg > first(temps)\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif avg < first(temps)\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n        \n        return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function works as follows: \n\n- It first checks if the list of daily temperatures is empty. If it's empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing.\n  \n- If there are temperatures in the list, it calculates the average (`avg`), maximum (`max_temp`) and minimum (`min_temp` temperatures) using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from Julia's Statistics package. \n\n- Then it checks whether the average temperature is greater than or less than the initial temperature in the list (to infer a trend).\n\n- Finally, it returns a named tuple with all the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,427],"elapsed":3.79560224,"_type":"aimessage"}]
