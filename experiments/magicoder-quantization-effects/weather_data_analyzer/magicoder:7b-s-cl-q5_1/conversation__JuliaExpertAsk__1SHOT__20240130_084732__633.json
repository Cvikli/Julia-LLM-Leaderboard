Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia. We will use the Statistics package to perform statistical analyses and NamedTuple type for constructing our result.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if avg > max_temp \n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif avg < min_temp\n        trend = :increasing\n    else \n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list of daily temperature data is empty. If it's not empty, it calculates `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` temperatures and determines a `trend` based on whether the average temperature is greater than the maximum or less than minimum temperature. The function then returns these statistics along with their calculated values in a named tuple. If the list of daily temperatures data is empty, the function returns a named tuple where all values are set to `nothing`.\n\nYou can test this function by running:\n```julia\ntemps = [20, 23, 18, 22, 24, 25]\nprint(weather_data_analyzer(temps))\n```\nThis will print a named tuple with the average, maximum, minimum and trend values for these temperatures.","status":200,"tokens":[0,394],"elapsed":3.569548155,"_type":"aimessage"}]
