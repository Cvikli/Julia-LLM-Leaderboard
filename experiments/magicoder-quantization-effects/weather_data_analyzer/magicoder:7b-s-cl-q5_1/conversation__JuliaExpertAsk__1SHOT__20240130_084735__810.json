Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you could write this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if all(t -> t > avg, temps)\n            return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:increasing)\n        elseif all(t -> t < avg, temps)\n            return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:decreasing)\n        else\n            return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:stable)\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes in a list of daily temperature data and calculates the average, maximum, minimum temperature. Then it checks if all temperatures are greater than the average or lesser than the average, which is used to determine the trend. If the list of temps is empty, then it returns a named tuple with everything set to `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,300],"elapsed":2.713113224,"_type":"aimessage"}]
