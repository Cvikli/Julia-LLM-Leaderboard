Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you could write that in Julia.\n\nFirst, let's assume we have installed the Statistics package by using the command: \n`using Statistics`\n\nAnd here is the code for our `weather_data_analyzer` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics: mean, max, min\n\nstruct WeatherDataAnalyzerResult <:NamedTuple\n    average::Union{Float64, Nothing}\n    max::Union{Float64, Nothing}\n    min::Union{Float64, Nothing}\n    trend::Union{Symbol, Nothing}\nend\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps) \n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n    minTemp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if avg > maxTemp \n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif avg < minTemp\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n        \n    WeatherDataAnalyzerResult(avg, maxTemp, minTemp, trend)\nend\n``` \n\nThe function `weather_data_analyzer` first checks if the list of daily temperature data `temps` is empty. If it is, then it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\nIf the list isn't empty, it calculates the average (mean), maximum and minimum temperatures from the given list. Then it checks if the average is larger than the maximum temperature or smaller than the minimum. It sets the trend accordingly: \n- If the average is larger than the maximum, then the trend is `:increasing`.\n- If the average is smaller than the minimum, then the trend is `:decreasing`.\n- Otherwise (mean equals to max or min), it's considered a `:stable` temperature. \n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple of these calculated statistics and trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,473],"elapsed":4.294083653,"_type":"aimessage"}]
