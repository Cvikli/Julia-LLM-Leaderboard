Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example Julia code that solves the problem you described. We'll use the `Statistics` package which is pre-installed in Julia and it provides functions for basic statistical operations:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n    minTemp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if maxTemp == minTemp\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif maxTemp > minTemp\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n    \n    return (average=avg,max=maxTemp,min=minTemp,trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of daily temperature data `temps` as input. If the list is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. Otherwise, it computes the average, maximum and minimum temperatures from the input list, then determines if the trend is increasing, decreasing or stable by comparing the maximum and minimum temperature values. The function finally returns a named tuple containing these computed values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,295],"elapsed":2.6721762,"_type":"aimessage"}]
