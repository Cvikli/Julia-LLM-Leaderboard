Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example implementation in Julia. For this solution we are going to use the `Statistics` and `NamedTupleCore` packages from Julia's standard library.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics, NamedTupleCore\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps) \n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if first(temps) < last(temps) \n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif first(temps) > last(temps) \n        trend = :decreasing\n    else \n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list is empty. If so, it returns a named tuple with `nothing` as the values for `average`, `max`, `min`, and `trend`. \n\nIf not, it calculates the average (`avg`), maximum (`max_temp`), minimum (`min_temp`) temperatures from the list. Then, it checks if the first temperature is less than the last one. If true, it sets `trend` as `:increasing`, else if false, it checks whether the first temperature is greater than the last one. If true, it sets `trend` as `:decreasing`, else it sets it as `:stable`. \n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple with calculated values for `average`, `max`, `min`, and `trend`.","status":200,"tokens":[184,401],"elapsed":3.664695967,"_type":"aimessage"}]
