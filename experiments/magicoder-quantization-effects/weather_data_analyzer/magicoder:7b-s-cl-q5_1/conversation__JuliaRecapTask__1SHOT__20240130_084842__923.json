[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`).

Here's how you could write the `weather_data_analyzer` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Check if temps list is empty or not\n    if isempty(temps) \n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else \n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        # Determine the trend based on the difference between the first and last temperatures in the list.\n        if temps[1] < temps[end] \n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif temps[1] > temps[end] \n            trend = :decreasing\n        else \n            trend = :stable\n        end\n        \n        return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this code, the function `weather_data_analyzer` takes a list of temperatures as an argument. If the list is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperature and determines the trend based on whether the first temperature in the list is less than or greater than the last one. It then constructs and returns a named tuple containing these calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,354],"elapsed":3.280439227,"_type":"aimessage"}]
