Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Firstly, you have to import the Statistics package in Julia. You can do this by adding the following line at the start of your code:\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n```\nNow we can write our function:\n\n```julia\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average = nothing, max = nothing, min=nothing, trend = nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if avg > max_temp && avg - max_temp > 10\n            return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=\"decreasing\")\n        elseif avg < min_temp && min_temp - avg > 10\n            return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=\"increasing\")\n        else\n            return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=\"stable\")\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function works by checking if the list of temperatures is empty. If it is, we return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \nIf the list isn't empty, we compute the average, max and min temperature using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the Statistics package. Then we check if the average temperature is greater than the max or less than the min by a margin of 10 degrees to determine the trend. If it's greater we return `:decreasing`, if it's smaller we return `:increasing`. If none of these conditions are met, we assume the trend to be stable and return `:stable`.\nThe results are then returned in a named tuple which is constructed using the `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax.","status":200,"tokens":[0,446],"elapsed":4.023459255,"_type":"aimessage"}]
