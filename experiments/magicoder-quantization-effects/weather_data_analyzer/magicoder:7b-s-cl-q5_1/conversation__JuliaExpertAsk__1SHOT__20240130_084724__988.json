Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple implementation of that in Julia. I'm assuming you already have the Statistics package installed and imported as \"Stat\" in your environment:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if isempty(unique(diff([0; temps; 0]))) # If all the differences are positive or negative, it's either increasing or decreasing\n        trend = temps[1] < temps[2] ? :increasing : :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. It then calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures from the given list using the respective functions from the Statistics package. \n\nFinally, it determines the trend of temperature changes by checking if all differences between consecutive elements are the same sign (i.e., positive or negative). If they are both positive or negative throughout the list, it's either increasing or decreasing. Otherwise, it's considered as \"stable\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,347],"elapsed":3.141172615,"_type":"aimessage"}]
