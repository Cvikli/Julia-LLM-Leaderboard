Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem using Julia's built-in statistical package `Statistics` and some basic data handling functionality. Here is a possible solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics # import necessary packages\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average_temp = mean(temps)  # compute the average temperature\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)   # find the highest temperature in the data set\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)   # find the lowest temperature in the data set\n    temp_trend = ifelse(max_temp > min_temp, :increasing, ifelse(max_temp < min_temp, :decreasing, :stable))  # check the trend of temperatures\n    \n    return (average = average_temp, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = temp_trend)  # return results in named tuple\nend\n```\nThis function works by first checking if the input list is empty. If it is, it returns a `NamedTuple` with all values set to `nothing`. If the list contains any elements, it computes the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package, respectively. It also checks the trend of temperature data by comparing the maximum and minimum temperatures. The function then returns a `NamedTuple` containing these computed values in response to the input data set.","status":200,"tokens":[0,361],"elapsed":2.929900103,"_type":"aimessage"}]
