[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia:\n\nFirstly, install the Statistics package if it isn't installed yet. You can do that by running `Pkg.add(\"Statistics\")` in your Julia console. \n\nHere is a possible solution for the task:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Check if temps list is empty\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    # Calculate the statistical data\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Determine the trend of the temperature data\n    if avg > max_temp\n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif avg < min_temp\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    # Return the results in a named tuple\n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nYou can call this function with your list of daily temperatures like so: `weather_data_analyzer([23, 25, 21, 24, 26])`. This will return a named tuple with the average temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and trend.\n\nIf you want to use special instructions, you can add them in the function like so:\n```julia\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps; special_instruction=\"default\")\n    # Your code here...\nend\n```\nThen call it with your list of daily temperatures and the special instruction as an additional argument: `weather_data_analyzer([23, 25, 21, 24, 26], \"special_instruction\")`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,449],"elapsed":3.675543347,"_type":"aimessage"}]
