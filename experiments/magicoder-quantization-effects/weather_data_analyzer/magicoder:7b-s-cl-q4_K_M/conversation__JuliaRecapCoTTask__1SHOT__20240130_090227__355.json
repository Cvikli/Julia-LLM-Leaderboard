[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem using Julia:\n\nFirstly, make sure you have the Statistics package installed in your environment. If it is not installed, use Pkg.add(\"Statistics\") to add it. \n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n```\n\nHere is the function `weather_data_analyzer`:\n\n```julia\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # handle case when temps array is empty\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end \n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n    minTemp = minimum(temps)\n    trend = isempty(filter(!=(avg), temps)) ? :stable : (first(temps)>avg ? :increasing : :decreasing)\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend) \nend \n```\nThis function takes an array of daily temperatures as its argument. If the temperature data is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. Otherwise, it computes the average and maximum/minimum temperatures using functions from the Statistics package and checks if the trend of the day-to-day changes in the temperature are increasing, decreasing or stable and returns these results as a named tuple.\n\nRemember to replace {{instructions}} with your specific instructions if any.","status":200,"tokens":[0,342],"elapsed":2.840632876,"_type":"aimessage"}]
