Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is the Julia solution for this problem. This program will create a function called `weather_data_analyzer` which takes in a list of temperatures and returns a named tuple containing the average, max, min temperatures, and trend based on the data provided. \n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (;average=nothing,max=nothing,min=nothing,trend=nothing)\n    else\n        average = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        trend = ifelse(max_temp > min_temp, :increasing, \n                      ifelse(min_temp > max_temp, :decreasing, :stable))\n        \n        return (;average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first checks whether the list of temperatures is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf there are some temperature data, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperature using `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package respectively. \n\nThen it determines the trend based on whether the maximum temperature is greater than or lesser than the minimum one. If maximum is greater, then the trend is `:increasing`. If minimum is greater, then the trend is `:decreasing`, otherwise, it's `:stable`. \n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple with all these calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,382],"elapsed":3.063560125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
