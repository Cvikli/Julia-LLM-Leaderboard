Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this task in Julia. You need to use the Statistics and DataFrames packages for these calculations:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics # To compute mean and extrema\nusing DataFrames  # To construct a data frame\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    df = DataFrame(Temperature = temps)\n    avg_temp = mean(df.Temperature)\n    max_temp = maximum(df.Temperature)\n    min_temp = minimum(df.Temperature)\n    \n    if df.Temperature[end] > df.Temperature[1]\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif df.Temperature[end] < df.Temperature[1]\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average = avg_temp, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty. If it is, a named tuple with `nothing` values for all keys is returned. Otherwise, it creates a data frame from the temperatures and computes the average, maximum, minimum temperature using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions respectively. The trend is calculated based on whether the highest temperature is greater than the lowest one or vice versa. Finally, the function returns a named tuple with these computed values.\n\nThis function assumes that the input list is a list of numbers (temperatures). If it could be any type of data, you would need to add checks and adjustments for handling that accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,413],"elapsed":3.404195166,"_type":"aimessage"}]
