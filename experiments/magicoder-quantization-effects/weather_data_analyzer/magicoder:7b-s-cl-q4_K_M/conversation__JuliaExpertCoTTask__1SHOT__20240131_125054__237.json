Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here's an example of how you could solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    if max_temp == avg && min_temp == avg\n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:stable)\n    elseif max_temp > avg && min_temp < avg\n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:increasing)\n    else\n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:decreasing)\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this function, we first check if the list is empty. If it is, we return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf the list is not empty, we calculate the average (`avg`), maximum (`max_temp`) and minimum (`min_temp`) temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package.\n\nThen, based on these values, we determine the trend of temperature changes. If all temperatures are equal (indicating a stable climate), the trend is `:stable`. If the maximum temperature is greater than the average and the minimum temperature is lesser than the average (indicating an increasing trend), the trend is `:increasing`. Otherwise, if any of these conditions are not met, the trend is `:decreasing`.\n\nFinally, we return a named tuple containing all calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,433],"elapsed":3.522604079,"_type":"aimessage"}]
