Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia solution using the `Statistics` package:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics # Import the statistics module \n\n# Define the function\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    n = length(temps)\n    \n    # Handle empty list case\n    if n == 0\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps) # Average temperature\n    max_temp = maximum(temps) # Maximum temperature\n    min_temp = minimum(temps) # Minimum temperature\n    trend = nothing\n    \n    # Check if temperatures are increasing, decreasing or stable\n    if all(temps[i+1] > temps[i] for i in 1:n-1)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(temps[i+1] < temps[i] for i in 1:n-1)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend) # Return results\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list is empty. If it's empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package respectively. It then checks if the temperatures are increasing, decreasing or stable by comparing each pair of consecutive elements. The result is returned as a named tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[184,381],"elapsed":3.118080805,"_type":"aimessage"}]
