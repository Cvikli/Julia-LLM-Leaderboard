Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you can solve this problem in Julia using the `Statistics` package. This code assumes that your temperatures are stored as a vector of numbers:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    trend = ifelse(avg > max_temp, :decreasing, ifelse(avg < min_temp, :increasing, :stable))\n    \n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first checking whether the list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf the list isn't empty, it calculates the average temperature using the `mean` function from the `Statistics` package. It then finds the maximum and minimum temperatures using the `maximum` and `minimum` functions respectively. Finally, it determines whether the trend is increasing, decreasing or stable by comparing the average temperature to the maximum and minimum temperatures. The `ifelse` function is used for this comparison and returns `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable` as appropriate. \n\nThe results are then returned in a named tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,352],"elapsed":2.810800196,"_type":"aimessage"}]
