Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem using Julia programming language.\n\nFirstly, you need to install the Statistics package if it isn't installed yet. You can do so by running `]add Statistics` in your Julia REPL.\n\nHere is a possible solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # If temps list is empty, return named tuple with nothing values\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    trend = ifelse(max_temp > min_temp, :increasing, \n                   (avg - min_temp) > (max_temp - avg) ? :decreasing : :stable)\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list of temps is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. \n\nIf the list isn't empty, it calculates the average temperature, maximum and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the Statistics package respectively. It then determines the trend based on whether the max temp is greater than min temp or not. If it is, the trend is set to `:increasing`. If it isn't, the trend is determined by comparing the average temperature with the difference between the max and min temperatures. If the average temperature is less than the difference, then the trend is `:decreasing`, otherwise it is `:stable`.\n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple containing the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,423],"elapsed":3.348574956,"_type":"aimessage"}]
