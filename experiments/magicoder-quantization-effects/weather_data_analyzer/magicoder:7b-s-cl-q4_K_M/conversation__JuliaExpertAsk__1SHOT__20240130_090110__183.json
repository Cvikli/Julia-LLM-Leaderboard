Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might solve this problem in Julia. Note that for this solution I'm assuming that we only have temperature data in the range -50 to 50 since temperatures tend to be fairly small and positive or negative.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nstruct WeatherDataAnalysisResult{T} <: NamedTuple\n    average::T\n    max_temp::T\n    min_temp::T\n    trend::Symbol\nend\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return WeatherDataAnalysisResult{Union{Float64, Nothing}}(nothing, nothing, nothing, :stable)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if avg > 0 && max_temp == 50 && min_temp == -50\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif avg < 0 && max_temp == -50 && min_temp == 50\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return WeatherDataAnalysisResult(avg, max_temp, min_temp, trend)\nend\n```\n\nThe function `weather_data_analyzer` takes in a list of daily temperatures and calculates the average, maximum, minimum, and trend. The function returns a named tuple that contains these calculated values. If the list is empty, it constructs a named tuple with all its fields set to `nothing`.\n\nThe trend is determined based on a simple heuristic that assumes increasing temperatures for high max_temp and low min_temp, and decreasing temperatures for high min_temp and low max_temp. This is just an example and real-world data might require more complex logic to determine the trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,434],"elapsed":3.529605498,"_type":"aimessage"}]
