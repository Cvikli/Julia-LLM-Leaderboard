Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could implement this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if avg > max_temp || avg < min_temp\n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif avg == max_temp && avg == min_temp\n        trend = :stable\n    else\n        trend = :increasing\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average (`mean`), maximum (`maximum`), and minimum temperature of the data using functions from the `Statistics` package. It then determines the trend based on whether the average temperature is greater than or less than either the maximum or minimum temperature.\n\nYou can test this function with your example like so:\n\n```julia\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,336],"elapsed":2.683032054,"_type":"aimessage"}]
