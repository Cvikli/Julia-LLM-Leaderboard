Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia. First, import the `Statistics` package, which provides methods for statistical analysis like average, max, min and others. Then define your function using the `namedtuple` function from the `Parameters` standard library to create a named tuple. The function will return a new named tuple when called, so you can use dot notation to access its fields.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics: mean, extrema\nusing Parameters: @with_kw\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        maximum, minimum = extrema(temps)\n        \n        trend = nothing\n        if minimum < maximum\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif minimum > maximum\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n        \n        return (; average=avg, max=maximum, min=minimum, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- `mean` is a function in the `Statistics` package that calculates the mean of an array.\n- `extrema` also from `Statistics` finds the minimum and maximum value in an iterable.\n- The `@with_kw` macro from `Parameters` makes it easier to create named tuples with keyword arguments.\n- We first check if the list is empty, and return a named tuple filled with `nothing` if true. If not, we compute the average, max/min temperatures using `mean` and `extrema`, respectively. We then determine the trend based on whether the minimum temperature is less than the maximum, greater than the maximum or neither of these cases (stable). Finally, we construct and return a named tuple with all computed values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,433],"elapsed":3.577341049,"_type":"aimessage"}]
