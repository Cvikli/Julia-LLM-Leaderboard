Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use Julia's built-in statistical functions from the Statistics package to perform these calculations. Here is how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    if avg > first(temps)\n        trend = :increasing  # warming up trend\n    elseif avg < first(temps)\n        trend = :decreasing  # cooling down trend\n    else \n        trend = :stable      # stable temperature trend\n    end\n\n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty. If it's not, the function calculates `average`, `max` and `min` using functions from the Statistics package, then determines the `trend` based on the average temperature compared to the initial temperature in the list.","status":200,"tokens":[0,283],"elapsed":2.288882121,"_type":"aimessage"}]
