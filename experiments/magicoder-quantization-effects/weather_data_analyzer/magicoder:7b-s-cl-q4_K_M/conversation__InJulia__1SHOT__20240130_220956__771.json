This solution uses the Statistics package for calculating mean, maximum and minimum temperatures, and Base package for checking if the list of temperatures is empty or not.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Check if the list is empty\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Determine the trend\n    if average > max_temp || average < min_temp\n        return (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:decreasing)\n    elseif average == max_temp && average == min_temp\n        return (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:stable)\n    else\n        return (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:increasing)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list of temperatures is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf the list is not empty, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures using functions from the Statistics package. It then determines the trend based on whether the average temperature is greater than or less than either of the max and min temperatures, or if they are equal to each other. \n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple containing these calculated values along with the trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,392],"elapsed":3.105495465,"_type":"aimessage"}]
