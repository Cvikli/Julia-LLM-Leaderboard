[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers).

If the list is empty, it will return a NamedTuple with all fields set to nothing. \n\nThe trend is determined by comparing the first temperature in the list (assumed to be representative of the entire list) with the average temperature. If the average is less than the initial temperature, the function will return `:decreasing`, if it's greater - `:increasing`, and if they are equal - `:stable`. \n\nThis solution assumes that the given list represents a single day's temperature data. If multiple days of data are provided, the first temperature should be representative of all of them for this approach to work properly.","status":200,"tokens":[454,410],"elapsed":3.438969375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
