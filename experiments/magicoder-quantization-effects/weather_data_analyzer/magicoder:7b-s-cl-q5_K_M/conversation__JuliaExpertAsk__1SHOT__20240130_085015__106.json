Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)  # If the list is empty, return a named tuple with nothing\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    stats = (;\n        average = mean(temps),\n        max     = maximum(temps),\n        min     = minimum(temps),\n        trend   = ifelse(maximum(temps) > minimum(temps), :increasing, \n                          ifelse(minimum(temps) > maximum(temps), :decreasing, :stable))\n    )\n    \n    return stats\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks whether the input list is empty. If it's not, it calculates the average, max and min of the temperatures and determines the trend based on the difference between maximum and minimum (increasing if positive, decreasing if negative). It constructs a named tuple with these statistics and returns it.\n\nHere `ifelse` is used to conditionally assign values to different keys in the returned named tuple, similar to ternary operator in other languages.\n  \nPlease remember that this function assumes that the input list of temperatures is non-empty and contains only numeric data. If these assumptions may not hold for your use case, you would need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,326],"elapsed":2.902864867,"_type":"aimessage"}]
