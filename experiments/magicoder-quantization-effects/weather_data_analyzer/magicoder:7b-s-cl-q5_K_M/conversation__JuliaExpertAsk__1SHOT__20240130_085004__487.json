Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia. Firstly, install the Statistics package using Pkg.add(\"Statistics\"). After that, here's the function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics \n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps) \n    if isempty(temps) \n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else \n        avg = mean(temps) \n        max_temp = maximum(temps) \n        min_temp = minimum(temps) \n        \n        if length(unique(diff([max_temp, min_temp]))) == 1 \n            trend = :stable  \n        elseif avg > max_temp \n            trend = :increasing \n        else \n            trend = :decreasing\n        end\n        \n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function works as follows: if the list of temps is empty it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. If the list has elements, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures using `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the Statistics package, then checks the trend based on the difference between max temperature and min temperature (if they are different it's increasing or decreasing), if they're equal it's stable.","status":200,"tokens":[184,334],"elapsed":2.979967582,"_type":"aimessage"}]
