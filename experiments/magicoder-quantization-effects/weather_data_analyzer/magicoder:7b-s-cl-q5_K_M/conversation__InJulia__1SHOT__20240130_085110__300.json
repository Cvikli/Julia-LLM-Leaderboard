Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package).

This function will use the `Statistics` package which is included in Julia's standard library. \n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n    minTemp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if length(unique(diff([0; temps]))) == 1\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif diff([0; temps])[2] > 0\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n    \n    return (average=avg, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the `temps` list is empty. If it is, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf the `temps` list is not empty, then it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperature by using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package respectively. It also determines the trend of the temperatures by checking the differences between consecutive elements in the list. \n\nIf all consecutive differences are greater than zero (i.e., the temperature is increasing), then it sets the trend as `:increasing`. If there's any difference that is less than zero (i.e., the temperature is decreasing), then it sets the trend as `:decreasing`. If none of these conditions are met, then the trend is considered to be `:stable` (i.e., the temperature is not changing).\n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple containing the average, maximum and minimum temperatures along with the determined trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,453],"elapsed":4.025909906,"_type":"aimessage"}]
