Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can define your `weather_data_analyzer` function in Julia programming language using the `Statistics` package. \n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Check if list is empty\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    # Perform statistical analyses\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Determine the temperature trend\n    if max_temp > min_temp\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif max_temp < min_temp\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else \n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    # Return results in named tuple\n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the `temps` list is empty. If it's true, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Then, it calculates the average (`avg`), maximum (`max`), and minimum (`min`) temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package. \n\nNext, it determines the temperature trend based on the maximum and minimum temperatures. If the maximum is greater than the minimum, it's an increasing trend. If the maximum is lesser than the minimum, it's a decreasing trend. Otherwise, it's a stable trend.\n\nFinally, it constructs and returns a named tuple containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and the `trend`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,419],"elapsed":3.709816691,"_type":"aimessage"}]
