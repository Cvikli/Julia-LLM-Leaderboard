Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia solution for your problem. The `Statistics` package is used here for its functionality to compute the mean of the list of temperatures:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if avg > max_temp\n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif avg < min_temp\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list of temperatures is empty. If it's empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \nIf the list is not empty, it computes the average temperature by using Julia's built-in `mean` function from the `Statistics` package, and finds the maximum and minimum temperatures with `maximum` and `minimum` functions respectively.\nThen it checks if the average is greater than the maximum or lesser than the minimum to determine a trend and assigns a value to the key \"trend\". \nFinally, it returns a named tuple containing the computed values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,345],"elapsed":3.064922448,"_type":"aimessage"}]
