Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you would write that function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    \n    if avg > first(temps) && last(temps) > avg\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif avg < first(temps) && last(temps) < avg\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list `temps` is empty.

The function then checks if the first and last temperatures are higher or lower than the average to determine the trend: if the average temperature is greater than both the first and last temperatures, the trend is `:increasing`; if it's less than both, the trend is `:decreasing`; otherwise, the trend is `:stable`. The function then returns a named tuple containing these calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[323,358],"elapsed":4.872392063,"_type":"aimessage"}]
