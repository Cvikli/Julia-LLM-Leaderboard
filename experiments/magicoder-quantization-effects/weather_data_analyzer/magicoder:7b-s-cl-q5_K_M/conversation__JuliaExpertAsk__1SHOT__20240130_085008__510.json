Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem by using the following code. This function will calculate the average, maximum and minimum temperatures from the input data, then it uses the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list to identify whether the temperature trend is increasing, decreasing or stable. If the list of temperatures is empty, all values are set to `nothing`.\n\nHere is a Julia solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # If list is empty return named tuple with nothing\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    sorted_temp = sort(temps) \n\n    # Calculate average\n    avg_temp = mean(sorted_temp)\n\n    # Calculate maximum and minimum temperatures\n    max_temp = maximum(sorted_temp)\n    min_temp = minimum(sorted_temp)\n\n    # Determine the trend of temperature\n    temp_diff = diff(sorted_temp)\n\n    if all(x -> x > 0, temp_diff)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(x -> x < 0, temp_diff)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=avg_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list of temperatures is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf the list is not empty, it sorts the list in ascending order and calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures using functions from the `Statistics` package. It then uses the `diff()` function to find the differences between consecutive elements of the sorted temperature list. If all the differences are positive, this indicates that the temperature is increasing; if all the differences are negative it indicates that the temperature is decreasing; otherwise, the trend is considered to be stable. \n\nFinally, it constructs and returns a named tuple containing these values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,489],"elapsed":4.338513681,"_type":"aimessage"}]
