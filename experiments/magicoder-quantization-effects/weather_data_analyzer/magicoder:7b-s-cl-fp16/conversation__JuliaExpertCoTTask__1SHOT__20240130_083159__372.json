Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this task using Julia. Please note that for the solution, we will be using the `Statistics` and `NamedTuple` packages which need to be installed first:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\nimport NamedTuple\n\n# Define a function to analyze weather data\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    if average > first(temps)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif average < last(temps)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the `temps` array is empty. If it's empty, a named tuple with all values set to `nothing` is returned. \n\nIf the array is not empty, the average temperature, maximum temperature and minimum temperature are calculated using `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions respectively from the `Statistics` package. The trend of temperature data is determined by comparing the first value (minimum) to the average temperature, and last value (maximum) to the average temperature. If the average is greater than both these values, then the trend is set as `:increasing`. If it's lesser than both these values, the trend is set as `:decreasing`, else it's set as `:stable`.\n\nFinally, a named tuple with the computed statistics and trend is returned. \n\nYou can use this function to analyze weather data like this:\n```julia\nprintln(weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22]))\n```\nThis will print a named tuple containing the average temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature and trend of given list of daily temperatures.","status":200,"tokens":[0,488],"elapsed":8.751704199,"_type":"aimessage"}]
