Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can write such a function in Julia. The function will use the Statistics package to calculate the mean (average), maximum and minimum temperatures. It also checks for monotonicity of the data, returning `:increasing`, `:decreasing` or `:stable` based on this check.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if isempty(unique(diff(sort(temps)))) || all(isnan, temps)\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif first(diff(sort(temps))) > 0\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n    \n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list is empty. If it's empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf the list is not empty, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the Statistics package. \n\nThen, it checks for monotonicity of the data by sorting the data and checking if all adjacent differences are equal (indicating a stable trend) or if they're all positive (indicating an increasing trend) or negative (indicating a decreasing trend). The result is stored in `trend`.\n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple with the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,414],"elapsed":7.188433453,"_type":"aimessage"}]
