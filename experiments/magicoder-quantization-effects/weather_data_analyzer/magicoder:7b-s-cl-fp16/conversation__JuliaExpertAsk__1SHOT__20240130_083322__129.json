Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you might implement this in Julia. This example uses the Statistics package for calculating statistics and DifferentialEquations package for identifying trends (note that it only considers linear trends). \n\n```julia\nusing Statistics: mean, extrema\nusing DifferentialEquations: solve\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing) \n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    (min,max) = extrema(temps)\n    sol = solve((t)->1/2*t^2-max/avg*(t-1),0.5,1.5)\n    if sol.u[end] > 0 \n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif sol.u[end] < 0 \n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=max, min=min, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty. If it's not, then calculates the mean and range of the data to obtain the maximum (`max`), minimum (`min`) and average (`average`). \n\nIt uses a differential equation solver to identify the trend in the temperature data. This assumes that temperature changes are linear over a wide enough time period (i.e., between `0.5` and `1.5` days). If the solution indicates an increase, the function returns `:increasing`; if it indicates a decrease, the function returns `:decreasing`; if neither, then it returns `:stable`. \n\nIt finally constructs and returns a named tuple containing these calculated values. If the list is empty, all values are set to `nothing` in the returned named tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,433],"elapsed":7.596629208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
