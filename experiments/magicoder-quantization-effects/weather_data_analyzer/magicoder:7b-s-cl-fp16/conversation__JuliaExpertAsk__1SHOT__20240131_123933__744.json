Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia. We will use the `Statistics` package for getting statistical properties of data and `NamedTuple` for constructing a response:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)  # check if list is empty\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if avg > max_temp\n            trend = :decreasing\n        elseif avg < min_temp\n            trend = :increasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n    \n        return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list is empty. If it's empty, it returns a named tuple with `nothing` for all values. Otherwise, it calculates the average and maximum/minimum temperatures using the `mean` and `extrema` functions from the `Statistics` package, respectively. It then determines the trend based on whether the average temperature is greater than or less than the maximum/minimum temperature (increasing/decreasing), and finally constructs a named tuple with these values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,330],"elapsed":5.721244242,"_type":"aimessage"}]
