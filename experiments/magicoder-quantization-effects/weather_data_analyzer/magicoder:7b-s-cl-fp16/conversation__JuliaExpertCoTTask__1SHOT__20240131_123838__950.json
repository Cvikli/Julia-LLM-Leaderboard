Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        trend = ifelse(max_temp > avg, :increasing, \n                       (min_temp < avg) ? :decreasing : :stable)\n\n        return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list is empty. If it's empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures, then determines the trend based on these statistics. The trend is determined by comparing the maximum temperature to the average, and if it's greater than average, it's considered increasing; if it's less than average, it's considered decreasing; otherwise, it's stable.\n\nYou can test this function using:\n```julia\nprintln(weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22]))\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,327],"elapsed":5.704979605,"_type":"aimessage"}]
