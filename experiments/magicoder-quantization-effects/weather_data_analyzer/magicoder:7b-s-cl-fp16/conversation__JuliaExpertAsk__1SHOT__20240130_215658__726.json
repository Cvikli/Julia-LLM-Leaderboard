Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia. Firstly, install Statistics package if it isn't installed yet using Pkg.add(\"Statistics\").\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        # Determine the trend\n        if avg > max_temp\n            trend = :decreasing\n        elseif avg < min_temp\n            trend = :increasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n\n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nYou can test the function with:\n\n```julia\ntemps1 = [23.5, 24.2, 23.7, 24.9, 25.0]\nprint(weather_data_analyzer(temps1))\n\ntemps2 = []\nprint(weather_data_analyzer(temps2))\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list is empty or not. If it's empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures using the mean, maximum and minimum functions from Statistics package respectively. Then, it determines the trend based on whether the average temperature is higher than the maximum or lower than the minimum. Finally, it returns a named tuple with these values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,395],"elapsed":6.848981139,"_type":"aimessage"}]
