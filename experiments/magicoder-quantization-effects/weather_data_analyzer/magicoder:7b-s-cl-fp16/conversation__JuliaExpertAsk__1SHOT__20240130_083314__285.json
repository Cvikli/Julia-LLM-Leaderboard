The function `weather_data_analyzer` will return these results in a named tuple (constructed using `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax). Here's how you could implement this:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    diff = max_temp - min_temp\n    \n    if diff > 0\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif diff < 0\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function takes a list of temperatures `temps` as its argument. If the list is empty, it will return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average temperature, maximum and minimum temperatures, and then determines whether the temperature trend is increasing, decreasing or stable by comparing the maximum and minimum temperatures.","status":200,"tokens":[0,322],"elapsed":5.645290855,"_type":"aimessage"}]
