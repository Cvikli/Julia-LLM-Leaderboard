Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia solution for your problem. This solution uses the Statistics package to calculate the average and trend of the data. The trend is calculated by looking at the differences between successive temperature readings in the list. If they are always increasing, then it is `:increasing`. If they are always decreasing, then it is `:decreasing`. Otherwise, it's `:stable`.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (; average = nothing, max = nothing, min=nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    diffs = diff([temps; 0]) # Append a 0 to ensure we have the same length as temps for the diff operation\n    if all(diff .> 0, diff)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(diff .< 0, diff)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\ntemps = [23.0, 24.1, 25.2, 24.3, 26.0]\nprint(weather_data_analyzer(temps))\n# Output: NamedTuple{(:average, :max, :min, :trend)}\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,382],"elapsed":6.648912876,"_type":"aimessage"}]
