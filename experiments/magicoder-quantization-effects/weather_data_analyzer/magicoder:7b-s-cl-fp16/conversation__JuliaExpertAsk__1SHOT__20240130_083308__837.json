Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of your requirements in Julia.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Handle empty data scenario\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    if avg < temps[1]\n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif avg > temps[end]\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list of temps is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. \n\nIf there are elements in `temps`, it calculates the average (`avg`), maximum (`max_temp`), and minimum (`min_temp`) temperatures by using the `mean` function from the `Statistics` package for average, `maximum` function for maximum temperature and `minimum` function for minimum temperature.\n\nThen it checks if the trend of the data is increasing, decreasing or stable. This is done by comparing the average with the first (`temps[1]`) and last (`temps[end]`) elements of the list. \n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple with these computed values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,356],"elapsed":6.257953405,"_type":"aimessage"}]
