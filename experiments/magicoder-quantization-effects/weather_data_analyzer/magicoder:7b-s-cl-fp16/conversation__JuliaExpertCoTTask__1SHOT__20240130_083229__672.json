Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you might solve this problem in Julia:\n\nFirstly, we import the required package `Statistics`.\nThen define the function `weather_data_analyzer` as follows:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n        temp_trend = ifelse(avg > max_temp, :increasing, \n                         ifelse(avg < min_temp, :decreasing, :stable))\n\n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=temp_trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function works by first checking if the input list `temps` is empty. If it is, we return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf `temps` is not empty, we calculate the average, maximum and minimum temperature from the data using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package. \n\nNext we determine the trend of the temperature data based on whether the average temperature is greater than the maximum temperature or lesser than the minimum. If it's greater, we return `:increasing`. If it's lesser, we return `:decreasing`. Otherwise, we return `:stable`. \n\nFinally, we construct and return a named tuple with our calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,374],"elapsed":6.626592672,"_type":"aimessage"}]
