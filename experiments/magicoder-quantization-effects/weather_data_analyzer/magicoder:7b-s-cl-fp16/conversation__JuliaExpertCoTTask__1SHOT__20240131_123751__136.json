Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's a solution using Julia programming language:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n    minTemp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if average < temps[1]\n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif average > temps[1]\n        trend = :increasing\n    else \n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=average, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks whether the input list `temps` is empty. If it's empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it computes the average temperature (`mean(temps)`), the maximum and minimum temperatures (`maximum(temps)`, `minimum(temps)`) and determines whether the temperatures are generally increasing, decreasing or stable relative to the first day's temperature. The trend is determined by comparing the average with the first temperature in the list. If the average is less than the first temperature, it's considered a decrease, if greater - an increase, otherwise - stability.\n\nYou can test this function using your example like so:\n```julia\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,363],"elapsed":6.351439627,"_type":"aimessage"}]
