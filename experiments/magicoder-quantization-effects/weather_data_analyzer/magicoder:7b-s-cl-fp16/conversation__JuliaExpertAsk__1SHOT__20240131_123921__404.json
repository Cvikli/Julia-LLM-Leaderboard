Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could implement this in Julia. This code uses the Statistics package for performing statistical operations:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        # Determine the trend based on whether the average is greater than or less than the maximum and minimum temperatures.\n        if avg > max_temp && avg > min_temp\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif avg < max_temp && avg < min_temp\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n        \n        return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the `temps` list is empty. If it's empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. Otherwise, it calculates the average (`avg`), maximum (`max_temp`), and minimum (`min_temp`) temperatures from the `temps` list. It then determines the `trend`, which is `:increasing` if the average temperature is greater than both the maximum and minimum temperatures, `:decreasing` if the average temperature is lesser than both the maximum and minimum temperatures, and `:stable` otherwise. Finally, it returns a named tuple with these calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,374],"elapsed":6.496397884,"_type":"aimessage"}]
