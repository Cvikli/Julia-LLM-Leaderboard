Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you could implement this in Julia. First, make sure that the Statistics package is installed on your machine by running: \n```julia\nPkg.add(\"Statistics\")\n```\nThen use the following code as a starting point for your function:\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if length(unique(diff(temps))) == 1 && diff(temps)[1] > 0\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif length(unique(diff(temps))) == 1 && diff(temps)[1] < 0\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n        \n        return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list is empty and returns a named tuple with `nothing` values for all keys if so. If not, it calculates the average, maximum, minimum, and trend of the temperature data. The trend is determined by checking whether the temperatures are increasing or decreasing continuously over time, or remain stable.","status":200,"tokens":[0,332],"elapsed":3.726353045,"_type":"aimessage"}]
