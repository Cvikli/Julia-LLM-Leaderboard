Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example solution in Julia.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    trend = ifelse(max_temp == min_temp, :stable, \n                   ifelse(max_temp > min_temp, :increasing, :decreasing))\n\n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThe function first checks if the list of daily temperatures is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf the list isn't empty, it calculates the average (`avg`), maximum (`max_temp`), and minimum (`min_temp`) temperature. Then it determines the trend based on the difference between the max and min temperatures. If they are equal, the trend is set to `:stable`. If the max is greater than the min, the trend is set to `:increasing`, otherwise, it's `:decreasing`. Finally, the function constructs and returns a named tuple with these values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,317],"elapsed":3.584856791,"_type":"aimessage"}]
