Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can approach this problem in Julia. We will use Statistics and DataFrames packages for our solution.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics, DataFrames\n\n# Define your function\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps) \n    # If the list is empty return a named tuple with nothing values\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    df = DataFrame(temp = temps)\n    \n    # Compute average, max and min temperatures\n    avg_temp = mean(df.temp)\n    max_temp = maximum(df.temp)\n    min_temp = minimum(df.temp)\n    \n    # Determine the trend of the temperature data\n    if avg_temp < first(temps) \n        return (average=avg_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:decreasing)\n    elseif avg_temp > last(temps)\n        return (average=avg_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:increasing)\n    else \n        return (average=avg_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:stable)\n    end\n    \nend\n```\nThis function first checks whether the list is empty. If it's true then it returns a named tuple with `nothing` values for average, maximum and minimum temperature and stable as trend. \n\nIf the list isn't empty, it converts the list to a DataFrame and calculates the mean, maximum and minimum temperatures. It uses the first value in the original list (temps) to determine if the trend is increasing or decreasing. If average temperature is less than the first number then trend is set as `:decreasing`, if it's more than last element then `:increasing` else it's `:stable`.\n\nIt finally returns a named tuple with all these calculated values.\n\nNote: The `first()` and `last()` functions are used to get the first and last elements of the original list, respectively.","status":200,"tokens":[0,495],"elapsed":5.711671549,"_type":"aimessage"}]
