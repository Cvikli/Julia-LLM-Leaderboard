Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can write this in Julia.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics # Import the statistics package for calculating mean and extrema\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Create an empty named tuple with nothing values\n    stats = (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    \n    if isempty(temps)\n        return stats\n    end\n    \n    average_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Determine the trend based on temperature differences\n    diffs = abs.(diff(temps))\n    if all(d -> d > 0, diffs)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(d -> d < 0, diffs)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=average_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend) # Return the named tuple with new values\nend\n```\nIn this function, `isempty(temps)` checks if the list is empty. If it is, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the mean and extrema of the temperatures using `mean` and `extrema` functions from Statistics package, respectively. The trend is then determined based on whether the difference between consecutive temperatures are always positive or negative.\n\nThis function should work with any list of numbers (temperature data).","status":200,"tokens":[0,365],"elapsed":4.127262452,"_type":"aimessage"}]
