Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you can solve this problem in Julia. You need to make sure Statistics package is imported:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics \n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n    minTemp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # calculate the difference between the first and last element in the list \n    diff = temps[end] - temps[1]\n    \n    if diff > 0 \n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif diff < 0 \n        trend = :decreasing\n    else \n        trend = :stable\n    end \n      \n    return (; average=average, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list of temperatures is empty. If it's empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` for the data and determines the `trend` based on the difference between the first and last elements in the list.\nPlease note that this function does not handle possible `NaN`s in your temperature data. If you have any, you might want to consider handling them appropriately (for example: by removing them before calling this function). \n\nYou can use it like so:\n```julia\ntemps = [23, 25, 24, 22, 23, 25, 23] # list of daily temperature data\nweather_data_analyzer(temps)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,410],"elapsed":4.623999687,"_type":"aimessage"}]
