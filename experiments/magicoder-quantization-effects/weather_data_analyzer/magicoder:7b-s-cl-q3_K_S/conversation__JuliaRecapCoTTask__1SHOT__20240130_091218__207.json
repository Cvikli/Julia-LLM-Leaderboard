[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you might define the function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n  if isempty(temps)\n    return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n  else\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    trend_value = ifelse(avg - max_temp > avg - min_temp, :increasing, \n                        (avg - min_temp < avg - max_temp ? :decreasing : :stable))\n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend_value)\n  end\nend\n```\nThis function works by first checking if the list of temperatures is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\nOtherwise, it calculates the average (`avg`), maximum (`max_temp`) and minimum (`min_temp`) temperature using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package. \n\nThen, it determines the trend based on how much the average deviates from each of the extremes (`max_temp` or `min_temp`). If the average is higher than both extremes, the trend is `:increasing`. If the average is lower, the trend is either `:decreasing` or `:stable`.\n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple containing the calculated average, maximum, minimum and trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,375],"elapsed":3.061192409,"_type":"aimessage"}]
