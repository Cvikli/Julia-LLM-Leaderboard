Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can create a solution using Julia's built-in functionality and the Statistics package. Here is a way you could accomplish it:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps) \n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n        minTemp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if avg > maxTemp || avg < minTemp \n            return (average=avg, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=:increasing)\n        elseif avg == maxTemp && avg == minTemp\n            return (average=avg, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=:stable)\n        else \n            return (average=avg, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=:decreasing)\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with `nothing` for all values because there's no data to analyze. \n\nIf the list isn't empty, it calculates the average (`avg`), maximum (`maxTemp`), and minimum temperatures (`minTemp`) using functions from the Statistics package. It then checks which trend best describes these statistics: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`. \n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple with the results of its calculations.","status":200,"tokens":[0,357],"elapsed":2.866536704,"_type":"aimessage"}]
