[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's one way to implement this in Julia:\n\nFirst, add the Statistics package if it's not already installed. It's a standard library and should be included by default with any recent version of Julia. If it's not available for some reason, you can install it via the PkgManager using `Pkg.add(\"Statistics\")`.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n```\nThen write your function:\n\n```julia\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps) \n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        average = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        diff = max_temp - min_temp\n        \n        if diff > 0\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif diff < 0\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n\n        return (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function takes a vector of temperatures as input and returns a named tuple containing the average temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and the trend based on these values. If the list is empty, it will return all the values set to `nothing`. It's important to note that this function considers \"increasing\" or \"decreasing\" based on the overall range of temperatures.\n\nIf you want a specific trend like \"increasing for summer, decreasing for winter\", you would need more information about the data and it could get complex depending on how different seasons are represented in the dataset (e.g., whether they're separated by day or month).","status":200,"tokens":[0,412],"elapsed":3.368188231,"_type":"aimessage"}]
