Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an implementation of your request using Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics: mean, extrema, rankcorrelation \n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp, min_temp = extrema(temps)\n    \n    # Determine the trend by conducting Spearman's rank correlation test between a random permutation of the temperatures and the original data.\n    # A correlation of 1 indicates an increasing temperature trend; -1 indicates a decreasing one; otherwise, the trend is stable.\n    trend = ifelse(rankcorrelation(temps, shufflecols(temps)) > 0, :increasing, ifelse(rankcorrelation(temps, shufflecols(temps)) < 0, :decreasing, :stable))\n    \n    return (; average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the data list is empty. If it is, then it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average temperature and the maximum and minimum temperatures from the input data. Then, it conducts Spearman's rank correlation test on the original data versus a random permutation of the same data. The trend is determined based on the result: if the correlation is greater than 0, it's `:increasing`; if less than 0, it's `:decreasing`; otherwise, it's `:stable`.\n\nNote that `shufflecols` function for creating a random permutation of the temperatures is not provided in the question. For this specific code snippet to work you need to define this function which shuffles the columns in the given matrix.","status":200,"tokens":[0,438],"elapsed":3.505896818,"_type":"aimessage"}]
