This problem can be solved using the Statistics package and LinearAlgebra package in Julia. We'll first calculate the statistics like average, maximum and minimum temperatures from the provided list of daily temperatures. Then we will check if these values are increasing or decreasing to determine trend.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics: mean, extrema, findmax, findmin\ninclude(\"LinearAlgebra.jl\")  # You need to have LinearAlgebra.jl in your project folder\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    ntuple_fields = (:average, :max, :min, :trend)\n    \n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; [nothing for _ in 1:4]...)\n    end\n    \n    avg_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = findmax(temps)[1]\n    min_temp = findmin(temps)[1]\n    \n    if isapprox(avg_temp, max_temp; atol=0.5) && isapprox(avg_temp, min_temp; atol=0.5)\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif avg_temp > max_temp && avg_temp > min_temp \n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif avg_temp < max_temp && avg_temp < min_temp \n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nIn this function, we first check whether the list of daily temperatures is empty. If it is empty, we return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \nThen, we calculate the average, maximum and minimum temperatures from the list and determine if there's a trending in temperature based on these statistics. We determine the trend as :increasing if average > max > min, :decreasing if average < max < min and :stable otherwise. \nFinally, we return a named tuple containing average, maximum, minimum temperatures and their determined trend.","status":200,"tokens":[154,489],"elapsed":3.893694066,"_type":"aimessage"}]
