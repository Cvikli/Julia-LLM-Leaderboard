Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you might implement such a function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (avg=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max = maximum(temps)\n        min = minimum(temps)\n        trend = nothing\n        \n        if avg > 0.0\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif avg < 0.0\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n            \n        return (avg=avg, max=max, min=min, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of daily temperature data as input and checks if it's empty. If it is, the function creates a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf there are temperatures in the list, the function calculates the average (`avg`), maximum (`max`), minimum (`min`) temperatures, and sets the trend based on whether the average temperature is increasing, decreasing or is stable.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you've already run `using Statistics` to bring the `mean`, `maximum`, `minimum` functions in scope.","status":200,"tokens":[0,313],"elapsed":2.476461345,"_type":"aimessage"}]
