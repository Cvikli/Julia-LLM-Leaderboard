Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you might implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics: mean, minimum, maximum\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = round(mean(temps), digits=2)\n        min_temp = round(minimum(temps))\n        max_temp = round(maximum(temps))\n        if avg - min_temp > 0.1 && avg - max_temp < -0.1\n            return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:increasing)\n        elseif avg - min_temp < -0.1 && avg - max_temp > 0.1\n            return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:decreasing)\n        else\n            return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:stable)\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list of temperatures is empty. If it is, it constructs and returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf the list is not empty, it calculates the average (`avg`), minimum (`min_temp`), and maximum (`max_temp`) temperature from the given list using the `mean`, `minimum`, and `maximum` functions in Julia's Statistics package respectively. \n\nThen it checks whether the average temperature is increasing (greater than 0.1), decreasing (-0.1), or stable (within +/-0.1). Based on this, it returns a named tuple with these calculated values and their trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,421],"elapsed":3.343446235,"_type":"aimessage"}]
