Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could write this function in Julia. This solution uses the Statistics package for calculating the average and trend of the temperatures.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics: mean, max, min\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (;average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        average = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        # Determine the trend based on the difference between consecutive temperatures.\n        diffs = abs.(diff(temps))\n        if all(x -> x > 0, diffs)\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif all(x -> x < 0, diffs)\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n        \n        return (;average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list of temperatures is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf there are temperatures in the list, it calculates the average and maximum/minimum temperature using the `mean` and `extrema` functions from the Statistics package respectively. It then determines the trend based on whether all consecutive differences are positive or negative (indicating an increasing or decreasing trend). \n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple with the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,372],"elapsed":2.773649121,"_type":"aimessage"}]
