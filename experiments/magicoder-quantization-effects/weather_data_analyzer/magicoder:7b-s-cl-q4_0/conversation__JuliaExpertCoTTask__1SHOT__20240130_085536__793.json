Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you might solve this problem in Julia:\n\nFirst, add the Statistics package by using the `Pkg.add(\"Statistics\")` command in Julia. Then you can use functions like `mean`, `extrema`, and `corankind` from the Statistics package to perform statistical analyses on your data.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps) # Check if list is empty\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end \n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    (maxTemp, minTemp) = extrema(temps)\n    \n    # Determine the trend based on the difference between max and min temperatures.\n    if abs((minTemp - maxTemp)/avg) < 0.1\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif (maxTemp - avg)/avg > 0\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nIn the above function, `mean(temps)` returns the arithmetic mean of the temperatures. The `extrema` function returns a tuple of the minimum and maximum value in an iterable. \n\nThen we determine the trend based on the difference between minTemp and maxTemp and average temperature. If this difference is less than 10%, the trend is considered as :stable, if it's more than 10% then it's :increasing otherwise it's decreasing. \n\nFinally, the function returns a named tuple with `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures and `trend`. If the list of temps is empty, it will return all values as `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,434],"elapsed":3.369777862,"_type":"aimessage"}]
