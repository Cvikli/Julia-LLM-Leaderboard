[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics # import the statistics package for easy statistical operations\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps) # check if list is empty\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing) \n    else\n        avg = mean(temps) # calculate the average temperature\n        maxTemp = maximum(temps) # find the maximum temperature\n        minTemp = minimum(temps) # find the minimum temperature\n        \n        if avg > maxTemp # check if average is greater than max, trend should be decreasing\n            trend = :decreasing \n        elseif avg < minTemp # check if average is lesser than min, trend should be increasing\n            trend = :increasing  \n        else # if none of the above conditions are met, then it's stable\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n        \n        return (; average=avg, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend) \n    end\nend\n```\n\nNow you can call this function with your list of daily temperatures. For example:\n\n```julia\ntemps = [23, 24, 19, 26, 27, 25] # sample data\nprint(weather_data_analyzer(temps))\n```\nThis will output a named tuple with the average temperature, maximum and minimum temperatures, and trend. If you pass an empty list to this function it will return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,373],"elapsed":2.899923849,"_type":"aimessage"}]
