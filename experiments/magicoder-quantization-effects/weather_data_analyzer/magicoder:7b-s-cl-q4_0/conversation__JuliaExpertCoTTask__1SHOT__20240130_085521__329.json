Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple way to solve this problem in Julia:\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    trend_symbol = \"\"\n\n    if avg > first(temps) && avg < last(temps)\n        trend_symbol = \":stable\"\n    elseif avg > first(temps)\n        trend_symbol = \":increasing\"\n    else\n        trend_symbol = \":decreasing\"\n    end\n\n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend_symbol)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the input `temps` list is empty. If so, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures in the list. It then determines the trend based on comparing the average temperature with the initial and final temperatures in the list. If the average is between the first and last temperatures (i.e., it is neither decreasing nor increasing), it sets the trend to `:stable`.\nFinally, it returns a named tuple with these calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,329],"elapsed":2.553820534,"_type":"aimessage"}]
