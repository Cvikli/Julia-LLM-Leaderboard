Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem using Julia's built-in statistics functions. Here is an example of how you might write such a function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    if avg > max_temp\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif avg < min_temp\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function works by first checking if the list of temperatures is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. If not, it calculates the average (`avg`), maximum (`max_temp`), and minimum (`min_temp`) temperatures, then determines the `trend` based on these values.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the list of daily temperature data is in ascending order by date (i.e., from earliest to latest). If it's not, you might need to sort it first before applying the statistical analyses.","status":200,"tokens":[0,327],"elapsed":2.475045218,"_type":"aimessage"}]
