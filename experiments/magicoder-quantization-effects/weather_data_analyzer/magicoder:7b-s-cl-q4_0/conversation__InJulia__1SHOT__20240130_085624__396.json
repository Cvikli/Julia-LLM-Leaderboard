You can do this by typing `] add Statistics` into the REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop). Here's how you could define the function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if max_temp > average\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif max_temp < average\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else \n        trend = :stable\n    end\n  \n    return (; average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nYou can call this function with a list of daily temperatures. If the list is not empty, it will return a named tuple containing the `average`, `max`, `min` and `trend`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,264],"elapsed":2.013816426,"_type":"aimessage"}]
