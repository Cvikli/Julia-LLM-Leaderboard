Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia. \n\nFirstly, make sure that you have installed the Statistics package by running:\n```julia\nPkg.add(\"Statistics\")\n```\nThen, define your function like so:\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if avg > max_temp\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif avg < min_temp\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else \n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the `temps` list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf `temps` is not empty, it calculates the average (`avg`), maximum (`max_temp`), and minimum (`min_temp`) of the temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the Statistics package. \n\nThen, it checks if the average temperature is greater than the maximum or lesser than the minimum to determine the trend. If the average is greater than the max, then the trend is `:increasing`. If the average is lesser than the min, then the trend is `:decreasing`. Otherwise, the trend is `:stable`. \n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple with the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,407],"elapsed":3.041219563,"_type":"aimessage"}]
