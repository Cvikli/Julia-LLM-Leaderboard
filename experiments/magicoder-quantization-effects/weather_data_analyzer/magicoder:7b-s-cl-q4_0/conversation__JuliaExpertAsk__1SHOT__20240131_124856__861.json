Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`).

Note that I am assuming that the data given as input is always of type `Vector{Float64}`. \n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{T}) where T <: Real\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    trend_symbol = ifelse(avg > first(temps), :increasing, \n                          (avg < first(temps)) ? :decreasing : :stable)\n    \n    return (average= avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend = trend_symbol)\nend\n```\nThis function works by checking whether the input list is empty or not. If it's empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf the list isn't empty, it calculates the mean (`avg`), maximum (`max_temp`) and minimum (`min_temp` of the temperatures) using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package. It then determines the trend based on whether the average temperature is greater than, less than or equal to the first temperature in the list. The function uses a conditional expression (`ifelse`) to assign the correct symbol (`:increasing`, `:decreasing` or `:stable`) to `trend_symbol`.\n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple with the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[184,387],"elapsed":2.97018,"_type":"aimessage"}]
