This solution uses the `Statistics` package for calculating the average and trend of the data.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if avg > max_temp\n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif avg < min_temp\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf the list is not empty, it calculates the average temperature and the maximum and minimum temperatures using the `mean` and `extrema` functions from the `Statistics` package. It then checks if the average temperature is greater than or less than either of these extremes to determine the trend. \n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple with all the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[154,321],"elapsed":2.413184355,"_type":"aimessage"}]
