Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem using Julia's built-in functions. Here is an example of how you might write such a function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if avg > max_temp\n            trend = :decreasing\n        elseif avg < min_temp\n            trend = :increasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n        \n        return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures of the list and determines the trend based on whether the average is greater than or less than either the maximum or minimum temperature. It then constructs and returns a named tuple with these calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,282],"elapsed":2.094552395,"_type":"aimessage"}]
