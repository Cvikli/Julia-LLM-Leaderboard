Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you can solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if avg < max_temp - 10\n        return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=\"increasing\")\n    elseif avg > min_temp + 10\n        return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=\"decreasing\")\n    else\n        return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=\"stable\")\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the temperature data list is empty. If it's empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\nThen it calculates the average (`avg`), maximum (`max_temp`) and minimum (`min_temp`) temperatures using Julia's built-in `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions respectively. It then compares these computed values with specific conditions:\n\nIf `avg < max_temp - 10`, it means the trend is increasing, so it returns a named tuple with \"increasing\" as the value for the key \"trend\". Similarly, if `avg > min_temp + 10` it means the trend is decreasing, so it returns a named tuple with \"decreasing\" as the value for the key \"trend\". If none of these conditions are satisfied (i.e., if `avg` lies between `max_temp - 10` and `min_temp + 10`), then it means the trend is stable, so it returns a named tuple with \"stable\" as the value for the key \"trend\". All other values are stored in a named tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,485],"elapsed":3.710571425,"_type":"aimessage"}]
