If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia. Firstly, we need to install Statistics package if it's not already installed. You can do that by running `]add Statistics` in your REPL.\n\nHere is the solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Check if list is empty\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Determine the trend based on the difference between consecutive elements in the list\n    diffs = diff(temps)\n    if all(x -> x > 0, diffs)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(x -> x < 0, diffs)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf the list is not empty, it calculates the average (`avg`), maximum (`max_temp`) and minimum (`min_temp`) temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the Statistics package.\n\nThen it determines the trend of the temperature data based on whether all consecutive differences are positive, negative or zero. If they're all positive, it sets the trend to `:increasing`. If they're all negative, it sets the trend to `:decreasing`. Otherwise (if there are both positive and negative differences), it sets the trend to `:stable`.\n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple with these calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,453],"elapsed":3.375171664,"_type":"aimessage"}]
