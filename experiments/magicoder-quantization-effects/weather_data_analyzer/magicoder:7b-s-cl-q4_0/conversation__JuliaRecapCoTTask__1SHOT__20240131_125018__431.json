[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example solution in Julia. This solution uses the Statistics package for calculating the average and trend of the temperatures:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics, NamedTuple\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (;average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    maxTemps = maximum(temps)\n    minTemps = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if maxTemps - average > 0.1\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif average - minTemps > 0.1\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (;average=average, max=maxTemps, min=minTemps, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function works by first checking if the list of temperatures is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf the list is not empty, it calculates the average temperature using the `mean` function from the Statistics package and stores it in the variable `average`. It also calculates the maximum and minimum temperatures using the `maximum` and `minimum` functions respectively. \n\nThen, it checks if the maximum temperature is greater than the average by more than 0.1 degrees Celsius or the minimum temperature is lesser than the average by more than 0.1 degrees Celsius. If either condition is true, the function sets `trend` to `:increasing` or `:decreasing`, respectively. Otherwise, it sets `trend` to `:stable`.\n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple containing the calculated average, maximum and minimum temperatures along with the trend.","status":200,"tokens":[11,420],"elapsed":3.284588475,"_type":"aimessage"}]
