Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could create such a function in Julia. Note that it uses the Statistics package which must be added in your code beforehand:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        average_temp = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        trend_symbol = ifelse(max_temp - min_temp > 0.5 * abs(average_temp), :increasing, \n                               ifelse(min_temp - max_temp > 0.5 * abs(average_temp), :decreasing, :stable))\n        return (average = average_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend_symbol)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty. If it's not, it computes the mean and maximum values of the data, then compares these to compute a \"trend\" symbol. The trend symbol can be either `:increasing`, `:decreasing` or `:stable`. \n\nFinally, it constructs and returns a named tuple with all required information. If the list is empty, it returns a named tuple with everything set to `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,328],"elapsed":2.502220266,"_type":"aimessage"}]
