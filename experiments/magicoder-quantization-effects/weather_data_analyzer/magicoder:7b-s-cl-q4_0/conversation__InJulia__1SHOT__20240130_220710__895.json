[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia using the Statistics package. Note that we need to import the Statistics package before running the code:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        average = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if max_temp > average\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif max_temp < average\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n    \n        return (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function works by first checking if the `temps` list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. Otherwise, it calculates the average and maximum temperatures, then checks which of these is greater. Based on this, it sets the trend field in the returned named tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,268],"elapsed":1.981836007,"_type":"aimessage"}]
