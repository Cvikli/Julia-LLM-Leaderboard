[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an implementation of the function using Julia programming language:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics \n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    elseif maximum(temps) - minimum(temps) < 0.1\n        return (average = mean(temps), max = maximum(temps), min = minimum(temps), trend = :stable)\n    elseif maximum(temps) > minimum(temps)\n        return (average = mean(temps), max = maximum(temps), min = minimum(temps), trend = :increasing)\n    else\n        return (average = mean(temps), max = maximum(temps), min = minimum(temps), trend = :decreasing)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `Statistics` package to calculate the mean, maximum and minimum of the input list. It checks if this list is empty or contains only a single unique value (within a small tolerance for floating point number comparison). If it does, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\nOtherwise, depending on whether the maximum temperature is larger than the minimum one, it determines the trend as `:increasing`, `:decreasing` or `:stable`.\n\nIt's worth noting that this function doesn't check if the temperatures are increasing monotonically or decreasing. If that's required, more complex logic would be needed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,345],"elapsed":2.709877781,"_type":"aimessage"}]
