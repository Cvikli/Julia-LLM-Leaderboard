Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package).

If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you can implement this in Julia. This code uses the Statistics package to compute the mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures. It then compares these values to determine whether the trend is increasing, decreasing or stable.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics: mean, extrema, minmax\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_val, min_val = extrema(temps)\n        \n        if avg > max_val\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif avg < min_val\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n        \n        return (average=avg, max=max_val, min=min_val, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first checking if the input list `temps` is empty. If it is, it constructs and returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf `temps` is not empty, it calculates the mean of the temperatures using `mean(temps)`, maximum temperature using `extrema(temps)` and minimum temperature. Then, it compares these calculated values to determine whether the trend is increasing, decreasing or stable. This comparison is done by checking if the average is greater than the max value, less than the min value, or equal to both.\n\nThe function then constructs and returns a named tuple with keys `average`, `max`, `min` and `trend`. The values of these keys are set as per the calculated mean, maximum and minimum temperatures and trend respectively.","status":200,"tokens":[0,409],"elapsed":3.091487887,"_type":"aimessage"}]
