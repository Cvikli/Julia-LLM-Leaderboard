Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of a Julia program that would solve the problem as described:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # check if temps list is empty\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n    \n    # compute statistical values\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if temps[1] < temps[2]\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif temps[1] > temps[2]\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function starts by checking if the input list `temps` is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. Otherwise, it computes the average (`avg`), maximum (`max_temp`), minimum (`min_temp`) and trend of the temperatures using `mean()`, `maximum()`, `minimum()` functions respectively, and compares first two elements in the list to determine if the temperature is increasing, decreasing or stable. Finally, it returns a named tuple with the computed values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,320],"elapsed":2.474084352,"_type":"aimessage"}]
