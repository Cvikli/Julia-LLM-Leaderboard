Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you could implement this in Julia. I am assuming that the trend refers to whether the temperature data shows an upward, downward or no trend at all (i.e., it is stable).\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics: mean, extrema, firstindex, lastindex\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        rng = extrema(temps)\n        mx, mn = firstindex(temps), lastindex(temps)\n        if temps[mx] > temps[mn]  # Max temp is higher than min temp\n            trend_symbol = :increasing\n        elseif temps[mx] < temps[mn]  # Min temp is higher than max temp\n            trend_symbol = :decreasing\n        else  # No temperature trend, possibly stable data\n            trend_symbol = :stable\n        end\n        \n        return (; average=avg, max=temps[mx], min=temps[mn], trend=trend_symbol)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function works by first checking if the list of temperatures is empty. If it is, it creates and returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. If the list is not empty, it calculates the average temperature, finds the maximum and minimum temperatures, and then uses these to determine the trend (increasing or decreasing).\n\nPlease note that you need to have Statistics.jl package installed in your Julia environment to run this function. You can install this package using Pkg.add(\"Statistics\") command in Julia REPL.","status":200,"tokens":[184,396],"elapsed":3.108595463,"_type":"aimessage"}]
