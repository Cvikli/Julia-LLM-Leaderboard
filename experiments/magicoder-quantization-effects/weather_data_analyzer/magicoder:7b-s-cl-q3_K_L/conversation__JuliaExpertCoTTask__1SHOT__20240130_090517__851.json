Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you would solve this problem using the Julia programming language:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        if max_temp > avg && max_temp - avg > 0.1 * abs(max_temp), trend=:increasing elseif max_temp < avg, trend=:decreasing else trend=:stable end\n    end\n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list is empty. If it is, it constructs a named tuple with all fields set to `nothing`. If not, it calculates the mean (`average`), maximum (`max`) and minimum (`min`) values in the array. Then it determines the trend by comparing the average temperature with the maximum temperature: if it's increasing, the trend is `:increasing`; if it's decreasing, the trend is `:decreasing`; otherwise, the trend is `:stable`. Finally, it returns a new named tuple containing these values.\n\nTo test the function with your provided data you can run:\n\n```julia\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,366],"elapsed":2.98842244,"_type":"aimessage"}]
