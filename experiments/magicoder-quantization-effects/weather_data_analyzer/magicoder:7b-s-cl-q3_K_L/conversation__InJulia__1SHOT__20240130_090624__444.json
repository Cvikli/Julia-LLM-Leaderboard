The `Statistics` package provides methods for calculating average and extrema:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics  # To use mean() and extrema()\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps) \n        return (average = nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    average = mean(temps)\n    range = extrema(temps)\n    max = range.max\n    min = range.min\n    \n    if average < temps[1]  # Checks if the first temp is higher than average \n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif average > temps[1]  # Checks if the first temp is lower than average \n        trend = :increasing\n    else \n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (average=average, max=max, min=min, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nIn this function:\n- `isempty(temps)` checks if the list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n- `mean(temps)` and `extrema(temps)` calculate the average and range (minimum and maximum) of the temperatures respectively.\n- The function then checks trend based on first temperature in the list. If it is higher than average, the trend is set to `:increasing`. If it is lower, the trend is set to `:decreasing`, otherwise the trend is `:stable`. \n- Finally, a named tuple with the results of the statistical analysis is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,381],"elapsed":3.065016491,"_type":"aimessage"}]
