Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution using Julia:\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        average = mean(temps)\n        maxTemperature = maximum(temps)\n        minTemperature = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if average > maxTemperature\n            trend = :decreasing\n        elseif average < maxTemperature\n            trend = :increasing\n        else \n            trend = :stable\n        end\n\n        return (average=average, max=maxTemperature, min=minTemperature, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the `temps` list is empty.

Otherwise, it calculates the average temperature and the maximum/minimum temperatures from the data using Julia's inbuilt statistics package (`Statistics`). It then determines whether the trend of temperature is increasing, decreasing or stable by comparing the average temperature to the highest temperature value in the list.\nFinally, a named tuple with calculated `average`, `max`, `min` and `trend` values is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,304],"elapsed":2.473711608,"_type":"aimessage"}]
