Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you might write this code:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    maximum = maximum(temps)\n    minimum = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if length(temps) < 2\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif temps[1] < temps[2]\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=maximum, min=minimum, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list is empty.

If there are at least two temperature readings, then it determines whether the trend is increasing (`temps[1] < temps[2]`), decreasing (`temps[1] > temps[2]`), or stable.\n\nThe function returns a named tuple containing the average, maximum, minimum, and trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,358],"elapsed":2.92071782,"_type":"aimessage"}]
