Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can do this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n    minTemp = minimum(temps)\n\n    diff = maxTemp - minTemp\n    if diff > 0\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif diff < 0\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=average, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the input list `temps` is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf `temps` isn't empty, it calculates the average temperature using the mean function from the Statistics package and finds the maximum and minimum temperatures. It then compares the difference between the maximum and minimum temperatures to determine the trend and returns a named tuple with all these values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,277],"elapsed":2.226104941,"_type":"aimessage"}]
