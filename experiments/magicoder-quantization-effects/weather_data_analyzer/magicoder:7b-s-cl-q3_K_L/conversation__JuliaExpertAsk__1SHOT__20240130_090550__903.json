Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this task in Julia. \n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nstruct WeatherDataAnalysisResults\n    average::Union{Float64, Nothing}\n    max::Union{Float64, Nothing}\n    min::Union{Float64, Nothing}\n    trend::Union{Symbol, Nothing}\nend\n\nweather_data_analyzer(temps) = begin\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return WeatherDataAnalysisResults(nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing)\n    else\n        avg_temp = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        diff = max_temp - min_temp\n    \n        if diff > 0\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif diff < 0\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n\n        return WeatherDataAnalysisResults(avg_temp, max_temp, min_temp, trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list is empty. If it is, it constructs a `WeatherDataAnalysisResults` object with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf the list is not empty, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package. It then determines the trend based on the difference between the maximum and minimum temperature values. If this difference is positive, the trend is set to `:increasing`; if it's negative, the trend is set to `:decreasing`; otherwise, the trend is set to `:stable`. \n\nFinally, it constructs a `WeatherDataAnalysisResults` object with these calculated values and returns it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,420],"elapsed":3.394925547,"_type":"aimessage"}]
