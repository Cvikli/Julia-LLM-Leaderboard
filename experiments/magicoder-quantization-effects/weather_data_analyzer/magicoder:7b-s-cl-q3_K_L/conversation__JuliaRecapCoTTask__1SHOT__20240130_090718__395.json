[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`).

Julia's \"Statistics\" package provides functions that compute descriptive statistics of arrays like mean, median, etc. Here is how you can write a function `weather_data_analyzer`:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics # Import necessary package\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps) \n        return (; average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing) # If temps list is empty, return named tuple with nothing values.\n    else\n        avgTemp = mean(temps)\n        maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n        minTemp = minimum(temps)\n        trendVal = maxTemp - minTemp\n        if trendVal == 0 \n            trend = :stable\n        elseif trendVal > 0\n            trend = :increasing\n        else\n            trend = :decreasing\n        end\n    \n        return (; average = avgTemp, max = maxTemp, min = minTemp, trend = trend) # Return named tuple with computed values.\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the given list `temps` is empty or not. If it's empty, then it returns a named tuple with all fields set to `nothing`. If it's not empty, it calculates the average (`avgTemp`), maximum (`maxTemp`) and minimum temperature (`minTemp`). Then, it determines the trend of the temperature data based on its difference. If this difference is 0, then the trend is considered stable; if the difference is positive, the trend is increasing; otherwise, the trend is decreasing. Finally, it returns a named tuple containing these computed values.\n\nRemember to add `using Statistics` at the top of your code before defining this function. The package \"Statistics\" does not come pre-installed and needs to be added using Julia's built-in package manager (`Pkg`).","status":200,"tokens":[0,450],"elapsed":3.753973096,"_type":"aimessage"}]
