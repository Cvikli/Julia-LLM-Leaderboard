Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`).

If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf the list is not empty, it calculates the mean (average), maximum, and minimum temperature using functions from the `Statistics` package. It then checks for trends in the data by taking differences between consecutive temperatures. If the difference is always greater than zero (indicating an increasing trend), it returns a named tuple with the average, max, min, and trend set to :increasing. If the difference is less than zero (an decreasing trend), it sets the trend accordingly. \nIf the trends are not consistently increasing or decreasing, it sets the trend as :stable.","status":200,"tokens":[0,402],"elapsed":3.241124088,"_type":"aimessage"}]
