Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia. We will use the Statistics package to calculate average, maximum and minimum temperatures:\n\nFirst, let's install the package using the Pkg.add() function:\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"Statistics\")\n```\nThen we can define our function:\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        trend = ifelse(avg > temps[1], :increasing, (avg < temps[1]) ? :decreasing : :stable)\n    end\n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty. If it's not, it calculates average, maximum and minimum temperatures using functions from the Statistics package. Then, it determines the trend of temperature changes (increasing, decreasing, or stable). Finally, it returns all these calculated values in a named tuple.\n  \nNote: This function assumes that the first temperature is lower than the next one for increasing trend and higher for decreasing trend. If this assumption does not hold for your specific use case, you might need to adjust the trend determination part of the code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,357],"elapsed":2.883221832,"_type":"aimessage"}]
