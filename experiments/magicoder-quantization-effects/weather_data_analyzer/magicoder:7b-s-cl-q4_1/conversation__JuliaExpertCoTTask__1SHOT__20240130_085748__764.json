Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem using the following Julia code:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    maxT = maximum(temps)\n    minT = minimum(temps)\n    \n    trends = [:increasing, :decreasing, :stable]\n    diff = diff([0; temps])\n    if diff[1] < 0\n        trend = trends[2]\n    elseif diff[1] > 0\n        trend = trends[1]\n    else\n        trend = trends[3]\n    end\n    \n    return (average=avg, max=maxT, min=minT, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function starts by checking if the `temps` list is empty.
