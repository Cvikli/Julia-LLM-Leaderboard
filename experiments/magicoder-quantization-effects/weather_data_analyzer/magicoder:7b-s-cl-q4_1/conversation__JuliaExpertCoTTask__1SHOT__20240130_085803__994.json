Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia solution:\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    if avg == max_temp\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif avg < max_temp\n        trend = :increasing\n    else \n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n    \n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nIn this function, we first check if the `temps` list is empty. If it is, we return a named tuple with all values set to nothing. Then, we calculate the mean (average), maximum and minimum temperatures of the data. We compare these calculated values to determine the trend: `:stable` if average equals max temperature, `:increasing` if average is less than max, otherwise `:decreasing`.\n\nFinally, we return a named tuple with the computed mean, max and min temperatures and the determined trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,293],"elapsed":2.398938045,"_type":"aimessage"}]
