Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem in Julia by using the `Statistics` package. This package provides functions for basic statistical operations. \n\nHere is a possible implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n    minTemp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if avg > first(temps)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif avg < last(temps)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n        \n    return (average=avg, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function works by first checking if the temperature list is empty. If it is, then it returns a named tuple with nothing as all values. If not, it calculates the average temperature and both the minimum and maximum temperatures from the given list. Then, depending on the comparison of average temperature to the lowest and highest temperatures in the list, it decides whether there is an increasing trend, a decreasing trend or no trend at all. Finally, it constructs a named tuple with these results and returns it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,314],"elapsed":2.550885739,"_type":"aimessage"}]
