[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise.

Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is an example of how you can approach this problem using Julia programming language:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        average = mean(temps)\n        maxTemperature = maximum(temps)\n        minTemperature = minimum(temps)\n        trend = ifelse(maxTemperature > last(temps), :increasing, \n                       ifelse(minTemperature < last(temps), :decreasing, :stable))\n        return (average=average, max=maxTemperature, min=minTemperature, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first checks whether the list is empty. If it is, then it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the `average`, `max` and `min` temperatures using built-in functions from the `Statistics` package in Julia. It also determines the trend by comparing the maximum temperature with the last value in the list (assuming that this is how you determine a \"trend\"). Then it returns these values as a named tuple.\nPlease note that you need to use `Statistics` package if it's not installed yet, you can do so using the package manager by typing `]add Statistics` on your terminal/command prompt.","status":200,"tokens":[0,333],"elapsed":2.691439078,"_type":"aimessage"}]
