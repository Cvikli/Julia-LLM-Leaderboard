Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example solution written in Julia. It uses the Statistics package for basic statistical operations on arrays and uses a conditional to determine the trend based on whether the temperatures are increasing or decreasing:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)  # If list is empty, return named tuple with nothing values\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)  # Compute average temperature\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)  # Find the highest temp in the array\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)  # Find the lowest temp in the array\n    \n    if first(temps) < last(temps)  # If first temp is less than last, trend is \"increasing\"\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif first(temps) > last(temps)  # If first temp is greater than last, trend is \"decreasing\"\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else  # Trend is \"stable\" if the temperatures are not increasing or decreasing\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)  # Return named tuple\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,315],"elapsed":2.582543902,"_type":"aimessage"}]
