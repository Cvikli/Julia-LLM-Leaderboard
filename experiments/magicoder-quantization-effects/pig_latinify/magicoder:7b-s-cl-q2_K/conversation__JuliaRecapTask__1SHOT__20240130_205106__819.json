[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution using Julia's parallel computing features:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strs)\n    function pig_latin_word(w::AbstractString, i=1) \n        return w[end-i+1:end]*w[1:end-i]*\"ay\"\n    end\n    \n    threads = [Threads.Thread(()->begin; str = pop!(strs); @printf(\"%s \", pig_latin_word(str)); end) for i in 1:length(strs)]\n    Threads.tic()\n    [run(t) for t in threads]\n    Threads.toc()\nend\n```\nYou can call this function with a list of strings as follows: `pig_latinify([ \"apple\", \"orange\" ])`. This will print out the pig latin version of each word. Be aware that Julia's parallel processing facilities are thread-based, not process-based. If you have multiple cores/threads available in your machine, some may be idle while others are working, and this might affect your performance if it doesn't balance well.\n\nNote: This is a simplified solution and there are many complexities associated with converting strings to pig latin (e.g., words ending in \"qu\" or \"sch\", which do not get doubled), but it should give you a good starting point for your task.","status":200,"tokens":[0,318],"elapsed":2.440431217,"_type":"aimessage"}]
