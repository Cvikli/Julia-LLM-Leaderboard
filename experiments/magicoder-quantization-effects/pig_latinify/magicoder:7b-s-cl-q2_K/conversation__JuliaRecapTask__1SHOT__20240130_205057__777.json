[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin.

Here is a possible solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads: @spawn\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)\n    pig_latin = [@spawn((str -> begin \n        if str[1] âˆˆ ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'] \n            return \"$(str[2:end]*\"ay\")\"\n        elseif ismatch(r\"^[aeiou]\",str)\n            return \"$(str[2:end]*\"ay\")\"\n        else\n            return \"$(str*'ay')\"\n        end) for str in strings]...)\n    waitall(pig_latin)\n    [fetchval(x) for x in pig_latin]\nend\n```\nThis function creates a vector of tasks (`@spawn`) where each task is the translation of a string into pig latin. It then waits until all tasks have been completed using `waitall` before fetching the values from those tasks and returning them as a new array.\n\nNote: The Julia's `@spawn` macro will create a new process for every computationally-intensive operation (such as string translations), which can slow down the performance if you have too many strings to translate. In such case, consider using `Distributed` or other parallel computing frameworks of Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[0,327],"elapsed":2.48974483,"_type":"aimessage"}]
