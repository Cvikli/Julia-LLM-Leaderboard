It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem, we can use Python's multithreading module to create threads for each task in the loop. Here is an implementation:\n\n```python\nimport concurrent.futures\n\ndef pig_latinify(words):\n    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:\n        results = list(executor.map(lambda word: pig_latinify_single_word(word), words))\n    return results\n\ndef pig_latinify_single_word(word):\n    if len(word) > 0 and word[0].isalpha():\n        return f\"{word[1:]}{word[:1]}_ay\"\n    else:\n        return word\n```\n\nIn the `pig_latinify` function, we use a thread pool to transform each word in the input vector. For each word, we call the `pig_latinify_single_word` function which implements the Pig Latin transformation rule on a single word. \n\nThe Pig Latin translation of a word begins with the first letter and ends with \"_ay\". So for instance, if you have the word \"apple\", it becomes \"pple_apple\" after translating to Pig Latin. \n\nPlease note that this code is intended to be executed in Python environment. The Python's `concurrent.futures` module makes use of threads to execute our transformations asynchronously, which results in better performance.","status":200,"tokens":[142,323],"elapsed":9.877988379,"_type":"aimessage"}]
