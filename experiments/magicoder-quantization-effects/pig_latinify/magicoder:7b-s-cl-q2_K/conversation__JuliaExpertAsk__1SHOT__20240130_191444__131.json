It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Pig Latin is a type of language game where you take an English word, move the first letter to the end, and then add \"ay\". However, there's one exception â€“ if the word begins with a vowel sounding in English (like \"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", or \"u\"), it should just have the suffix added at the end.\n\nHere is an example of how you can do this:\n```python\ndef pig_latinify(words):\n    # List to hold our transformed words\n    transformed = []\n    \n    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:\n        future_to_word = {executor.submit(pig_latin, word): word for word in words}\n        for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(future_to_word):\n            try:\n                transformed.append(future.result())\n            except Exception as e:\n                print('Caught exception in worker thread')\n                \n    return transformed\n``` \nIn this code, we use the Python concurrent.futures library to perform a parallel transformation of each word. This can significantly speed up the process for long lists of words. The results are appended to the `transformed` list which is then returned at the end.","status":200,"tokens":[0,289],"elapsed":2.183820694,"_type":"aimessage"}]
