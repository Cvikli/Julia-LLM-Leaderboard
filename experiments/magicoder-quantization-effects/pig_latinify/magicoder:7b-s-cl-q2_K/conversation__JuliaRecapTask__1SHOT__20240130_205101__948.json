[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example implementation of the `pig_latinify` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    # Create a queue to store unprocessed strings\n    q = Queue{String}()\n    \n    # Enqueue all input strings onto the queue\n    for s in strings\n        enqueue!(q, s)\n    end\n\n    @threads for i in 1:nprocs()\n        while !isempty(q)\n            # Dequeue a string from the queue\n            s = dequeue!(q)\n            \n            # Split the string into words\n            words = split(s)\n            \n            # Process each word and store it back in the queue\n            enqueue!(q, map((w,i)->i>0 ? \"$(w)$(w[1:end-2])$(i)\" : w, words)...)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Drain the queue into a vector of strings\n    return [dequeue!(q) for _ in 1:nitems(q)]\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we first convert the input array into a Queue to maintain the order of processing. For each string `s` in the queue, we split it into words and then transform each word into pig latin. The transformed words are then stored back into the queue for further processing. Finally, the queue is drained and returned as an array of strings.\n\nThe `@threads` macro allows us to process multiple strings simultaneously using multiple threads. This can significantly improve performance if you have a multicore CPU and a large number of strings.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that words are separated by spaces and does not handle punctuation attached to the last word of each sentence. You may need to modify this function according to your specific needs.","status":200,"tokens":[0,412],"elapsed":3.150275654,"_type":"aimessage"}]
