It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Python solution for your problem:\n\n```python\nimport concurrent.futures\n\ndef pig_latinify(strings):\n    def translate_word(word):\n        if word[0] in 'aeiou':\n            return f'{word}way'\n        else:\n            return f'{word[1:]}{word[0]}ay'\n\n    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:\n        translations = list(executor.map(translate_word, strings))\n    \n    return translations\n```\n\nTo use this function you can call it like this: `pig_latinify(['hello', 'world'])`\nThe `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor()` allows us to easily run the translation in parallel for each word in the input list.\n\nPlease note, multithreading might not be ideal solution in Python due to Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). For CPU-bound tasks it's better to use processes or async/await for IO-bound tasks. In case of Julia language, we should consider using different approach: https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/multithreading/#man-multithreaded-execution","status":200,"tokens":[0,277],"elapsed":2.096279132,"_type":"aimessage"}]
