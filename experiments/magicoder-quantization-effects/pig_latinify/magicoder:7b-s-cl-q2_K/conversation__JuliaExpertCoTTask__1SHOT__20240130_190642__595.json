Each thread converts the words in its input string into Pig Latin and stores this result as the `result` attribute of the corresponding Thread object. After all threads have finished, the function collects the results from these attributes and returns them as a list of strings.\n\nKeep in mind that due to the limitations of Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), it may not be possible to create new threads for each word transformation if you are using other languages than CPython, such as Jython or IronPython because of the absence of threading support. In these cases, you might need to use processes instead of threads.","status":200,"tokens":[230,434],"elapsed":12.711758113,"_type":"aimessage"}]
