[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia code for solving the problem. This code uses multithreading to convert every word of a sentence to Pig Latin:\n\n```julia\nimport Base.Threads.@threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(sentence::AbstractString)\n    words = split(sentence, \" \")  # split the sentence into individual words\n    result = String[]  # vector for storing each Pig Latin word\n\n    @threads for word in words  # iterate over every word in a separate thread\n        if occursin(r\"[aeiouy]\", lowercase(word))  # check if word starts with vowel sound\n            push!(result, \"$(uppercasefirst(word))ay\")  # add word to Pig Latin sentence\n        else\n            push!(result, \"$(lowercase(word[2:end]))$(uppercasefirst(word[1]))ay\")  # add word to Pig Latin sentence\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(result, \" \")  # join all words together with a space\nend\n```\n\nYou can call this function for transforming an entire vector of strings into Pig Latin like so:\n\n```julia\nsentences = [\"apple\", \"orange\", \"banana\"]\npig_latin_sentences = pig_latinify.(sentences)  # Vector{String}\n```\nThis code works by iterating over each word in the input sentence and applying the Pig Latin transformation. The `@threads` macro is used to parallelize this operation, allowing for more efficient conversion of a large number of sentences.","status":200,"tokens":[11,357],"elapsed":3.282342625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
