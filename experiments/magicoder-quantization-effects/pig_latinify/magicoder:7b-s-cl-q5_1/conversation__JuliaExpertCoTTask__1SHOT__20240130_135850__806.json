This helper function takes the first letter of the input string and appends it with the rest of the string followed by \"ay\". The `Threads.@threads for...end` loop iterates over each string in the input list, running the transformation on a separate thread for each word.\n\nThe output will be:\n```julia\n\"ellohayapplayorkstroongway\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,267],"elapsed":2.414954636,"_type":"aimessage"}]
