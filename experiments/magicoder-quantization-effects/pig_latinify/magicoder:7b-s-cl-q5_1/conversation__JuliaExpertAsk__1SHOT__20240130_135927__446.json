It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example in Julia how you can create such function:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strs)\n    # Create a channel to send strings for processing\n    chan = Channel{String}(Inf)\n\n    @async begin \n        for str in strs\n            put!(chan, str)\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Create an array to store the results\n    res = String[]\n\n    @sync for i in 1:length(strs)\n        # Process each string on a separate thread\n        @async begin\n            word = take!(chan)\n            push!(res, pig_latin_word(word))\n        end\n    end\n\n    return res\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_word(word)\n    # Implement the logic to transform a word into Pig Latin\n    words = split(word, ' ')\n    \n    for (i, w) in enumerate(words)\n        if islowercase(w[1])\n            words[i] = lowercase(vowels_moved(w)) * uppercase(w)[2:end] * \"ay\" \n        elseif isuppercase(w[1])\n            words[i] = uppercase(vowels_moved(w)) * w[2:end] * \"AY\" \n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(words, ' ')\nend\n\nfunction vowels_moved(s)\n    first_vowel = findfirst(isequal(a), s)\n    if !isnothing(first_vowel) && islowercase(s[1])\n        return replace(s, a => \"ay\", 1) * a\n    elseif !isnothing(first_vowel) && isuppercase(s[1])\n        return replace(s, a => \"AY\", 1) * a\n    end\n    \n    return s\nend\n```\nThis code defines two helper functions `pig_latin_word` and `vowels_moved`. `pig_latin_word` is used to process each word individually. If the first letter of a word is vowel, it moves that vowel to the end of the word and appends \"ay\". If the word starts with an uppercase consonant, it converts the whole word into upper case and performs the same operation as described in `vowels_moved` function.\nThe main function `pig_latinify`, creates a channel to send strings for processing and another one to receive transformed words. It then runs several threads: one to send strings and other to receive and process them. The results are collected in the array. The whole process is synchronized by `@sync`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,620],"elapsed":5.495573969,"_type":"aimessage"}]
