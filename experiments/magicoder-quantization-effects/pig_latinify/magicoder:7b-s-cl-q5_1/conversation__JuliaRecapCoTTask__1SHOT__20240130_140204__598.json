[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use Julia's built-in concurrency features with the `@threads` macro for this task. Here is an example of how you might create such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    results = Vector{String}()\n    @sync @threads for string in strings\n        result = translate(string) # replace this with your actual translation logic\n        push!(results, result)\n    end\n    return results\nend\n```\n\nPlease note that the `translate` function is a placeholder and needs to be replaced by your actual code for transforming each string into pig latin.\n\nThis function will run the translations in parallel using multiple threads. The `@sync @threads` syntax allows us to safely use multiple threads with the `@threads` macro.\n\nIf you want to execute instructions, those must be added as a parameter of this function and called within the loop like shown below:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String}, instructions)\n    results = Vector{String}()\n    @sync @threads for string in strings\n        result = translate(string, instructions) # replace this with your actual translation logic\n        push!(results, result)\n    end\n    return results\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,286],"elapsed":2.579870915,"_type":"aimessage"}]
