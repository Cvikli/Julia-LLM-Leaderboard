[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could solve this task using Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strs::Vector{String})\n    result = similar(strs)\n    \n    @threads for i in eachindex(result)\n        word = strs[i]\n        first, rest = split(word, r\"(\\b)\")\n        result[i] = string(rest, first, \"ay\")\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over the input vector of strings in a parallelized manner using the `@threads` macro provided by Julia. For each string, it separates into the initial consonant cluster (if any) and the rest of the word (`first`) and appends \"ay\" to the end of `rest`.\n\nPlease note that this is a very simple implementation and might not handle all possible cases for Pig Latin rules (like capital letters, punctuation marks, etc.). You might want to add more error checking and handling depending on your specific needs.","status":200,"tokens":[0,240],"elapsed":2.203401028,"_type":"aimessage"}]
