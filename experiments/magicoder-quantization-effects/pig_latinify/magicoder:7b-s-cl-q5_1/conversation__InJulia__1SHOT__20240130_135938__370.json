It checks whether the first letter of each word is a vowel or not and transforms it accordingly. \n\nThe main function `pig_latinify` processes an array of strings in parallel using multiple threads thanks to Julia's built-in support for threading. Each string in the vector is transformed independently in its own thread, resulting in faster execution on multi-core processors.","status":200,"tokens":[0,322],"elapsed":2.896063968,"_type":"aimessage"}]
