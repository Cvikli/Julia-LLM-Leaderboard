It then applies this function to each element in the array of words using `@distributed for`. The `@sync` macro ensures that the main thread waits until all worker threads have finished processing their tasks before proceeding with the rest of your program.","status":200,"tokens":[0,414],"elapsed":4.136302001,"_type":"aimessage"}]
