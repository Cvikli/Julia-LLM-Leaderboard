[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Here's a simple implementation of your task:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    @sync begin\n        for string in strings\n            @async begin\n                println(\"Pig Latin version of \\\"$(string)\\\" is \\\"$(pig_latin(string))\\\"\")\n            end\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(s::AbstractString)\n    words = split(s, ' ')\n    piglated_words = map(words) do word\n        if startswith(word, vowels)\n            string(\"$(word[2:end])ay\")\n        else\n            string(\"$(word[2:end])$(word[1])ay\")\n        end\n    end\n    return join(piglated_words, \" \")\nend\n\nvowels = [\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"]\n```\nYou can call `pig_latinify` with a list of strings as the argument.
