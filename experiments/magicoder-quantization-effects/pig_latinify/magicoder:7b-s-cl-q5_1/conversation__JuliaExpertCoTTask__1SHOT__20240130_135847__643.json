[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    result = []\n    @async for word in words\n        push!(result, pig_latin_transform(word))\n    end\n    return result\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_transform(word::AbstractString)\n   # Split the word into a tuple of characters\n    vowels = ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')\n    first, rest = split(word, \"\")\n    isuppercase(first[1]) && (first = uppercase(first))\n    if first[1] in vowels\n        return first*rest*\"ay\"\n    else\n        return first*rest*\",ay\"\n    end\nend\n```\nThe `pig_latinify` function takes a list of words as input and returns a list of pig latinified words. It does this by creating an asynchronous task that loops over each word in the input array, applying the `pig_latin_transform` function to it.\n\nThe `pig_latin_transform` function transforms a single word into pig latin. If the first letter of the word is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), it appends \"ay\" to the end of the word. Otherwise, it appends \",ay\" to the end of the word.\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function returns an array containing the pig latinified versions of each input string. It does this by creating a new array and using the `@async for` syntax to iterate over the input strings in parallel, applying the `pig_latin_transform` function to each one and adding the result to the array.\n\nNote: This code assumes that you're using Julia version 1.0 or later, because it uses the new `@async` macro for creating asynchronous tasks which was introduced in Julia version 1.0.","status":200,"tokens":[0,435],"elapsed":3.973740745,"_type":"aimessage"}]
