It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example in Julia:\n```julia\nusing Distributed\naddprocs() # This creates additional processes to execute the task parallelly\n@everywhere using Distributed\n@everywhere function pig_latinify(strs)\n    result = []\n    @sync for str in strs\n        push!(result, @spawnat :any pig_latin_word(str))\n    end\n    return collect(fetch.([result...]; waitall=true))\nend\n@everywhere function pig_latin_word(word)\n    first = word[1]\n    rest = word[2:end]\n    return \"$(rest)$(first)ay\"\nend\n```\nHere we make use of Julia's `@spawnat` and `@sync` macros to create separate threads for each string in the input vector. The `pig_latin_word` function is then defined to take a single word as an argument and return its pig latin equivalent. Note that the `@everywhere` macro is used to make these functions available on all processes created by `addprocs()`.\n  \nThis function returns a list of strings, where each string is a word in the original text transformed into its Pig Latin equivalent. \n\nPlease note: This solution might not work as expected if you have non-alphabetic characters (like punctuation or numbers) at the beginning or end of words, since these won't be moved to the end of the word when converted to Pig Latin. You may need to adjust this function according to your specific requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,348],"elapsed":3.138885994,"_type":"aimessage"}]
