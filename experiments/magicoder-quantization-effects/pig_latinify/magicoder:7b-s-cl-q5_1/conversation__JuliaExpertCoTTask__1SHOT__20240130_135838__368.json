Here is how you do it:\n\n```julia\nprintln(pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]))\n```\nNote: You should install Julia before running above code. Also, Pig Latin transformation translates English words into a derived language that follows the pattern where the first letter of each word is placed at the end of the word and then followed by “ay”. For example, \"apple\" becomes \"applaeY\", \"world\" becomes \"orldway\". \nThis script will print [\"elloHay\", \"appleAy\", \"strongOngray\", \"orldway\"] to the console.","status":200,"tokens":[0,360],"elapsed":3.216596062,"_type":"aimessage"}]
