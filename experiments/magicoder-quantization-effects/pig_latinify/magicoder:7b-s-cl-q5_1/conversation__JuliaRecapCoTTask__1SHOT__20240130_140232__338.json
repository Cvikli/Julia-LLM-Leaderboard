[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia code for your problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strs) \n    function pig_latin_helper(str) \n        words = split(str, ' ') # split string into words\n        return join([pig_latin_word(word) for word in words], \" \")\n    end\n    return [pig_latin_helper(s) for s in strs]\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_word(str::AbstractString) \n    if first(str) isupper\n        return uppercase(str[2:end]) * \"ay\" * (islower(first(str)) ? \"\" : first(str)) # capitalized word\n    elseif first(str) islower\n        return str * \"ay\"                   # uncapitalized word\n    else \n        return uppercase(first(str)) * \"ay\" # special characters at the beginning\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function takes a vector of strings as input. For each string in the vector, it splits the string into words and applies the `pig_latin_word` transformation to each word. The result is returned as a vector of transformed strings.\n\nThe `pig_latin_word` function translates a single word from English to Pig Latin. It checks if the first character of the word is uppercase or lowercase and applies the translation rule accordingly. \n\nIf you want to run it on separate threads for better performance, use Julia's multi-threading capabilities:\n```julia\nusing Distributed\naddprocs(2) # adds two new processes\n@everywhere using .pig_latinify\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strs::AbstractArray{<:AbstractString})\n    strs = split(reduce(*, strs), ' ') \n    @sync begin\n        for i in workers()\n            @async remotecall_fetch(pig_latinify, i, strs)\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this version of `pig_latinify`, the work is split among all available processes. The `@everywhere` macro ensures that the function `pig_latinify` and its helper functions are available on each worker process, and `remotecall_fetch` sends a remote call to each worker.","status":200,"tokens":[0,534],"elapsed":4.953679473,"_type":"aimessage"}]
