[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `map` function applies the `convert_to_pig_latin` function to each element of the input list (i.e., each string). \n\nThe `convert_to_pig_latin` function is a nested function that operates on single strings, transforming them into Pig Latin. This function splits the string into words using `\" \"`, then creates new words by moving the first character to the end and adding 'ay'. It concatenates all the new words back together with spaces in between.\n\nThis implementation assumes that words are separated by a single space, as is common in English language text. If other separators or multiple spaces might appear, the `split` function should be modified accordingly. \n\nNote: Before running this code, make sure Julia's Distributed package is installed. You can do this with the command `]add Distributed`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,434],"elapsed":3.523443683,"_type":"aimessage"}]
