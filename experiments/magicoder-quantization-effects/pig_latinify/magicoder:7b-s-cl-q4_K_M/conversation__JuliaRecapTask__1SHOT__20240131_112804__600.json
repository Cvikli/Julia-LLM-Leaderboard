[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `@sync begin ... end` construct is used to ensure that all the threads spawned by `@async` are joined before returning from `pig_latinify`.\n\nThe inner function `pig_latinify(s::AbstractString)` takes in a string and returns its pig latin translation. It splits the string into words, then for each word, it checks if the first letter is a vowel. If it is, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word. Otherwise, it moves the first character to the end of the word and adds \"ay\". Finally, it joins all the transformed words back together with spaces in between.\n\nThis code assumes that each string in the input vector contains only lowercase letters and spaces, and that there are no punctuation marks or uppercase letters in the strings. If these assumptions do not hold, additional error checking would be needed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,423],"elapsed":3.455343599,"_type":"aimessage"}]
