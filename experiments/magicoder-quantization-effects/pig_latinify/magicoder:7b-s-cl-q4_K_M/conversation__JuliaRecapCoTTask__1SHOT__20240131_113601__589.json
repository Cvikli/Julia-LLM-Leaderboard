[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Then, it defines the `pig_latinify` function inside that process and uses `@everywhere` to make sure that the function is defined on all processes.\n\nThe function splits each string into words, then checks whether the first letter of each word is a vowel or consonant. If it's a vowel, it appends \"ay\" to the end of the word and moves the rest of the word to the beginning. If it's a consonant, it moves that character to the end of the word and adds \"ay\". Finally, it joins all the words back together into strings.\n\nThe `@distributed` macro is used to apply the `pig_latinify` function to each element in parallel on the new process. The results are then combined using `vcat`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,446],"elapsed":3.673796665,"_type":"aimessage"}]
