[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia code that solves this problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    @sync begin\n        for word in words\n            @async println(pig_latin(word))\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word)\n    first = word[1]\n    rest = word[2:end] * \"ay\"\n    return \"$rest $first\"\nend\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `pig_latinify` that takes in an array of strings. Inside this function, it uses `@sync begin ... end` to create a new task for each string in the input list and then waits until all tasks are complete using `@async`. \n\nThe `pig_latin` function is defined to transform a single word into pig latin. It takes the first letter of the word, appends \"ay\", and then returns the result.\n\nYou can test this code with:\n```julia\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\n```\nThis will print out each pig latin translation on a new line.","status":200,"tokens":[0,261],"elapsed":3.153664717,"_type":"aimessage"}]
