This allows us to take advantage of the fact that Julia's `vcat` operation automatically distributes its work among multiple threads.\n- The `pig_latin` function translates a single string into pig latin. It uses regex to identify the first non-vowel characters and then appends \"ay\" to the end.","status":200,"tokens":[0,471],"elapsed":3.812120722,"_type":"aimessage"}]
