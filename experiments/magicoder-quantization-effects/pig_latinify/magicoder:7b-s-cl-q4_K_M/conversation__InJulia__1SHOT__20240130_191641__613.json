Inside, each string in the input array is transformed by a separate task (`@async println(pig_latinify(str))`). \n\nPlease note this code does not handle punctuation correctly. A complete solution would need to add additional logic to handle that.","status":200,"tokens":[0,341],"elapsed":2.751061624,"_type":"aimessage"}]
