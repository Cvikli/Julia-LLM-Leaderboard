Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you can solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    @sync begin\n        for str in strings\n            @async println(pig_latin(str))\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    first_letter = word[1]\n\n    if first_letter in vowels\n        return string(\"way\", word)\n    else\n        return string(word[2:end], \"ay\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis code defines a `pig_latinify` function that takes a vector of strings as input. Inside the function, it uses `@sync begin ... end` to ensure that all asynchronous tasks (i.e., each string transformation) are executed in parallel using threads. \n\nThe `pig_latin` function is then used within an anonymous async function (`@async`) for each string in the input vector. The result of this operation is printed out immediately, but you could easily modify it to return a new vector or store the results somewhere else if needed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,281],"elapsed":2.250599835,"_type":"aimessage"}]
