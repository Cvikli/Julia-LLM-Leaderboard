[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Each thread is an anonymous async function that prints the result of the pig latin transformation. The actual pig latin translation is done by the `pig_latinify(s::String)` function, which checks if the first letter or the second and third letters are vowels (for words starting with a vowel) or consonants (for words starting with a consonant). If it's a vowel, it appends \"way\" to the beginning; if it's a consonant followed by a vowel, it moves the first letter to the end and adds \"ay\"; otherwise, it moves the first two letters to the end and adds \"ay\".\n\nPlease replace `{{instructions}}` with the actual instructions you want to be considered in this task.","status":200,"tokens":[0,406],"elapsed":3.344091449,"_type":"aimessage"}]
