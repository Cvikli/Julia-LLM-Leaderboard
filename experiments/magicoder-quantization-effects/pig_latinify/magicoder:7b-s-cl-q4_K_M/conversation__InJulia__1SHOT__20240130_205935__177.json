It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can do this in Julia using the built-in Threads package:\n\n```julia\nusing Transformers\nimport Base: _pig_latinify\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    function _pig_latinify(word::AbstractString) \n        if isempty(word)\n            return \"\"\n        elseif length(word) <= 1 || startswith(word, vowel)\n            return word * \"ay\"\n        else\n            return word[2:end]*word[1]*\"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        words[i] = _pig_latinify(words[i])\n    end\n    return words\nend\n```\n\nIn this example, the pig_latinify function accepts a vector of strings and applies the _pig_latinify transformation to each string. The `_pig_latinify` function is a helper function that checks whether a word starts with a vowel or not. If it does, it simply appends \"ay\" at the end of the word; otherwise, it moves the first letter to the end and appends \"ay\".\n\nThe `Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)` line uses Julia's built-in threading capabilities to apply these transformations concurrently on separate threads.","status":200,"tokens":[103,316],"elapsed":16.905356276,"_type":"aimessage"}]
