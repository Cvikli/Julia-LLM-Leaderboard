The first function translates a single word into Pig Latin. The second function applies this translation to every word in the provided vector using multithreading.\n\nPlease note that you might need to install Transformers package by running `using Pkg; Pkg.add(\"Transformers\")` if it's not installed already.\n\nThis script assumes that the words are separated by spaces and punctuation is handled outside of this function, as it doesn't handle sentences with multiple words per line or special characters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,384],"elapsed":3.111084129,"_type":"aimessage"}]
