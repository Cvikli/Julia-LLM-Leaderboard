It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    @sync begin\n        for word in words\n            @async println(pig_latinify_word(word))\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_word(word::AbstractString)\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    rest = word[2:end] * \"ay\"\n    return \"$rest $first_letter\"\nend\n```\nThe function `pig_latinify` will call the inner function `pig_latinify_word` on each element of the input array in a separate thread. This is done using `@sync begin ... end` and `@async`. The `pig_latinify_word` function translates a word into Pig Latin by appending \"ay\" to the rest of the word and placing the first letter at the end.\n\nYou can test this function with your example like so:\n```julia\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,260],"elapsed":2.074870811,"_type":"aimessage"}]
