The transformation for each word is done by the helper function `translate`.\n\nThe `startswith` function checks if a string starts with a given character (used to determine whether the first letter of a word should be moved to the end or not).\n\nThe `vowel` function checks if a character is a vowel.\n\nThe `@spawn` macro from the Threads package is used to start a new thread for each string in the input vector, and then the `fetch` function is used to wait until all threads have finished and return their results.","status":200,"tokens":[0,363],"elapsed":2.937437307,"_type":"aimessage"}]
