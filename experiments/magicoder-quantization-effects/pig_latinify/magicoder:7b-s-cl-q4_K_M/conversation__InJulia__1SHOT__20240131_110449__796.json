It creates a new worker for each core if they are not already running, and then assigns each string to be converted to that worker. The result is collected back on the calling thread once all conversions have been completed.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that you have at least as many strings as available cores. If you have fewer strings than cores, some of the workers will remain idle.","status":200,"tokens":[0,409],"elapsed":3.319180497,"_type":"aimessage"}]
