The `pig_latinify_vector` function is also defined, which takes a vector of words and applies the pig latin transformation to each one using multiple threads.\n3. For each word in the input vector, we create a task using `@everywhere` macro that will call `local_pig_latinify` on this word. \n4. The results are fetched using `Distributed.fetchall(tasks)` function to retrieve the results from these tasks.\n\nThe `@everywhere` is used to define a function that can be run on each worker process in the cluster.","status":200,"tokens":[0,443],"elapsed":3.640935935,"_type":"aimessage"}]
