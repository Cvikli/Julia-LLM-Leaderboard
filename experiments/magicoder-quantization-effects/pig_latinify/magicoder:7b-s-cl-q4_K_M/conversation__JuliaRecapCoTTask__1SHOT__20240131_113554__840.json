[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It checks if the first letter of the word is not a vowel and moves it to the end with 'ay'. If it's a vowel, it just adds 'ay' at the end.\n\nThen, it defines another helper function `translate_sentence` that takes in a vector of words and translates each one into pig latin using the `translate_word` function.\n\nFinally, it uses multithreading to translate each word in the input vector into pig latin by splitting the sentence into individual words, translating them, and then joining them back together. \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that words are separated by spaces. If they're separated by other characters (like commas or periods), you would need to modify the `split` function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[406,434],"elapsed":8.252028496,"_type":"aimessage"}]
