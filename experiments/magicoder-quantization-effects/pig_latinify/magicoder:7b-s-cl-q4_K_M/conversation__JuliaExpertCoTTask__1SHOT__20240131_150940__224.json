Each thread calls the `pig_latin_word` function on its corresponding word, and stores the result in the results array. The `pig_latin_word` function translates a single word into pig latin.\n\nWhen you run `pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])`, it will return the vector `[\"ellohay\", \"appleyay\", \"rongstray\", \"orldway\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,366],"elapsed":2.936037172,"_type":"aimessage"}]
