It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can solve this problem in Julia programming language:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\nimport Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    @sync begin\n        for string in strings\n            @async begin\n                print(translate_string(string))\n            end\n        end\nend\n\nfunction translate_string(word)\n    words = split(word, ' ')\n    piglatin_words = map(words) do word\n        if islowercase(first(word))\n            join([word[2:end], word[1], \"ay\"], \"\")\n        elseif isuppercase(first(word))\n            join([word[2:end], word[1], \"AY\"], \"\")\n        end\n    end\n    return piglatin_words\nend\n```\nIn this code, we are using the `@sync` macro to ensure that all async tasks started within the block get executed in order. We use `@async` inside a loop to spawn new threads for each word in the string vector. \n\nThe `translate_string` function takes a single string and turns it into pig latin. It splits the string into words, then maps over these words to apply the transformation rule (move first letter to end of the word followed by \"ay\"). If the first letter is uppercase, the same is done but with an uppercase 'AY' at the end.\n\nPlease note that in real-world usage, you would probably want to make this code more robust and handle other cases (e.g., punctuation marks, multiple spaces between words).","status":200,"tokens":[0,360],"elapsed":2.927362701,"_type":"aimessage"}]
