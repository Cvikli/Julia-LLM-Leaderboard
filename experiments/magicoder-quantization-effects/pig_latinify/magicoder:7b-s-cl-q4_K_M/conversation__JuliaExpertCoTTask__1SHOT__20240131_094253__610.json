It uses `@sync begin ... @spawn ... end` to run the loop in parallel on different threads. The `pig_latin` function is used within this loop to convert each word into pig latin.\n\nWhen you call `pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])`, it will print out:\n```julia\n\"ellohay\"\n\"appleyay\"\n\"rongstray\"\n\"orldway\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,289],"elapsed":3.256168696,"_type":"aimessage"}]
