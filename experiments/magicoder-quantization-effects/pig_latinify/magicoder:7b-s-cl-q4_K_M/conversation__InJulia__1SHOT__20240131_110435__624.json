Otherwise, move the first letter to the end and add \"ay\".\n    if occursin(r\"^[aeiou]\", word)\n        return string(word * \"way\")\n    else\n        return string(word[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis `pig_latinify` function uses the `@sync begin ... @async ... end` syntax to create a new task for each word in the input vector and then wait until all tasks are finished. \n\nThe `pig_latin` function applies the Pig Latin rules to a single word. It checks if the first letter of the word is a vowel using regular expressions, and if so it appends \"way\" to the end of the word. Otherwise, it moves the first letter to the end and adds \"ay\".\n\nYou can call `pig_latinify` function with a vector of strings as follows:\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"orange\", \"banana\"]\npig_latinify(words)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,373],"elapsed":2.974915882,"_type":"aimessage"}]
