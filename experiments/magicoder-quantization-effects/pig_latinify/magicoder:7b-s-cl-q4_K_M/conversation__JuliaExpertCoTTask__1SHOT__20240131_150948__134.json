It uses `pmap` function from Distributed module which applies a function to each element of an array in parallel. The map function is used to apply the translation on each word. \n\nPlease note that you should have Julia installed in your environment, and you should run this code within Julia REPL or Jupyter notebook with Julia kernel.","status":200,"tokens":[0,384],"elapsed":3.089176483,"_type":"aimessage"}]
