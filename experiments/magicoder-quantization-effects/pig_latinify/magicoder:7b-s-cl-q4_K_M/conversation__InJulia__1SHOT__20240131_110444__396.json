The `println(string * \"ay\")` line is responsible for the actual transformation, where we concatenate `\"ay\"` with each string and print it out.\n\nPlease note that this script will not return anything because the transformations are performed asynchronously in separate threads. If you want to collect the transformed strings into a result vector or some other data structure, you would need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,244],"elapsed":1.934648833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
