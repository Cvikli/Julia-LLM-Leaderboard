The `@threads` macro is used to create a new thread for each iteration, allowing parallel processing. \n\nThe Pig Latin transformation works by moving the first letter to the end of the word and appending \"ay\". If the first letter is uppercase, it's also moved to the end with an additional \"Ay\" at the end.","status":200,"tokens":[0,284],"elapsed":2.259745308,"_type":"aimessage"}]
