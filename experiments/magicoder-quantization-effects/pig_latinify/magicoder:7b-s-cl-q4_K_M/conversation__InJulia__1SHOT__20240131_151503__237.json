The `@threads` macro ensures that the operation is performed in parallel on different threads, making it faster for large inputs.\n\nPlease note that you need to install Transducers package by running `Pkg.add(\"Transducers\")` in your Julia console before using this code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,312],"elapsed":2.480036721,"_type":"aimessage"}]
