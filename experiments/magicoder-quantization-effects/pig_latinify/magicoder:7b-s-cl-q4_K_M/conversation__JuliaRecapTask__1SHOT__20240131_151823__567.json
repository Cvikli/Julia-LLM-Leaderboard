[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed, Transformers\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    @sync begin\n        for string in strings\n            @async println(pig_latinify_single(string))\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_single(s::AbstractString)\n    words = split(s, \" \")\n    pig_latin_words = map(words) do word\n        if startswith(word, vowel)\n            string(\"$(word[2:end])ay\")\n        else\n            string(\"$(word[2:end])$(word[1])ay\")\n        end\n    end\n    join(pig_latin_words, \" \")\nend\n```\nIn this code, the `pig_latinify` function uses `@async` and `@sync` to create a separate thread for each string in the input vector. The `pig_latinify_single` function is then used to transform each string into pig latin. \n\nPlease note that in real-world scenarios, it's better to use `Threads.@threads` instead of `@async` and `@sync`. The difference between the two is that `@threads` automatically creates a new thread for every loop iteration (which can be slower), whereas `@async` creates tasks which are scheduled onto threads as they become available.\n\nAlso, this code assumes that \"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", and \"u\" are vowels, and all other characters are consonants. You may want to adjust the function based on your specific requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,373],"elapsed":3.0613284,"_type":"aimessage"}]
