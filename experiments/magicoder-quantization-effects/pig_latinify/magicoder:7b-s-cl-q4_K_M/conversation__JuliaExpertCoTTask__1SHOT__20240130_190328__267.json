Then, we define the main function `pig_latinify`, which uses threads from Julia's Threads package to convert each string in the vector in parallel. The result is printed out at the end. \n\nWhen you run this code with the given input [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"], it should output \"ellohay applayay rognsray\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,305],"elapsed":2.534930145,"_type":"aimessage"}]
