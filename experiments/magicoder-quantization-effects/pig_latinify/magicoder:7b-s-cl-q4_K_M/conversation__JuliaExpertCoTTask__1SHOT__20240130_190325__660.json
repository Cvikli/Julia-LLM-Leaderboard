Then it waits for all tasks to complete and stores their results in another array. Because this operation is computationally heavy, it's done concurrently using Julia's `@async` macro and `fetch` function from Distributed package.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that you have the Distributed package installed (which is usually the case if you're programming in Julia). If not, install it with Pkg.add(\"Distributed\").","status":200,"tokens":[0,382],"elapsed":3.187967308,"_type":"aimessage"}]
