Then, it uses `@threads` from Julia's `Threads` package to run each iteration of the loop on a separate thread. The result is printed out for each word in the input vector.\n\nYou can call this function with your example data like so:\n```julia\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,204],"elapsed":3.013642838,"_type":"aimessage"}]
