This is not a traditional \"pig latin translation\", but rather just an example of how you could print out transformed strings in parallel. Please note that the real Pig Latin translations would be more complex as they involve shifting the first letter(s) to the end, possibly adding \"ay\" or moving it before the rest of the word. \n\nHere's an example of a traditional Pig Latin translation:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words) \n    for word in words \n        @async println(word[end]*word[1:(end-1)]*\"ay\")\n    end\nend\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,291],"elapsed":2.374395646,"_type":"aimessage"}]
