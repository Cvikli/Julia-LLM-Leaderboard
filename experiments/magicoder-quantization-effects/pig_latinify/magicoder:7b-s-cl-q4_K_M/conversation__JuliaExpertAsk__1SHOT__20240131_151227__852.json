The `@distributed` macro is used to run each string transformation in its own thread. The results are collected into an array using channels.\n\nPlease note that this is a very basic implementation, and it might not cover all possible edge cases of pig latin rules. For example, it doesn't handle punctuation marks or capitalization.","status":200,"tokens":[0,453],"elapsed":3.65079614,"_type":"aimessage"}]
