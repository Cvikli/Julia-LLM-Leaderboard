It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could write the function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    result = Vector{String}()\n    @threads for word in words\n        push!(result, pig_latinify(word))\n    end\n    return result\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(word::String)\n    vowels = [\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"]\n    if word[1] in vowels\n        return string(word, \"way\")\n    else\n        return string(word[2:end], word[1], \"ay\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, we define two functions. The first one `pig_latinify` accepts a vector of strings and returns a new vector with the transformed words. It uses `@threads` macro to run each iteration in a separate thread.\n\nThe second function `pig_latinify(word::String)` is responsible for transforming a single word into pig latin. If the first letter of the word is a vowel, it appends \"way\" at the end otherwise it moves the first letter to the end and adds \"ay\". \n\nPlease note that this code doesn't handle words with multiple spaces or punctuation properly. You would need to add extra logic to handle these cases if you want your function to work correctly in all situations.","status":200,"tokens":[0,329],"elapsed":2.621829873,"_type":"aimessage"}]
