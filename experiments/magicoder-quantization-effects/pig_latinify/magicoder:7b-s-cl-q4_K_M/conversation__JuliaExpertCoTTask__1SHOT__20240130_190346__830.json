Then it uses `Threads.ThreadPool` to run the translation of each word in parallel, which can greatly speed up processing time when dealing with large amounts of data. After all threads have finished, it waits for them and fetches the result using `fetch`.\n\nYou would call this function as follows:\n```julia\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,480],"elapsed":3.948758279,"_type":"aimessage"}]
