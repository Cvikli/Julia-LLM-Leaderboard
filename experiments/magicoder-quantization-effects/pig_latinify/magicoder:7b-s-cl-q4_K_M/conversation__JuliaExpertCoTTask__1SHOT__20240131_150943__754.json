It takes the first letter of the string, moves it to the end with \"ay\" and returns the new string. \n- `@threads for i in eachindex(words)` creates a loop that iterates over each index in `words`, but runs each iteration on a separate thread. This allows us to process multiple words concurrently, which can significantly speed up this operation.\n- Finally, we return the transformed list of words.","status":200,"tokens":[0,248],"elapsed":1.980109877,"_type":"aimessage"}]
