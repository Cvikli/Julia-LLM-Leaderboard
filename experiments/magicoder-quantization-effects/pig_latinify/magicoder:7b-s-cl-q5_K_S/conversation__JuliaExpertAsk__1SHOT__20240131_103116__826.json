The `pig_latinify` function uses `@sync @async` to run each word in the input vector of strings on a separate thread. The `pig_latin` function takes a string, splits it into words, transforms each word into pig latin (moving the first letter to the end and appending \"ay\"), then joins the transformed words back together into a single string.\n\nPlease note that this script assumes that the input vector of strings is not too large because Julia's multithreading capabilities are limited. If you have a very large number of strings, you might need to use a different approach (like using Julia's parallel computing features or breaking up the work into smaller chunks).","status":200,"tokens":[0,415],"elapsed":3.546509398,"_type":"aimessage"}]
