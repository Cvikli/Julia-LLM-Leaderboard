[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Inside the function, we use `@sync begin ... @async end` to create a new task for each word in the input vector and run them concurrently using multiple threads. The `pig_latin` function is used within this process to transform each word into pig latin.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function checks whether the first letter of the word is a vowel or not. If it's a vowel, it appends \"way\" at the end of the word and returns it. Otherwise, it takes all characters after the first one and adds them before the first character, followed by \"ay\".\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\npig_latinify(words)\n```\nThis will print out each word transformed into pig latin on a new line.","status":200,"tokens":[0,383],"elapsed":3.326676847,"_type":"aimessage"}]
