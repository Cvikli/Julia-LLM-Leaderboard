It then spawns a separate thread for each word in the input string, transforming it to pig latin and storing the result in the corresponding position in the output vector. The `@sync begin ... end` construct ensures that the function doesn't return before all threads have finished.\n\nThe `pig_latin_transform` function is a helper function that performs the actual transformation of each word to pig latin. It splits the string into words, transforms each one, and then joins them back together into a sentence. If the first character of the word is uppercase or lowercase, it adds \"ay\" at the end. Otherwise, it moves the first character to the end and adds \"ay\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,457],"elapsed":3.885833821,"_type":"aimessage"}]
