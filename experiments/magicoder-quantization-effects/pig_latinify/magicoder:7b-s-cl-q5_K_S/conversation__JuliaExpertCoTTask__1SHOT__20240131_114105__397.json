It uses the `@threads` macro from Julia's Base.Threads module to create multiple threads for processing each string in parallel. \n\nThe `pig_latin_word` function is used inside the loop to convert each word into pig latin. If the word has more than one letter, it takes the first letter and moves it to the end of the word (followed by \"ay\"), otherwise it just appends \"ay\" to the word.\n\nYou can test this code with: \n```julia\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,306],"elapsed":2.603288807,"_type":"aimessage"}]
