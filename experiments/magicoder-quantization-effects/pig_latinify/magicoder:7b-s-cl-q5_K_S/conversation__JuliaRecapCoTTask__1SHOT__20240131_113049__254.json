[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Each task transforms its corresponding word into pig latin and sends it through a channel. The main thread then iterates over this channel, collecting all transformed words into a single vector.\n\nThe `pig_latin_transform` function takes a string as an argument and returns the pig latin version of that string. It first checks if the word starts with a vowel, in which case it appends \"way\" to the end; otherwise, it moves all letters after the first one to the front and adds \"ay\".\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that words are only made up of alphabetic characters and does not handle punctuation or other special characters. You would need to add additional logic to handle these cases if necessary.","status":200,"tokens":[0,505],"elapsed":4.407520632,"_type":"aimessage"}]
