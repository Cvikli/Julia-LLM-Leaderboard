[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

It uses `@sync begin ... end` to ensure all threads are properly synchronized. \n\nEach word in the input vector is then processed by a separate thread using `@async`. The `pig_latin` function is applied to each word, which replaces the first letter with \"ay\" and moves it to the end of the string.\n\nYou can run this code on your Julia environment and call `pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])`. It will print out the pig latin versions of each word in separate lines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,272],"elapsed":2.45024239,"_type":"aimessage"}]
