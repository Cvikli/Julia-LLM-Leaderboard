X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

This function will take a vector of strings as input and return a new vector where each string has been transformed into pig latin. \n\nPig Latin is a game of alterations played on words in English-language spoken languages, where each word beginning with a consonant sounds the same but is appended with \"ay\". If the word begins with a vowel sound, we move that vowel to the end of the word and add \"ay\" at the end.\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    # Pig Latin rules: \n    # If a word starts with a vowel, append 'way' at the end.\n    # If a word starts with a consonant, move it to the end and add 'ay'.\n    \n    pig_latin = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    for (i, word) in enumerate(words)\n        vowel_check = [startswith(word, \"a\"), startswith(word, \"e\"), \n                        startswith(word, \"i\"), startswith(word, \"o\"), startswith(word, \"u\")]\n        \n        if all(!,vowel_check) # All consonants at the start of word\n            pig_latin[i] = join([word[2:end], word[1],\"ay\"])\n        elseif any(vowel_check)  # At least one vowel at the start of word\n            pig_latin[i] = join([filter(!,vowel_check), word[findfirst(vowel_check):end], \"ay\",])\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return pig_latin\nend\n```\n\nTo make this operation run on separate threads for each word in the input array, we can use Julia's multithreading capabilities. Here is an example of how you could do that:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n@everywhere function pig_latinify(word)\n    vowel_check = [startswith(word, \"a\"), startswith(word, \"e\"), \n                    startswith(word, \"i\"), startswith(word, \"o\"), startswith(word, \"u\")]\n    \n    if all(!,vowel_check) # All consonants at the start of word\n        return join([word[2:end], word[1],\"ay\"])\n    elseif any(vowel_check)  # At least one vowel at the start of word\n        return join([filter(!,vowel_check), word[findfirst(vowel_check):end], \"ay\",])\n    end\nend\n\nwords = [\"apple\",\"banana\",\"cherry\"]\npiglatinwords = pmap(pig_latinify, words)\n```\nIn the above code, `@everywhere` macro makes `pig_latinify` available for all workers. We are using `pmap` which is a parallel version of map and applies `pig_latinify` on each element in the input array in parallel.","status":200,"tokens":[0,724],"elapsed":6.493234315,"_type":"aimessage"}]
