The `pig_latin` helper function is responsible for the actual transformation of each word into pig latin.\n\nTo use this code, you can simply call `pig_latinify` with a list of strings:\n\n```python\nwords = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\nprint(pig_latinify(words))  # Outputs: ['appway', 'anbayway', 'errychay']\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,316],"elapsed":2.677859543,"_type":"aimessage"}]
