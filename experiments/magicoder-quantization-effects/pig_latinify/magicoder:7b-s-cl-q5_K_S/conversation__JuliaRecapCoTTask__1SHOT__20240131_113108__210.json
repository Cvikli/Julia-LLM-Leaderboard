[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The transformation is done by splitting the string into words, transforming each word to Pig Latin, and then joining them back together.\n\nThe transformation to Pig Latin is done using the `pig_latinify_word` function, which checks if the first letter of a word is a vowel or not. If it's a vowel, it adds \"way\" at the end; otherwise, it moves the first letter to the end and appends \"ay\".\n\nThe transformation is done in parallel by using Julia's `@spawn` macro inside a `Threads.@sync` block, which ensures that all transformations are completed before the results are printed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,530],"elapsed":4.633170075,"_type":"aimessage"}]
