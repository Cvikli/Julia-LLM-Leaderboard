The `pig_latin` function splits each string into words, then applies the `pig_latin_word` function to each word.\n\nPlease note that if you want to use this code, you need to have Julia installed on your machine and also use a compatible version of Julia (1.6 or above). \n\nTo run this script in parallel mode, you can start Julia with the `--puserver` option: `julia --puserver`. Then connect to it from another terminal with `julia --connect`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,370],"elapsed":3.146004324,"_type":"aimessage"}]
