This uses the first letter of the word as a flag, if it's a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), we append \"ay\" otherwise we prepend the rest of the word followed by the first character then \"ay\".\n- The main `pig_latinify` function uses `@distributed` macro to run this helper function on each element in the input array (vector) in parallel. This effectively transforms all strings in the vector to pig latin simultaneously.\n\nYou can call this like so:\n```julia\nprintln.(pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]))\n```\nThis will print out `elloHay yppaay enslurgray oway`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,393],"elapsed":3.390807432,"_type":"aimessage"}]
