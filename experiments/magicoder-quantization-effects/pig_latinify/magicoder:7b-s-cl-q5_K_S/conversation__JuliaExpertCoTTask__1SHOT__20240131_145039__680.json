It also defines another function that applies this to a vector of strings by distributing the work across multiple threads. The `@spawnat myid() pig_latinify(str)` line creates a new task on the current worker to perform the translation, and `@sync` waits for all these tasks to complete before returning the results.","status":200,"tokens":[0,381],"elapsed":3.260159035,"_type":"aimessage"}]
