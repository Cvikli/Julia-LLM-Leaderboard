[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution in Julia:\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads # for multithreading\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    result = Vector{String}()\n    @threads for word in words\n        push!(result, pig_latin_word(word))\n    end\n    return result\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_word(word::String)\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    if islowercase(first_letter) # check if the word starts with a lower case letter\n        return string(word[2:end], first_letter, \"ay\") # move all letters to end and add \"ay\" at start\n    else\n        return string(word[2:end], first_letter * \"ay\") # move all letters to end and add \"ay\" at start with capital letter\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function `pig_latinify` takes a vector of strings as input. It uses the `@threads` macro from Julia's Base package for multithreading, which allows it to run on multiple cores simultaneously. \n\nFor each word in the input vector, it calls the helper function `pig_latin_word`. This function checks if the first letter of a word is lowercase or uppercase and applies the pig latin transformation accordingly. It then returns the transformed word as a string.\n\nThe `@threads` macro splits the loop into chunks that can be executed simultaneously on different threads, which can significantly speed up execution time for large inputs.","status":200,"tokens":[0,345],"elapsed":3.139902084,"_type":"aimessage"}]
