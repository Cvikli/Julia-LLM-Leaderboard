The latter operates on a single word in a sentence. It takes the first character of the word as the initial vowel, then moves all the letters after it to the end. If the word starts with an upper-case letter (as is common in English), it converts that letter to lower case before adding \"AY\". If the word starts with a digit, it just adds that digit at the end.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_single` function transforms each string in the input vector using these rules and runs on its own thread. Each result is collected into a new array.\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes the first letter of each word can be used to determine whether it's an uppercase or lowercase vowel, digits are not considered as vowels for our purpose here. Also, please remember that \"ay\" should only be added after consonant sounds, and no consonants should be moved before a 'qu'.","status":200,"tokens":[0,508],"elapsed":4.423039552,"_type":"aimessage"}]
