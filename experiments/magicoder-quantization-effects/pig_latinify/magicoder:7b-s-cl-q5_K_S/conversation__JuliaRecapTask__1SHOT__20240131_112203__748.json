[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed, Transducers\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    @sync begin\n        for word in words\n            @async println(pig_latin(word))\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word::AbstractString)\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    rest_of_word = word[2:end] * \"ay\"\n    return \"$rest_of_word $first_letter\"\nend\n```\n\nIn this solution, we use the `@sync` macro to ensure that all threads start at the same time. For each word in `words`, a new thread is started using `@async`. The `pig_latin` function is then called on each word and its result is printed out. \n\nThe `pig_latin` function takes an input string, extracts the first letter of the string, appends \"ay\" to the rest of the string, and returns this new string.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that you have Julia installed on your system and that you are familiar with its syntax and standard libraries.","status":200,"tokens":[0,272],"elapsed":2.465907147,"_type":"aimessage"}]
