It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you could implement this in Julia:\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    return [pig_latin(word) for word in words]\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word)\n    vowel_list = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    first_letter = word[1]  # grab the first letter of the string\n    \n    if islowercase(first_letter) && !(first_letter in vowel_list)  \n        return string(word[2:end], first_letter, \"ay\")\n    elseif isuppercase(first_letter) \n        return uppercase(string(word[2:end], first_letter, \"ay\"))\n    else\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\"] # sample input\nThreads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)\n    words[i] = pig_latinify([words[i]])\nend\n```\nThe `pig_latinify` function is a wrapper around the main `pig_latin` function. It takes a list of strings, applies the `pig_latin` function to each one in parallel using `@threads`, and returns the resulting list of transformed words.\n\nIn the `pig_latin` function, we first check if the first letter is a lowercase vowel, then return it followed by \"ay\". If it's an uppercase letter, convert the rest to lowercase and do the same. Otherwise, just append \"ay\" to the end of the word.\n\nThis should work as expected but be aware that strings are immutable in Julia so we need to use `replace!` if we want to modify the original vector. Also, this script will not run properly on a REPL as it would block waiting for all threads to complete before returning control to the user. You'd have to put this into a standalone .jl file or run in an interactive or debugging environment like Juno or VS Code with the Julia language server enabled.","status":200,"tokens":[0,475],"elapsed":4.159305763,"_type":"aimessage"}]
