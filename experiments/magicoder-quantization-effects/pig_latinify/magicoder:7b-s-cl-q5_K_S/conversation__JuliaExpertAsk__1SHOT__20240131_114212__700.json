It then uses `@sync begin ... end` to create a new task for each string in the array and run them concurrently using `@async`. The `pig_latin` function is used within these tasks to convert each word into Pig Latin.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you are running Julia with multiple threads enabled (using `--threads=N` command line option or `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` environment variable). If not, the `@async` macro will run on a single thread and won't actually create any parallelism.","status":200,"tokens":[0,409],"elapsed":3.481335292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
