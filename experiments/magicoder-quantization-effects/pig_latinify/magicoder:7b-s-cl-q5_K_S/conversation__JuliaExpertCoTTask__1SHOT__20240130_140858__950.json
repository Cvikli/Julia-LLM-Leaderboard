Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can write the `pig_latinify` function using Julia:\n\n```julia\nimport Base.:(+)\n\n@inline function pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(strings))\n    Threads.@threads for (i, str) in enumerate(strings)\n        word_list = split(str, ' ')  # Split string into list of words\n        piglatin_word_list = [piglatinify(word) for word in word_list]  # Transform each word to Pig Latin\n        results[i] = join(piglatin_word_list, ' ')  # Join words back into a string\n    end\n    return results\nend\n\n@inline function piglatinify(word::String)\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    if islowercase(first_letter)\n        pig_latin_form = lowercase(word[2:end]) * uppercase(first_letter) * \"ay\"  # Transforms to Pig Latin\n    elseif isuppercase(first_letter)\n        pig_latin_form = word[2:end] * first_letter * \"AY\"  # Transforms to Pig Latin\n    end\n    return pig_latin_form\nend\n```\n\nYou can then call the function with the given data like so:\n\n```julia\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\n```\nThe `pig_latinify` function first splits each string into a vector of words, converts each word to Pig Latin by appending the first letter to the end with \"ay\" and moving any remaining letters in the word, then joins these words back together. This operation is done on each string (word) concurrently using multiple threads for efficiency.","status":200,"tokens":[0,435],"elapsed":3.765163742,"_type":"aimessage"}]
