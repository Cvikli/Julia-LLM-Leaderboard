It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the code for your request:\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    function translate(word)\n        if length(word) > 0 && word[1] in vowels\n            return string(word, \"ay\")\n        else\n            return string(word[2:end], word[1], \"ay\")\n        end\n    end\n    \n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    Threads.@threads for word in words\n        println(translate(lowercase(word)))\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function uses a helper function `translate` to convert each string into pig latin. The main loop is wrapped with `@threads` macro so that it runs on separate threads. \n\nPlease note, the `Threads.@threads for word in words` syntax is equivalent to:\n\n- `for word in words`\n- `Threads.@spawn translate(lowercase(word))`\n\nThis means each string will be processed in a separate thread and the result printed out. If you want to return these piglatin strings, you can modify the function as follows: \n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    Threads.@threads for word in words\n        push!(result, translate(lowercase(word)))\n    end\n    return result\nend\n``` \nPlease make sure to initialize `result` before the loop.","status":200,"tokens":[0,352],"elapsed":2.984987031,"_type":"aimessage"}]
