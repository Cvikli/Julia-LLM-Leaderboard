It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could write this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n\n    # Define a worker function to apply on each word separately\n    @threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        result[i] = pig_latin_word(words[i])\n    end\n    return result\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_word(word)\n    # Define the Pig Latin transformation rule\n    vowelindices = findall(\"aeiou\", word)\n    if length(vowelindices) == 0 || vowelindices[1] == 1 # If no vowels or first letter is a vowel, add \"ay\" to end of the word\n        return string(word * \"ay\")\n    elseif length(vowelindices) > 1 && vowelindices[end] == length(word)-1 # If last letter is a vowel and there are more than one, move whole word after first consonant to end and add \"ay\" at the start of the moved part\n        return string(word[vowelindices[1]:end]*\"ay\", word[1:vowelindices[1]])\n    else # If last letter is not a vowel, move whole word after first consonant to end and add \"ay\" at the start of the moved part\n        return string(word[vowelindices[1]:end]*\"ay\", word[1:vowelindices[1]])\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a vector of words as input, creates an empty result array of the same length, and then iterates over each word in the input, applying the `pig_latin_word` transformation to it. The `@threads` macro is used to allow parallel processing for each word separately on different threads. The transformed words are stored back into the result array, which is returned as output.\n\nThis function assumes that a vowel is any of \"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", or \"u\" and converts words according to Pig Latin rules:\n\n1. If no vowels are present in word (like \"thwmp\"), it adds \"ay\" at the end of the word (like \"thwmpay\").\n2. If first letter is a vowel, it simply adds \"ay\" at the end of the word (like \"appleay\", \"orangeay\", etc.).\n3. If last letter is a vowel and there are more than one, moves whole word after first consonant to end and add \"ay\" at the start of moved part (like \"schwalpay\", \"smalpay\", etc.). \n4. If last letter is not a vowel, moves whole word after first consonant to end and add \"ay\" at the start of the moved part (like \"straypay\", \"strumay\", etc.).","status":200,"tokens":[0,660],"elapsed":5.797994464,"_type":"aimessage"}]
