Then, we define a function `pig_latinify` that iterates over each word in the input array using `@async` tasks for parallel execution.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function is used to transform a single word into pig latin. It takes the first letter of the word and appends it at the end, then adds \"ay\". \n\nFinally, we call `pig_latinify` with an array of words, and print each transformed word on a new line.","status":200,"tokens":[0,290],"elapsed":2.479584214,"_type":"aimessage"}]
