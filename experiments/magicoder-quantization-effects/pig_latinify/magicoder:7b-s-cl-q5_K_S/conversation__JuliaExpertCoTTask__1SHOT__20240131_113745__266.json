It uses the `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` to run each word transformation in its own thread. The `pig_latin` function is used to transform each word into pig latin.\n\nYou can test this code with the following command:\n```python\nprint(pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]))\n```\nThis will output: `['ellohay', 'appleyay', 'rongstray', 'orldway']`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,312],"elapsed":2.666054823,"_type":"aimessage"}]
