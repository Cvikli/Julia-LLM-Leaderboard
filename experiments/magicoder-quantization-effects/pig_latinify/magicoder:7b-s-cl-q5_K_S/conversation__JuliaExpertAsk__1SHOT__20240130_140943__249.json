The function checks if the first letter of the word is a vowel or not and applies different transformations accordingly. \n\nThe function `threaded_pig_latinify` creates threads for each word in the input vector, calling `pig_latinify` on them simultaneously using multithreading. Each thread writes its result to stdout.","status":200,"tokens":[0,325],"elapsed":2.807421774,"_type":"aimessage"}]
