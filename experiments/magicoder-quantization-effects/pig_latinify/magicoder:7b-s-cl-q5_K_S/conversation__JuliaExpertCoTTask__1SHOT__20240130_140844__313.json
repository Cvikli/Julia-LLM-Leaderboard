It checks if the first character is upper or lower case and appends \"ay\" accordingly to create pig latin words. The transformed words are stored in an array, which is returned at the end.\n\nYou can test it with this code:\n```julia\nprintln(pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]))\n# Outputs: [\"ellohay\", \"appleyay\", \"rongstray\", \"orldway\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[230,302],"elapsed":5.764465072,"_type":"aimessage"}]
