[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses `@sync begin ... end` and `@async println(...)` to create new threads for each word in the input vector. The `pig_latin` function does most of the work, transforming a single word into its pig Latin equivalent.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function starts by checking if the word is empty or contains non-alphabetic characters. If it doesn't, it then checks for the first vowel in the word (ignoring any consonants at the start of the word). It uses this to split the word into two parts: everything before and including the first vowel, and everything after. The latter is moved to the end of the string with a suffix of \"ay\".\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes words are separated by spaces. If you have punctuation attached to words, you might need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,454],"elapsed":3.967641323,"_type":"aimessage"}]
