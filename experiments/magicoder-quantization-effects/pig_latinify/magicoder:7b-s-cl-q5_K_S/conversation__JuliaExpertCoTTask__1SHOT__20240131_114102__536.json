Each word is translated in a separate thread using `@async`. The `pig_latinify_word` function takes a word and returns it as pig latin.\n\nYou can test this code with the following command:\n\n```julia\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\n```\n\nThis will print out:\n\n```\nellohay appleyay onglestrongway orldway\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,254],"elapsed":2.23980419,"_type":"aimessage"}]
