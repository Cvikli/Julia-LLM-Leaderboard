It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    @sync begin\n        for word in words\n            @async begin\n                println(\"$(word[end-1:end])$(word[1:end-1])ay\")\n            end\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `@sync` macro to ensure that all of the threads are synchronized. For each word in the input vector, it creates a new thread using the `@async` macro and then prints out the pig latin version of the word. The `println` function is used here because we don't actually need to return anything from this function; we just want to print out the transformed words.\n\nPlease note that this code does not handle punctuation or capitalization. You may wish to add additional functionality to handle these cases if necessary.","status":200,"tokens":[103,205],"elapsed":7.174949609,"_type":"aimessage"}]
