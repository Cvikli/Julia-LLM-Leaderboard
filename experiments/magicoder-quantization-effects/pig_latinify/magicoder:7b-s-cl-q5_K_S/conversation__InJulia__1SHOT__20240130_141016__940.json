It breaks the process into separate threads. This will be faster for larger vectors of strings due to parallel processing.\n\nNote: The `is_vowel` function is not efficient because it checks each character individually. You could optimize this by creating a dictionary of vowels or using Unicode properties in Julia, but this would make the code more complex. Also, Pig Latin rules can vary slightly depending on context, and this implementation may not strictly follow all possible variations.","status":200,"tokens":[0,493],"elapsed":4.284744487,"_type":"aimessage"}]
