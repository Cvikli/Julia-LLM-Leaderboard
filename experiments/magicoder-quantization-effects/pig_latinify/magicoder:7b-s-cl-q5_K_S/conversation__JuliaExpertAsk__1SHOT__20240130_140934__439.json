Each thread calls the `transform_to_piglatin` function on its assigned string. The `transform_to_piglatin` function then converts an input word to pig latin by appending \"ay\" at the end of words that start with vowels, or shifting all letters before a vowel to the end and adding \"ay\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,409],"elapsed":3.51986203,"_type":"aimessage"}]
