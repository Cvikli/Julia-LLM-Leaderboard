The `pig_latin` function splits a string into words and applies the pig latin transformation to each word.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that you have Julia installed with the Distributed and Base.Threads packages, as well as a working Julia environment with access to internet for downloading these packages.","status":200,"tokens":[0,319],"elapsed":2.732852792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
