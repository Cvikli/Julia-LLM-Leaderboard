[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple example of how you can solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    # Create an empty array to store the transformed words\n    pig_latin_words = []\n    \n    # Define a function that transforms one word into pig latin\n    function transform_word(word::AbstractString)\n        if length(word) > 0 && isletter(word[1])\n            first_char = word[1]\n            rest = word[2:end] * \"ay\"\n            return string(first_char, rest)\n        else\n            return word * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Use Threads.@threads to create a new thread for each word in the input array\n    @threads for word in words\n        push!(pig_latin_words, transform_word(lowercase(word)))\n    end\n    \n    return pig_latin_words\nend\n```\nThis function takes an array of strings as input and returns a new array with each string transformed into pig latin. The `transform_word` function is defined inside the main function to avoid scoping issues. Each word in the input array is processed by a separate thread, which can significantly speed up processing for large arrays.\n\nPlease note that this code does not handle punctuation or capitalization and treats all words as lowercase. You may need to add additional error checking depending on your specific requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,330],"elapsed":2.997666636,"_type":"aimessage"}]
