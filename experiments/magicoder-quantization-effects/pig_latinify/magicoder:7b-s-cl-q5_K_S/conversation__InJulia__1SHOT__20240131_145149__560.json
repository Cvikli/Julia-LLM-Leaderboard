Here is an example of how you might implement `pig_latinify`:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    @threads for word in words\n        println(pig_latin_word(word))\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_word(word)\n    # Pig Latin transformation logic here...\n    return word\nend\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `pig_latinify` that takes a vector of strings as input. It uses the `@threads` macro to create new threads for each iteration of the loop, allowing these operations to run in parallel.\n\nPlease note that this is just an example and you need to define your own logic inside `pig_latin_word` function according to Pig Latin rules.","status":200,"tokens":[0,200],"elapsed":1.688826296,"_type":"aimessage"}]
