[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of words and applies the `pig_latinify_word` function to each word in parallel using Julia's `@async` macro and `@sync` macro for synchronizing threads.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_word` function checks if the first letter of the word is a vowel, and if it is, it appends \"way\" at the end of the word and moves to the next letter. If it's not, it takes the first letter, adds it at the end of the rest of the word, then adds \"ay\".\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"orange\", \"banana\"]\nprintln(pig_latinify(words)) # Prints: [\"appleyay\", \"orangway\", \"ananabay\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,470],"elapsed":4.099862295,"_type":"aimessage"}]
