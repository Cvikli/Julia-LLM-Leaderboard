[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `@sync begin ... @async end` construct is used to create a synchronized block of code that can spawn multiple threads. For each word in the input vector, it creates an asynchronous task (using `@async`) that executes the `pig_latinify()` function on this word and prints the result.\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function itself operates by adding \"ay\" to the end of every word and shifting all letters in the input string to the right, except for the first letter which is moved to the end. If the first letter is uppercase, the entire result will also be uppercase; if it's lowercase, the result will be lowercase.\n\nPlease replace `{{instructions}}` with your special instructions as needed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,355],"elapsed":3.080586035,"_type":"aimessage"}]
