[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the implementation of `pig_latinify` function using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String}; threads = Threads.nthreads())\n    results = Array{Union{Missing, String}}(missing, length(words))\n    \n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        results[i] = pig_latinify(words[i])\n    end\n    \n    return results\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(word::String)\n    if isempty(word)\n        return word\n    elseif lowercase(first(word)) in 'aeiou'\n        return string(word, \"way\")\n    else\n        return join([string(word[2:end], word[1]), \"ay\"], '')\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function uses `Threads.@threads` to run the iterations over each string in a separate thread. The `pig_latinify` method translates a word into Pig Latin. If the first letter of the word is vowel (a, e, i, o or u), it adds \"way\" to the end of the word. Else, it moves the initial consonant cluster to the end and appends \"ay\".\n\nNote: The function `pig_latinify(word::String)` is called in a loop over the vector `words::Vector{String}` by the main function `pig_latinify(words::Vector{String}; threads = Threads.nthreads())`. This is a way to apply parallelism and multithreading in Julia, where each iteration runs on its own thread. The results are stored in an array of the same size as words, but some elements may be `missing` because we cannot know their value until all threads have finished running.","status":200,"tokens":[0,410],"elapsed":3.613908027,"_type":"aimessage"}]
