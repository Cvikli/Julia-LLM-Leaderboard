The `pig_latin` function is applied asynchronously on each word of the input list. \n\nPlease note that the `Distributed` and `Transformers` packages need to be installed for this script to run. You can install them via the Julia package manager with the command `pkg> add Distributed Transformers`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,233],"elapsed":1.99291547,"_type":"aimessage"}]
