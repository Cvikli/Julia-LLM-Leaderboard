Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can achieve this in Julia using the Threads package:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    result = similar(words, 0)\n    @threads for word in words\n        push!(result, pig_latin_transform(word))\n    end\n    return result\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_transform(word)\n    # Pig Latin transformation rules:\n    # 1. If a word starts with a vowel, add \"way\" to the end of the word and move it to the start.\n    # 2. Otherwise, move the first consonant cluster to the end of the word and add \"ay\".\n\n    if occursin(r'^[aeiou]', word)\n        return \"way\" * word\n    else\n        match = match(r'^([bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz]+)[a-z]*', word)\n        if match !== nothing && length(match.captures[1]) > 0\n            return match.captures[1] * match.match * \"ay\"\n        else\n            # If no consonant cluster is found, just add \"ay\".\n            return word * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `pig_latinify` that takes in a vector of strings and returns the same vector but with each string transformed to Pig Latin. It uses `@threads` macro for parallel processing, meaning that it will create a new thread for every word in the input array.\n\nThe `pig_latin_transform` function is used by `pig_latinify` to transform each individual word into Pig Latin. This function checks if the first letter of the word is a vowel (using regex) and applies the appropriate transformation rules accordingly. If no consonant cluster is found, it just adds \"ay\" at the end of the word.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that words are separated by spaces in the input vector. It also does not handle punctuation or capitalization in any special way (it treats all letters as lowercase and ignores non-letter characters). You might need to modify it if you have different requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,509],"elapsed":4.359172887,"_type":"aimessage"}]
