This is because we want to handle capital letters and small letters the same way in pig Latin.\n- We also define the list of vowels.\n- Then, inside the function, we define another inner function `translate_word`, which takes a word as input. \n- Inside this function, if the first letter of the word is a vowel, it adds \"way\" to the end of the word. If not, it moves the first letter to the end and appends \"ay\".\n- Finally, we use the `concurrent.futures` module's ThreadPoolExecutor to apply the translation function in parallel to all words in the input list. We then join all the translations together into a string and return this string.","status":200,"tokens":[99,454],"elapsed":3.987688522,"_type":"aimessage"}]
