The function `pig_latinify` is defined inside the `@everywhere` block, so it can access the outer scope variable `words`. \n\nThe `@sync begin ... end` construct ensures that all the asynchronous tasks started with `@async` are executed in a synchronous way. This is necessary because we want to wait for all threads to finish before printing the results.\n\nEach word in the input vector is processed on a separate thread thanks to the `@async` macro, which schedules the execution of the enclosed block asynchronously. The result of each task is printed out immediately when it's ready.","status":200,"tokens":[0,383],"elapsed":3.33453272,"_type":"aimessage"}]
