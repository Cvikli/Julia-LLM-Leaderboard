It also defines a function `pig_latinify_vector`, which takes a vector of strings, and for each string in the vector, spawns a new thread to run the `pig_latinify` function on that string.\n\nPlease note that you need to start Julia with `--threads=n` where n is greater than 1 to enable multi-threading.\n\nThis code assumes that words starting with \"a\" or \"e\" are not moved in pig latin, and the first letter of each word is moved to the end along with \"ay\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,433],"elapsed":3.678670039,"_type":"aimessage"}]
