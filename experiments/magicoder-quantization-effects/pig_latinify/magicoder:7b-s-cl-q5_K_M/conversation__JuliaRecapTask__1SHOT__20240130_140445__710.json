[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The function `pig_latinify` takes a vector of strings as an argument.\n2. The `@distributed (vcat)` macro is used to perform parallel processing on the CPU cores available on your machine, which can speed up the program.\n3. Inside the loop inside the macro, each string in the input vector is split into words using `split`.\n4. If a word starts with an alphabetic character (checked by `isletter(word[1])`), it's transformed to pig latin and added to the result array (`translated_words`). The transformation consists of adding \"ay\" at the end of the word.\n5. Non-alphabetic words, such as punctuation marks or numbers in your input strings, are kept unchanged (in this case, we do not add \"ay\" to them).\n6. Finally, each translated word is joined back into a string with spaces in between using `join`. This resulting string is added to the output array (`result`).\n7. The function returns the entire result array.","status":200,"tokens":[0,426],"elapsed":3.838288269,"_type":"aimessage"}]
