Here is an example using Julia's multi-threading and string manipulation features:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    function transform_word(word)\n        word_len = length(word)\n        first_char = word[1]\n        if islowercase(first_char) || isdigit(first_char)\n            return string(\"ay-\", word)\n        elseif isuppercase(first_char) \n            return uppercase(string(\"Ay-\", word))\n        end\n    end\n    \n    result = Threads.@spawn map(transform_word, words)\n    return fetch(result)\nend\n```\nThis function `pig_latinify` takes a vector of strings as input and returns a new vector with each string transformed into pig latin. The inner function `transform_word` is applied to each element in the input vector concurrently, thanks to Julia's `@spawn` macro which allows us to run code on separate threads.\n\nThe function checks if the first character of each word is a letter and not a digit or special character. If it is, it appends \"ay-\" at the end of the word; if it is an uppercase letter, it changes it to lowercase and does the same operation.","status":200,"tokens":[0,303],"elapsed":2.600334637,"_type":"aimessage"}]
