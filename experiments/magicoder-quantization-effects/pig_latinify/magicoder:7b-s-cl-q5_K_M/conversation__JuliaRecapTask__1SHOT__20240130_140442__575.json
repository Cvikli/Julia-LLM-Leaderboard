[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

We start with `addprocs(2)` to create two workers. This allows us to split our work into parts and distribute it across multiple cores. \n\nThen we define the function `pig_latinify` which uses `@spawn onidle()` to run an anonymous function that iterates over each string in the input vector (a SharedArray, so it can be shared among all workers) and translates each word into pig latin. This is done on every worker concurrently. \n\nAnd finally we define `pig_latin_single` which takes a single string, splits it into the first part (which becomes the start of the new string), and the rest, then transforms this word into pig latin. If the word begins with an uppercase letter, the first character is left as it is in Pig Latin (because it's already capitalized). If it begins with a lowercase letter, we move it to the end of the new string and capitalize it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,456],"elapsed":4.108682404,"_type":"aimessage"}]
