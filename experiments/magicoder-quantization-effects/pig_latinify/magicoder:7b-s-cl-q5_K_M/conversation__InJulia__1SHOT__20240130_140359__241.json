The `pig_latin_word` function takes one string, converts it to an array of characters, removes the first character, adds \"ay\" at the beginning and then adds the removed first character at the end again. The `@threads` macro is used for parallel computing in Julia which creates a new thread for each iteration of the loop.\n\nPlease note that Pig Latin is actually a language game and not a universal transformation. This code just changes the first letter of every word to \"ay\" appended to the rest of the word (except the first character).","status":200,"tokens":[0,318],"elapsed":2.792811031,"_type":"aimessage"}]
