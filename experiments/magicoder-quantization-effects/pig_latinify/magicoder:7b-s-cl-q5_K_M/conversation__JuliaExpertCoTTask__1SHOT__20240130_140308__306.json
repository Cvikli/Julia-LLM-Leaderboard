Each thread processes one word from the array, converting it to its pig latin equivalent. \nFinally, we use `fetch(t)` to get the result for each thread and join them together with a space in between. The final string is then appended with \"ay\" to make sure the output follows the Pig Latin rules.","status":200,"tokens":[0,287],"elapsed":2.472982217,"_type":"aimessage"}]
