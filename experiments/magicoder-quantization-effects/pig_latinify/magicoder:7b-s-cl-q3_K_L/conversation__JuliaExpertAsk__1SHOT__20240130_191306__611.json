It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can create this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n@everywhere using Pkg; Pkg.activate(\".\"); Pkg.instantiate()\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    @showprogress \"Converting to Pig Latin...\" for word in words\n        # Split the word into a list of letters and move first letter to end\n        pig_word = [word[i] for i in length(word):-1:1...]\n        \n        # Join them together to form the new word, and add 'ay'\n        pig_word = join(pig_word, \"\") * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes an array of strings as input. For each string in the input, it converts that string into Pig Latin (moving the first letter to the end and appending 'ay'). It uses `@showprogress` from the `Distributed` package for showing a progress bar while transforming each word into pig latin.\n\nPlease note this is just an illustrative example and doesn't account for some special cases in Pig Latin grammar, such as ending words with certain letters or vowels (e.g., \"qu\" becomes \"iquay\"). You may need to adjust the code based on your specific requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,295],"elapsed":2.365072571,"_type":"aimessage"}]
