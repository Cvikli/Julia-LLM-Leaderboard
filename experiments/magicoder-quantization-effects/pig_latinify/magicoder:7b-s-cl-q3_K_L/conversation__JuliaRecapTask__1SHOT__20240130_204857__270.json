[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In this case, we don't have any specific instructions about how the pig latin transformation should be done. Here is an example of how you can implement such function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    threads = Vector{Threads.Task}(undef, length(words))\n    for i in 1:length(threads)\n        first_letter = words[i][1]\n        rest = words[i][2:end] * \"_ay\" # Adding \"ay\" at the end of word after removing its first letter\n        threads[i] = @async (println(first_letter * \"ay_\" * rest))\n    end\n    Threads.wait.(threads)\nend\n```\nThis function `pig_latinify` takes a vector of strings as input, and for each string it creates a new thread that transforms the word to pig latin (adding \"ay\" at the end). \nPlease note that this is a very simple way to transform words into Pig Latin. In real-world applications you would need to handle other aspects like capitalization of first letter, punctuation handling, etc.\nAlso remember that Julia's `Threads` module doesn't actually create new OS threads but uses lightweight tasks that can be scheduled on available CPU cores.","status":200,"tokens":[0,295],"elapsed":2.391638596,"_type":"aimessage"}]
