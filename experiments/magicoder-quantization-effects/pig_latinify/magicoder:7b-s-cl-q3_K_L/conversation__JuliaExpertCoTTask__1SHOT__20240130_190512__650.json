It's applied to each word in the list using multiple threads. Because we are not doing anything with the results of our translations, we don't actually need to store them anywhere; the translated words just get thrown away as soon as they're calculated.\n\nPlease note that Python isn't designed for parallel programming like C++ or Java due to its Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). To truly take advantage of multithreading, you may want to use a language better suited for this task such as Scala or Java.","status":200,"tokens":[0,315],"elapsed":2.559967847,"_type":"aimessage"}]
