We then use `@threads` from Julia's parallel computing toolkit to apply `shift_word` to each word in `words` on a separate thread. The result is printed out immediately for each word.\n\nWe can test this function with your example like so:\n\n```julia\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,208],"elapsed":1.708440117,"_type":"aimessage"}]
