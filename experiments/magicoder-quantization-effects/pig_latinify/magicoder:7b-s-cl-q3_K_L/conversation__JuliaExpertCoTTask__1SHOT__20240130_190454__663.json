Within this function, another nested function named `convertWordToPigLatin` is defined to convert each individual string from the input into pig latin. \n\nThe `@distributed (threads=true)` macro allows for parallel computing within Julia. This statement indicates that the computation inside the parenthesis should be carried out in parallel on multiple threads. \n\nFinally, we call this nested function with `for word in words` and return the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,249],"elapsed":2.053936381,"_type":"aimessage"}]
