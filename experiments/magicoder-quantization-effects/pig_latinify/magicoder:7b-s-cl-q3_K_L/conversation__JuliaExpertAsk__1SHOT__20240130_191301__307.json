It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, the function `map` is equivalent to Python's list comprehension which makes it perfect for transforming an array with a function operating concurrently using threads. Here's how you can implement this:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(str_list::Array{String})\n    Threads.@threads for str in str_list\n        println(piglatin_word(str))\n    end\nend\n\nfunction piglatin_word(word)\n    vowels = ['a','e','i','o','u']\n    word = lowercase(word)\n    \n    if first(word) in vowels \n        return string(word * \"way\")\n    else \n        return string(word[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn the above code, `pig_latinify` function applies the `piglatin_word` function to each string in str_list concurrently. The `piglatin_word` function is responsible for converting a single word into pig latin. If the first character of the word is a vowel, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word. Otherwise, it takes all characters except the first one and places them at the end followed by the first letter and then \"ay\".\n\nPlease note that `println` used in the `pig_latinify` function will print the pig latin version of each word on different lines. To collect all transformed words into a list, you can return an array from the `piglatin_word` function instead of using `println`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,366],"elapsed":2.960192862,"_type":"aimessage"}]
