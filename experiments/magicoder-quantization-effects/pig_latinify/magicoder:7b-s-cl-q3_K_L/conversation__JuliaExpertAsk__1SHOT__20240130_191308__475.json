It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is an example of how this might be done in Julia:\n```julia\nimport Base.Threads.@threads\n\n# Function to add 'ay' to the end of words without vowels\nfunction add_to_end(word::String)\n    last_two_chars = word[end-1:end]\n    if !(last_two_chars in [\"aeiouAEIOU\"])\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    else \n        return word\n    end\nend\n\n# Function to pig latinify a string\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Array{String,1})\n   @threads for word in words\n       println(add_to_end(word))\n    end\nend\n\n# Test the function with an array of strings\nstrings = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"how\"]\npig_latinify(strings)\n```\nIn this code, `@threads` creates a new scope where multi-threading is enabled. For each word in the input array, `add_to_end` function checks whether the last two characters of the word are vowels or not. If it's not then the `ay` is added to the end of that string and print otherwise the original word remains same. The `pig_latinify` function uses this process for each string in the array.","status":200,"tokens":[0,302],"elapsed":2.408071117,"_type":"aimessage"}]
