Please note that Python's GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) allows only one thread to execute at a time in a single process, hence, threads execution is not truly parallel on CPU, but we are using it here for practice and learning purpose.","status":200,"tokens":[0,353],"elapsed":2.902515699,"_type":"aimessage"}]
