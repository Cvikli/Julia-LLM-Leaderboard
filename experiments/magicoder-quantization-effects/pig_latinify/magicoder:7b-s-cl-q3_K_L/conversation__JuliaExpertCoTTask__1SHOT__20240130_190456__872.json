[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the solution in Julia:\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    result = zeros(Int, length(words))\n\n    @threads for i=1:length(words)\n        word = words[i]\n        first_letter = word[1]\n        rest = word[2:end]\n        \n        new_word = string(rest, first_letter, \"ay\")\n        result[i] = new_word\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\n```\n\nThis function uses the `@threads` macro to create a thread for each word in the input vector. It then constructs the pig latin version of each word and stores it in a results array, which is returned at the end.\n\nPlease note that pig Latin is a game of words where words are transformed by moving the initial consonant or consonant cluster to the end of the word and adding \"ay\". It is not only limited to English but also used in other languages like Spanish (“calafate”), Italian (“mangiaguava”, “agnello”) and so on.","status":200,"tokens":[0,278],"elapsed":2.225372727,"_type":"aimessage"}]
