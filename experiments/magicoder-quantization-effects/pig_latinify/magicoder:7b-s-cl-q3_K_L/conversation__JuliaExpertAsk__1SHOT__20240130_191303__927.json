Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can implement this in Julia using threads:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)\n    len = length(strings)\n    @threads for i in 1:len\n        strings[i] = pig_latin_transform(strings[i])\n    end\n    return strings\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_transform(string)\n    words = split(string, ' ')\n    transformed_words = @view Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    for (i, word) in enumerate(words)\n        first_letter = word[1]\n        rest = word[2:end]\n        transformed_word = string(rest, first_letter, \"ay\")\n        transformed_words[i] = transformed_word\n    end\n    return join(transformed_words, ' ')\nend\n```\n\nThis code defines two functions. `pig_latinify` is the main function that iterates over each string in a vector and transforms it to pig latin using multithreading. The function `pig_latin_transform` is a helper function that transforms one word at a time into pig latin.\n\nThe `@threads for ... end` syntax tells Julia to execute the loop body on separate threads. This means you're taking advantage of multi-core processing in your CPU when running this code on a machine with multiple cores.","status":200,"tokens":[0,325],"elapsed":2.591205609,"_type":"aimessage"}]
