It splits the input string into words and checks each word's first alphabetic character to decide whether it should be appended with \"ay\".\n- The `threaded_pig_latinify!` function accepts a vector of strings, divides them among different threads, and runs `pig_latinify` on each thread. It uses Julia's Transducers package for parallel computation.","status":200,"tokens":[0,449],"elapsed":3.471075505,"_type":"aimessage"}]
