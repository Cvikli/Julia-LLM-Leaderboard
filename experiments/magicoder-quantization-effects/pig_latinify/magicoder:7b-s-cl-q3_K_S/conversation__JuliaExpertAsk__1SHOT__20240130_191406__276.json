It's then used to apply the transformation on each word in parallel using Julia's Threads.jl package. This is achieved through mapping over the words and passing each one along with its index to the helper function, then joining the results back together into strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,348],"elapsed":2.761011442,"_type":"aimessage"}]
