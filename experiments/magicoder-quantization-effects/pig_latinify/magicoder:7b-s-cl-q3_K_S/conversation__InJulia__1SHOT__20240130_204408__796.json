Inside this function, we use a Transducer to transform each word in the input vector. This is done using the `transduce` function provided by Julia's standard library. \nThe logic inside the transducer checks if the last character of each string is either a vowel (or 'y') or ends with a consonant, and if so, it returns a pig latin version of the word: moving all consonants to the end while preserving their original order. If not, we leave it as it was.\nFinally, `transduce` reduces the Transducer into a single value (a vector in this case) and `@show` prints this result. \nThis script will return [\"appelpig\", \"orangway\", \"ananabay\"].","status":200,"tokens":[0,446],"elapsed":3.448893512,"_type":"aimessage"}]
