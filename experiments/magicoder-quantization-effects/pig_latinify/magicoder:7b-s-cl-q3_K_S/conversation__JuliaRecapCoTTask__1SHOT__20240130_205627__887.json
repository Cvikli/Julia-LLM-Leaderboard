[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

We'll do all iterations simultaneously using threads from the parallel processing package.\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)\n    function translate(word, i)\n        if length(word) > 1 && isletter(first(word)) && isletter(last(word))\n            return \"$(i),$(word[2:end])$(word[1])ay\"\n        elseif first(word) in ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')\n            return \"$(i),$(word*'ay')\"\n        else\n            return \"$(i),$(word)\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    words = split.(strings, ', ') # Split the sentences into words\n    return [Threads.@spawn translate(w[1], w[2]) for w in enumerate(words)] \nend\n```\nThis function first splits each string into words. For each word, it checks if the word is a valid English word by checking if it starts and ends with a letter. If so, it translates it to pig latin by moving the first letter to the end of the word and adding \"ay\". If not, it assumes that the word is a non-English word (like an HTML tag), and just adds it without translation.\n\nFinally, we return an array with each translated string in its own thread using `Threads.@spawn`. This allows all translations to be computed simultaneously on multiple cores of your CPU, improving performance.\n\nPlease note that the instructions from special instructions will not be considered for this problem's solutuon as it is a general task in language processing and not related to any specific software development project. The function `pig_latinify` does what it needs to do regardless of other tasks or threads.","status":200,"tokens":[0,443],"elapsed":3.507627853,"_type":"aimessage"}]
