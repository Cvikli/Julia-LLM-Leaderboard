X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Here is how you would implement this:\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    function translate(s::String)\n        words = split(s, ' ')  # Split the string into words.\n        for i in eachindex(words)\n            word = lowercase(first(words[i]))  # Convert first letter to lowercase.\n            if isletter(word[1]) && !in(\"aeiou\", word)  # If it's a consonant sound.\n                words[i] *= \"ay\"  # Add \"ay\".\n            else\n                words[i] = s[firstindex(s):end]  # Move the entire string to the end.\n            end\n        end\n        return join(words, ' ')  # Join all words back into a string.\n    end\n    results = Threads.nthreads() > 1 ? fill(nothing, length(strings)) : nothing\n    @sync for i in eachthread(eachindex(strings))\n        if results !== nothing\n            results[i] = Threads.@spawn translate(strings[i])\n        else\n            translate(strings[i])\n        end\n    end\n    return results === nothing ? [translate(strings[i]) for i in eachindex(strings)] : results\nend\n```\nThis function splits each input string into words and processes them one by one. It checks if the first letter of each word is a vowel, and if it's not, it appends \"ay\" to the end of that word. If it is, it moves the entire string onto the end of the word. This translates the original strings into pig latin.\n\nNote: We use `Threads.@spawn` to start a new task and return immediately while leaving the task running in the background. The `@sync` keyword makes sure that all threads are finished before returning from the function. If you want to wait for all tasks to finish, remove the `@sync`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,489],"elapsed":3.846542469,"_type":"aimessage"}]
