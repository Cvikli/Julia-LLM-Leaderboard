[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

But I can give you an example of how you might approach creating this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    # Iterate over each word and apply pig latin transformation on them using threads\n    Threads.@threads for word in words\n        # Translate the first consonant cluster, if it exists\n        m = match(r\"^([bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz]*)\", word)\n        pre = m === nothing ? \"\" : m.match\n        \n        postfix = \"way $pre\" * (word[endof(word)] == 'a' || word[endof(word)] == 'e' || word[endof(word)] == 'i' || word[endof(word)] == 'o' || word[endof(word)] == 'u') ? \"\" : \"ay\"\n        \n        # Return the transformed word \n        print(pre * postfix)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `Base.Threads.@threads` macro to ensure that the iterations are done in parallel on multiple threads, which can greatly speed up computations if you have a very large list of words. Please note that the logic for Pig Latin translation is quite simplistic and may not cover all cases perfectly (for example, it assumes no vowels at the end of a word). If you need a more accurate translator, consider using a Natural Language Processing library such as Julia's `Text.jl` or other Python libraries specialized in NLP tasks.\nRemember to replace `{{instructions}}` with your actual instructions if any.","status":200,"tokens":[0,402],"elapsed":3.178733722,"_type":"aimessage"}]
