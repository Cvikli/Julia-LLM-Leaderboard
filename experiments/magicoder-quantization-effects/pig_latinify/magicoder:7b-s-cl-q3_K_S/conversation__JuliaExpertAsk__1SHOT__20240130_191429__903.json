Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you could achieve this by using the multithreading functionality from Base package through the Threads.@threads macro. Here's an example of how it can be implemented:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strs::Vector{T}) where {T <: AbstractString} \n    function translate(i, str) where {T}\n        words = split(str)\n        for (i, word) in enumerate(words)\n            if occursin(r\"[aeiouAEIOU]\", word)\n                words[i] *= 'ay'\n            else\n                words[i] = word[2:end]*word[1]*'ay'\n            end\n        end\n        return join(words, \" \")\n    end\n    \n    results = Vector{T}()\n    Threads.@threads for str in strs\n        push!(results, translate(str))\n    end\n    return results\nend\n```\nThis function works by first defining a helper inner function that takes an index `i` and string `str`, translates the string into pig latin according to its rules (if a word starts with a vowel it just appends \"ay\" at the end, otherwise it moves the initial consonant cluster to the end and appends \"ay\"), then it pushes each resulting translated string into an output Vector.","status":200,"tokens":[0,303],"elapsed":2.388155433,"_type":"aimessage"}]
