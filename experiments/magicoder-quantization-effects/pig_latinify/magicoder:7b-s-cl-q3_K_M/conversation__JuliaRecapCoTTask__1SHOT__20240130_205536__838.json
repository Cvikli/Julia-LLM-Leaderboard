[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Here's how you could solve this problem:\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::AbstractVector{<:AbstractString})\n    function pig_latinify_word(word)\n        if word[1] in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n            return word * \"way\"\n        else\n            return string(split(word)[2:end], \"_\", split(word)[1])\n        end\n    end\n\n    result = Threads.@spawn map(pig_latinify_word, words)\n    fetch(result)\nend\n```\nThis function works by creating a new thread for each word in the input vector. The `fetch` statement is used to wait until all threads have finished and then return the result from the main thread.\n\nNote that the use of `@spawn` doesn't mean that the map operation will be performed concurrently, but rather it will launch a new task (which can run in any order) which will perform the `map` operation when its turn comes up. It is necessary to use `fetch(result)` to wait for all the threads to complete and then return the result.\n\nAlso keep in mind that this function does not guarantee perfect parallelism because the workload of each thread could be different, but it does allow multiple tasks to run simultaneously which can speed up execution on multicore CPUs.","status":200,"tokens":[0,344],"elapsed":2.684892402,"_type":"aimessage"}]
