Each task will convert one word to Pig Latin. Then it waits for each thread to finish and fetches the result, storing it in `result`. The word conversion is done with a helper function `pig_latinify(word::AbstractString)`. This function checks whether the first letter of the word is a vowel, and if so, appends \"way\" to the end. If not, it extracts the first letter and appends \"ay\".\n\nYou can test this function with `println.(pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]))`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,342],"elapsed":2.659132269,"_type":"aimessage"}]
