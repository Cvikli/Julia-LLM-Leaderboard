It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is an example of how you could implement the function using Julia's concurrency features. We will use `Threads.@spawn` macro for creating new threads in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    result = Vector{String}()\n    \n    @sync begin\n        for word in words\n            push!(result, Threads.Atomic(Threads.@spawn pig_latin(word)))  # start a new thread for each word\n        end\n        \n        # wait until all threads are finished\n        for t in result\n            wait(t) \n        end\n    end\n    \n    return [fetch(t) for t in result]  # retrieve the results from the threads\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word::String)\n    if islowercase(first(word))  # check if first letter of word is lower case\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    elseif isuppercase(first(word))  # check if first letter of word is upper case\n        return word[2:end] * word[1]*\"ay\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nHere, `pig_latinify` function creates a new thread for each string in the input vector and waits until all threads are finished. The result is fetched from the threads after they finish their execution. Each thread uses the pig_latin function to transform a word into Pig Latin.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function checks whether the first letter of the input string is lower case or upper case and applies the appropriate transformation to create Pig Latin form of the string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,370],"elapsed":2.7765789,"_type":"aimessage"}]
