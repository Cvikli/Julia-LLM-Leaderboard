[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you might solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads, Transformers\n\npig_latinify(str::AbstractString) = split(str, ' ') |> pig_latin |> join \nfunction pig_latin(words)\n    words .|> pig_latin |> Threads.@threads map(reverse)\nend\nfunction pig_latin(word)\n    if word[1] in vowels\n        return uppercase(word * \"ay\") \n    else\n        return word[2:end]*\"ay\"*uppercasefirst(word[1])\n    end\nend\nvowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n```\nThe `pig_latinify` function is the main one that applies pig latin transformation to each word in a string. It takes advantage of Julia's parallelism to convert multiple words at once using threads. \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that input strings are space-separated and vowels are only the initial consonants, not the ones within the words. If you want to use another set of rules for transforming into pig latin, you can modify the `pig_latin` function as needed. \n\nAlso, please note that this solution may be slower than it could possibly be if multithreading was not used due to Julia's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), which prevents more than one thread from executing at once in a single process.","status":200,"tokens":[0,349],"elapsed":2.713088969,"_type":"aimessage"}]
