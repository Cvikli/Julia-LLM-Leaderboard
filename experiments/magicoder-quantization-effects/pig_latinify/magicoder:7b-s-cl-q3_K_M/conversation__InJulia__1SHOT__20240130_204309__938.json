The function `pig_latinify` splits the words into a tuple with their indices which are then passed as arguments to separate threads, each performing the Pig Latin translation on one word. \n\nNote: You need to install and import Julia's Distributed package before running this code. Run `using Distributed; addprocs()` in your Julia REPL to start the distributed computing system if it is not already active.","status":200,"tokens":[103,478],"elapsed":7.335612123,"_type":"aimessage"}]
