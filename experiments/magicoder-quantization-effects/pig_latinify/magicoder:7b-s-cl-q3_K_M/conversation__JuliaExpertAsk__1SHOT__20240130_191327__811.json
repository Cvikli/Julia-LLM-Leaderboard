[uppercase(char)] : [] end\n\n        if isempty(word)\n            result[i] = strings[i] # keep the original string as is for non-alphabetic input or single character words\n        elseif length(word) == 1\n            result[i] = word * \"AY\"\n        else\n            first_char, rest = popfirst!(word), word\n            push!(rest, first_char * \"AY\")\n            result[i] = join(rest, \"\")\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Filter out nothing values from result and return the remaining strings\n    filter!(x -> x !== nothing, result)\nend\n```\nThis function will transform words to Pig Latin by moving first consonant or vowel to the end of the word and adding \"AY\" at the beginning. Non-alphabetic or single character words are kept as is, and non-word symbols (like punctuation) are ignored. \n\nThe function uses Julia's threading capabilities to run each iteration of the loop on a separate thread for better performance. This approach can be beneficial if you are dealing with large collections of strings where parallel processing improves overall speed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,376],"elapsed":2.900314774,"_type":"aimessage"}]
