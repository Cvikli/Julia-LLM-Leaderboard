It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you can implement this in Julia:\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads, Distributed\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::AbstractVector{<: AbstractString})\n    function shift_word(word)\n        word = split(lowercase(word))\n        return vcat(\"$(word[2])ay\", word[1])\n    end\n    \n    Threads.threaded(shift_word, words)\nend\n\n# Test the function\nwords = [\"apple\", \"orange\", \"banana\"]\nprintln(pig_latinify(words))\n```\nIn this script:\n- `shift_word` function takes a word as input and returns pig latin form of it. \n- We then use `Threads.threaded` to apply `shift_word` function on each element in the vector in separate threads.\n\nPlease note that Julia doesn't support multithreading for CPU intensive tasks (such as this one) due to its Global Interpreter Lock(GIL). For these kind of tasks, Julia provides libraries like Distributed and JULIA_NUM_THREADS environment variable which allows you to run multiple threads for IO-bound tasks.\n\nPlease note that Pig Latin is a way to translate English words into an \"English-ish\" language by moving the first letter to the end of the word and adding \"ay\". So, in this case, the function `shift_word` will be changing each word from its initial position in English to its pig latin equivalent.","status":200,"tokens":[0,343],"elapsed":2.677667169,"_type":"aimessage"}]
