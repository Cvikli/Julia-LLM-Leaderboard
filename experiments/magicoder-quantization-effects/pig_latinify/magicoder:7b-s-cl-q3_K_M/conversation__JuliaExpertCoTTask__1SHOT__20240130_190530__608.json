[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the code snippet in Julia that solves the problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed, Transducers\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    @everywhere function transform!(word::AbstractString)\n        return \"$(last(word))ay $(first(word))$(length(word)-1)\"\n    end\n\n    Threads.@threads map(transform!, words)\nend\n```\n\nThis solution uses the `@thread` macro from Julia's Distributed module to run the transformation on each word in separate threads. This is a simple way to get multi-threading in Julia, but it should be noted that you need to have sufficient cores available for this to work as expected.\n\nTo use `pig_latinify`, simply call it with your vector of strings:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]\nresult = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln.(result)\n```\nThis code first defines a transformation function that takes in one word and transforms it into Pig Latin. Then, `pig_latinify` applies this transformation to every word in the input vector using `@threads`, running each transformation in its own thread. The transformed words are returned as a new vector.","status":200,"tokens":[0,281],"elapsed":2.180461362,"_type":"aimessage"}]
