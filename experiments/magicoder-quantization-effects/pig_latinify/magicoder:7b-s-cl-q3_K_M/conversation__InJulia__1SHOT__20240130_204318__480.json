It breaks this array up into chunks to be processed by different threads. The pig latin transformation is applied within each thread and the results are collected together afterwards. \n\nThe pig latin transformation step, represented by `pig_latin_step`, operates on individual words from the input string. For each word, it checks if the first letter is a vowel; if not, it moves the initial consonant to the end of the word and appends \"ay\"; if yes, it moves the first two letters to the end and adds \"ay\". \n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nstrings = [\"apple\", \"orange\", \"grape\"]\nprintln(pig_latinify(strings)) # This will print ['applpay', 'orangay', 'egarapay']\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,509],"elapsed":3.850946138,"_type":"aimessage"}]
