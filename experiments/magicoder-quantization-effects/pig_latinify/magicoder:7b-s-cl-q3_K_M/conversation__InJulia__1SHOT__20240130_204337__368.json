It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, the multi-threading is not directly supported as Python due to its simplicity. However, you can use parallel computing package such as DistributedArrays or SharedArray in Julia for this purpose. Here's an example using DistributedArrays:\n\n```julia\nusing DistributedArrays\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::AbstractVector{<:AbstractString})\n    str_darr = distribute(strings)\n    pig_latin_darr = @distribute map(pig_latin, str_darr)\n    collect(pig_latin_darr)\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(s::AbstractString) \n    words = split(s)\n    pig_latin_words = map(pig_latin_word, words)\n    join(pig_latin_words)\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_word(w::AbstractString)\n    if w[1] in vowels \n        return string(w*\"ay\")\n    else\n        return string(w[2:end]*\"ay\",\" \",w[1])\n    end\nend\n\nvowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n```\nThis program firstly splits each sentence into words using `split` function. Then it applies the `pig_latin_word` to every word. The `pig_latin_word` function will check if a word starts with vowel, if yes then it adds \"ay\" at end of the word, else it moves first letter to end and append \"ay\" at end. Finally it joins all the words back into sentence using `join`.\n\nPlease note that this is just an example for illustration purposes and might not cover some edge cases in English language. Also, please install DistributedArrays package by running `Pkg.add(\"DistributedArrays\")` beforehand.","status":200,"tokens":[0,433],"elapsed":3.263097055,"_type":"aimessage"}]
