X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Each element is in Pig Latin form. The order of the returned array might not match with the input array due to multithreading.\n\nIn the implementation, `@spawn lock(result) do ... end` spawns a new thread for processing each string in `str_vec`. When the string is processed and stored into the `results[index]`, it's wrapped by `lock()` function. This ensures that only one thread can access this result at any given time, making it thread-safe.\n\nThe `@sync begin...end` block provides a mechanism for controlling the execution order of tasks within a single process. Without `@sync`, all the threads might be scheduled concurrently. \n\nThis function assumes that all strings only contain alphabets and spaces. It also doesn't handle special characters or punctuation. For more complex strings (e.g., including upper case letters, non-alphabetic characters, etc.), additional logic would need to be added.","status":200,"tokens":[0,577],"elapsed":4.507898808,"_type":"aimessage"}]
