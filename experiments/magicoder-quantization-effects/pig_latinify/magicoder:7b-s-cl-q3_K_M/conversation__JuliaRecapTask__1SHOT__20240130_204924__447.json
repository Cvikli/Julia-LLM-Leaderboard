[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin.

Vowels are treated differently because they don't have any consonants before them. The function starts with an empty Vector `words` and iterates over each word in `words`. Each iteration will create a new pig latin word and add it to `results`.\nThe `Transformers` package is used for the parallel execution on different threads, but it's not necessary for this task - you could easily implement multithreading manually with the `Distributed` package. \n\nIn terms of special instructions, if a user provides them, they might affect how the program operates. For example, \"Pig Latin\" typically involves moving all consonants to the end of a word and adding \"ay\", but if someone wanted the Pig Latin version to start with \"eway\" for words that begin with vowels, it could be added as a special instruction.","status":200,"tokens":[0,494],"elapsed":3.865329615,"_type":"aimessage"}]
