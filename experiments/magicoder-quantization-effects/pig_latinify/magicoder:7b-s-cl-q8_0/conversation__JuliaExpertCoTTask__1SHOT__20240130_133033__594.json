Here's how you could approach it:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    function pig_latin(word)\n        first = word[1]\n        rest = word[2:end]\n        return \"$rest$firstay\"\n    end\n    threads = Vector{Threads.Task}(undef, length(words))  # Create a vector of Threads.Task for storage\n    @inbounds for i in eachindex(threads)  # Iterate over the indices of the 'threads' array\n        words[i] do thread_word\n            @async begin  # Start a new asynchronous task\n                push!(threads, Threads.@spawn pig_latin(thread_word))\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    join([fetch(t) for t in threads])\nend\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\n```\n\nHere, `pig_latin` is a helper function that takes a string (word), separates it into the first character and rest of the word, and then constructs the pig latin translation by appending these two parts in reverse order. The `pig_latinify` function creates a separate thread for each word in the input vector, using `@spawn` to create a new task that runs `pig_latin`.\n\nNote: This is a simple example and doesn't include error handling or edge cases (like punctuation at the end of words). In a real-world scenario you would want to handle these cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,377],"elapsed":4.251903953,"_type":"aimessage"}]
