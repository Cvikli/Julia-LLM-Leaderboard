[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    # Create an array of threads\n    threads = [Threads.@spawn pig_latin(word) for word in words]\n    \n    # Wait until all threads are complete \n    Threads.wait.(threads)\n    \n    # Return the results as a vector\n    return [fetch(thread) for thread in threads]\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word::String)\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    \n    if islowercase(first_letter) \n        return \"$(word[2:end])ay\"\n    elseif isuppercase(first_letter)\n        return \"$(word[2:end])AY\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis `pig_latinify` function uses the `@spawn` macro from the Threads.jl package to create a new task (thread in Julia terminology) for each word passed to it. It then waits until all threads have finished with `Threads.wait(threads)`. The results are collected into an array and returned by `fetch(thread)` for each thread.\n\nThe pig_latin function converts a string to pig latin. If the first letter of the string is lowercase, it appends \"ay\" to the end of the word (making it pig latin). If the first letter is uppercase, it also makes it capitalized pig latin by adding \"AY\".\n  \nRemember to install Threads.jl package if you don't have it. You can do so using Pkg.add(\"Threads\") command in Julia REPL.","status":200,"tokens":[403,379],"elapsed":6.737236116,"_type":"aimessage"}]
