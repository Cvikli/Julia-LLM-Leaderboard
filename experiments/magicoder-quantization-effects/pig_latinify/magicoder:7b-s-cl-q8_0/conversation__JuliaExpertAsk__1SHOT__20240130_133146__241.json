Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the solution using Julia's multi-threading capabilities with the `@threads` macro.\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads: @spawn, @sync\n\nfunction pig_latinify(str::Vector{String})\n    # Create a channel for sending results back to main thread\n    result_channel = Channel(1)\n\n    # Iterate over each string in parallel threads\n    @threads for str_i in str\n        put!(result_channel, piglatinify_word.(str_i))\n    end\n\n    # Collect all results back into a vector\n    result = collect(take!(result_channel))\n\n    return result\nend\n\nfunction piglatinify_word(word::String)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    if first(word) in vowels\n        return string(word, \"way\")\n    elseif word[1:2] == \"qu\"\n        return string(\"quay\", word[3:end])\n    else\n        return string(word[2:end], word[1], \"ay\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, `pig_latinify` function creates a channel to pass the result of each word transformation back to the main thread. Each iteration over words is done in parallel threads spawned with `@threads`. The results are collected in the order they were sent back from the worker threads and stored into the vector.\n\nThe `piglatinify_word` function does the actual pig latin transformation of a word: it checks if the first letter is a vowel, then appends \"way\" to it; if the word starts with \"qu\", it changes that part to \"quay\" and keeps the rest; otherwise, it puts \"ay\" at the end of the word and moves the first character to the end.","status":200,"tokens":[0,424],"elapsed":4.852664724,"_type":"aimessage"}]
