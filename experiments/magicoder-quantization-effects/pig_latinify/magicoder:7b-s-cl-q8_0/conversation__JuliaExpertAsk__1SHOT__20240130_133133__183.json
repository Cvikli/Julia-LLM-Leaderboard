It creates an array to hold the pig latin versions for each string in parallel using separate threads. The `@spawn` macro is used to create these tasks, which run concurrently with other parts of your program. Each task updates its corresponding entry in the `result` array when it completes. After all tasks have finished, `Threads.wait.(threads)` ensures that we only continue when all threads have completed their work. Finally, we return the final results from `result`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,457],"elapsed":5.230679533,"_type":"aimessage"}]
