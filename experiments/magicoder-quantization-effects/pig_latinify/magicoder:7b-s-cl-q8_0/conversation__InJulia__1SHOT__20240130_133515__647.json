Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example in Julia programming language of how you might implement this:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    @sync begin\n        for word in words\n            @spawn try \n                Threads.@spawn print(pig_latin(word))\n            catch e\n                println(\"Error: \", e)\n            end\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word::String)\n    vowel = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    word = replace(word, \" \" => \"\") # Remove spaces\n    if length(word) > 1 && isletter(word[1]) && !in([word[1]], vowel)\n        return \"$(word[2:end])$(word[1])ay\"\n    elseif length(word) > 1 && isletter(word[1]) && in([word[1]], vowel)\n        return \"$(word[2:end])$(word[1])ay\"\n    elseif length(word) == 1 && !in([word], vowel)\n        return \"$(word)ay\"\n    elseif length(word) == 1 && in([word], vowel)\n        return \"$(word)ay\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\npig_latinify(words)\n```\n\nThis would print the words translated into pig latin, each on a separate thread. The `pig_latin` function checks if a word starts with a vowel and moves that letter to the end of the word appending 'ay'. If it doesn't start with a vowel it takes the first consonant and moves it to the end of the word, appending 'ay'.\n\nPlease note: This example may not work perfectly for all inputs due to the complexities involved in pig latin translations. The logic might need more conditions or modifications depending on your specific needs.","status":200,"tokens":[0,480],"elapsed":5.375314892,"_type":"aimessage"}]
