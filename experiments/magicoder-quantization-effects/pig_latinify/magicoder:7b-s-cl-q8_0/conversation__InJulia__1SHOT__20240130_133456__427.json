Each transformation runs on its own thread, allowing multiple transformations to happen at once (this could speed up processing if there are many words). \n\nNote that this script assumes all the input words only contain alphabets. If the input contains punctuation or numbers, `first` and `rest` would not be correctly defined.\n\nAlso note that Python's GIL makes it inefficient to use threads for CPU-bound tasks like these, but if you have a multicore system and your vector is large enough, threads can speed up the process.\n\nFinally, remember that Python's threading library isn't suited for CPU-intensive tasks due to GIL (Global Interpreter Lock), which prevents true parallel processing. For true parallelism in Python you should use multiprocessing instead of threading or try using Cython with the `nogil` keyword.","status":200,"tokens":[0,458],"elapsed":5.125185143,"_type":"aimessage"}]
