It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nimport Base.Threads.@threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    @threads for word in words\n        println(pig_latin_word(word)) # this will print the transformed word to stdout\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_word(word)\n   first_letter = word[1]\n   rest_of_word = word[2:end]\n   return \"$(rest_of_word)$first_letteray\" # Pig Latin rule: move the initial consonant or consonant cluster to end and add 'ay'\nend\n```\nThis program first creates a function `pig_latinify` that accepts an array of strings. Then it uses `@threads` macro from Julia's Base package for parallel computation, which is equivalent to running the loop body on separate threads. The result will be printed to stdout for each word in the array.\n\nThen there's a helper function `pig_latin_word`, which applies the pig latin transformation rule to each word. It takes one word at a time and returns its transformed version according to the pig latin rule (moving the initial consonant or cluster of consonants to end and adding 'ay').\n\nPlease note that this code does not actually return anything, it just prints the results directly. If you want to collect all the results into an array or similar data structure, you'd need a different approach.","status":200,"tokens":[0,336],"elapsed":3.836546217,"_type":"aimessage"}]
