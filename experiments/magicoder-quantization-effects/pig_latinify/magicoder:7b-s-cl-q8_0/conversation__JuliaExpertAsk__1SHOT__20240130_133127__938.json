It uses Julia's Channel type to coordinate between threads. Each thread identifies itself by its id in `Threads.threadid()`. The `translate_word` function is then used to convert each word into pig latin.\n\nPlease note that this code needs to be run in Julia with the Threads package installed and enabled for it to work properly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,320],"elapsed":3.650618403,"_type":"aimessage"}]
