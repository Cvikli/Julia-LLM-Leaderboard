It handles the first word separately by calling the `piglatin_firstword` function and for other words it calls the `piglatin_otherwords` function.\n\nThe `piglatin_firstword` function pops off the first word from the list, adds \"ay\" to each word in the list (except the first), while the `piglatin_otherwords` function simply moves all letters from the second character to the start of the word. \n\nThe `@async` macro is used here to run each thread in parallel. The `@sync begin ... end` block ensures that we wait for all threads to finish before continuing with the rest of our code.\n\nFinally, the results are collected and returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,474],"elapsed":5.315016448,"_type":"aimessage"}]
