Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is an example of how you might do this in Julia using the Threads module:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)\n    threads = Threads.nthreads()  # get the number of available threads\n    \n    # Create a vector for each thread\n    splitStrings = [split(strings[i], \" \") for i in 1:length(strings)]\n\n    results = mapreduce((x)->pig_latin_thread(x, threads), vcat, splitStrings)\n\n    return join(results, \" \")\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_thread(words, threadID)\n    Threads.threadid() == threadID ? (return [pig_latin_word(w) for w in words]) : nothing\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_word(word)\n    # Assume the word has been split into its initial and rest parts\n    return word * \"ay\" \nend\n```\nThis code splits the input string vector `strings` into smaller vectors that will be processed by different threads. The function `pig_latinify` then calls `pig_latin_thread` with each of these subvectors, and uses `mapreduce` to concatenate all results from each thread (note that `vcat` is used as the reduce function).\n\nEach thread calls `pig_latin_word`, which translates a single word into pig latin.","status":200,"tokens":[0,332],"elapsed":3.79845459,"_type":"aimessage"}]
