[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

I can provide you with a sample `pig_latinify` function that operates on a vector of strings and applies pig latin transformation, but it won't be multithreaded:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strs::Vector{String})\n    Translator = Dict(\"a\" => \"ay\", \"e\" => \"ay\", \"i\" => \"ay\", \"o\" => \"ay\", \"u\" => \"ay\", \n                      \"b\" => \"oop\", \"c\" => \"owt\", \"d\" => \"ownk\", \"f\" => \"owst\", \"g\" => \"oung\", \n                      \"h\" => \"ooch\", \"j\" => \"owch\", \"k\" => \"awk\", \"l\" => \"elp\", \"m\" => \"am\", \n                      \"n\" => \"en\", \"p\" => \"app\", \"q\" => \"uack\", \"r\" => \"ar\", \"s\" => \"ayst\", \n                      \"t\" => \"at\", \"v\" => \"ov\", \"w\" => \"ow\", \"x\" => \"ax\", \"y\" => \"ay\", \"z\" => \"az\")\n\n    pig_latin_strs = map(str -> begin\n        words = split(str, ' ')\n        \n        # Iterate over the words in reverse order because we'll be popping them off.\n        for i in length(words):-1:1\n            word = lowercase(words[i])\n            \n            # Replace vowels with \"ay\" and move other characters to end of word\n            if haskey(Translator, word[1]) \n                words[i] *= Translator[word[1]]\n                \n                for c in word[2:end]\n                    pushfirst!(words[i], c)\n                end\n            end\n        end\n        \n        join(words, ' ')\n    end, strs)\n    \n    return pig_latin_strs\nend\n```\n\nIf you want to run this on multiple threads, Julia's built-in threading capabilities will allow you to do so:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strs::Vector{String})\n    # Create a channel for the results of each transformation\n    result = Channel{String}(length(strs))\n\n    @threads for str in strs\n        # Put each transformed string into the channel asynchronously\n        put!(result, pig_latinify_threaded(str))\n    end\n    \n    # Collect all the results from the channel\n    pig_latin_strs = collect(result)\n\n    return pig_latin_strs\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_threaded(str::String)\n    # ... same transformation logic as above, but in this function\n    # to be run on separate threads ...\nend\n```\n\nPlease provide the special instructions for a more specific solution.","status":200,"tokens":[0,711],"elapsed":8.063116827,"_type":"aimessage"}]
