It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    threads = [@spawn pig_latinify!(results, i, words[i]) for i in 1:length(words)]\n    wait(threads)\n    return results\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify!(result::Vector{String}, i::Int64, word::String)\n    result[i] = pig_latinify(word)\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(word::String)\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    rest_of_word = word[2:end]\n    \n    if islowercase(first_letter)\n        return string(rest_of_word, first_letter * \"ay\")\n    elseif isuppercase(first_letter)\n        return uppercase(string(rest_of_word, first_letter * \"ay\"))\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis code creates a `pig_latinify` function that accepts a vector of strings as input. This function then spawns multiple threads to process the words in parallel. Each thread calls the helper function `pig_latinify!`, which modifies a single result value in the shared results array.\n\nWhen creating each pig latin word, we check if the first letter is uppercase or lowercase and make appropriate modifications (uppercasing the word if it was originally uppercase). Finally, we return the transformed vector of words.","status":200,"tokens":[0,364],"elapsed":4.091931946,"_type":"aimessage"}]
