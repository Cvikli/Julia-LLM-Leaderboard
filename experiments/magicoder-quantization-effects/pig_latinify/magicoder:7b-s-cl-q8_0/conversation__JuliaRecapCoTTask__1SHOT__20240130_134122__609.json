[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It is used here to keep things simple and for testing purposes. \n\nIn a more advanced application, you might want to make `pig_latinify` return an array of transformed strings instead of printing them out directly, because printing them can lead to race conditions if we are dealing with multithreading. Also, the implementation above does not handle uppercase letters or punctuation that might appear in pig latin words. \n\nLastly, it's important to remember that threading has its own performance trade-offs and should only be used when necessary for a specific task. In this case, each string is being processed separately (which means there's no shared state between the threads), so threading would probably be overkill and might even slow down the code due to context switches. If you are dealing with huge amounts of data or more complex processing tasks, consider using threading.","status":200,"tokens":[11,354],"elapsed":4.065335184,"_type":"aimessage"}]
