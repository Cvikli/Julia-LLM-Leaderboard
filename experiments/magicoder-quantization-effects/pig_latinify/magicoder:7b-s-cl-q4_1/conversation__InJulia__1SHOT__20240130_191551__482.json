If a word starts with a vowel, just move the entire word to the end and add \"ay\".\n\nHere's how we can implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\n@everywhere function pig_latinify(word::String)\n    first_letter = string(word[1])\n    rest_of_word = word[2:end] * \"ay\"\n    if occursin(\"a\", first_letter) || occursin(\"e\", first_letter) || occursin(\"i\", first_letter) || occursin(\"o\", first_letter) || occursin(\"u\", first_letter)\n        return rest_of_word * first_letter * \"ay\"\n    else\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction main()\n    words = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n    push!(Distributed.workers(), Distributed.MyLocalProcess())\n    results = pmap(pig_latinify, words)\n    \n    for (i, word) in enumerate(words)\n        @info \"Pig Latin translation of $word is $(results[i])\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis script begins by defining the `pig_latinify` function which takes a single string and converts it to pig latin. It then creates a vector of strings that we want to convert to pig latin. We use `@everywhere` to ensure that this function definition is copied to all workers in our cluster, so each worker can independently process its part of the list of words.\n\nWe then call `pmap` on the `pig_latinify` function and pass it a vector of our strings. This will launch one task for every element in the input collection (a vector in this case) to be computed by each worker.\n\nFinally, we print out the results using `@info`. Note that we have used DistributedLib's `info` macro here instead of regular `println`, because it automatically prefixes the output with the worker name, which helps distinguish where each output came from in a cluster. \n\nNote: This code must be run on a multi-node machine (JULIA_PKGS__REQS=julia) and the workers should be running.","status":200,"tokens":[0,541],"elapsed":4.360963189,"_type":"aimessage"}]
