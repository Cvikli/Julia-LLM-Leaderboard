[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

You need to use Julia's multithreading capability and special instructions provided to you. \n\nThe Python-like pseudo code would look like this:\n```python\ndef pig_latinify(words):\n    with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:\n        futures = [executor.submit(pig_latin, word) for word in words]\n        \n        # For Python 3.9 and above, this would be a simple list comprehension. But for earlier versions, it's not possible to do it with list comprehension directly due to the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock). Hence, we need an explicit loop:\n        pig_latin_words = [future.result() for future in futures]\n    \n    return pig_latin_words\n```\n\nIn Julia, we can achieve similar functionality using `Threads.@spawn`. But as Julia doesn't have a built-in method to convert an iterator into a lazy iterator that could be used with Threads.jl like Python's concurrent.futures, it would not be able to leverage the multithreading capabilities as efficiently.\n\nHowever, we can use Julia's `pmap` function from Base:\n```julia\nusing Threads\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    result = Threads.@spawn map(words) do word \n        pig_latin(word)\n    end\n    return fetch(result)\nend\n```\nThis will create a new thread for each word in the vector, but due to some limitations in Julia, this is not as efficient as Python's concurrent.futures library. \n\nThe `pig_latin` function is not shown here because it would require additional information about how words are transformed into pig Latin.","status":200,"tokens":[0,430],"elapsed":3.481940604,"_type":"aimessage"}]
