The second function `create_words_array` converts the input string into an array of strings split by spaces. \n\nThe main function `pig_latinify` takes in an array of strings, creates a channel to store each translated word, then spawns a new thread for each worker which fetches a word from the channel and translates it using `pig_latinify`. The result is collected into an array and returned. \n\nPlease note that the `@everywhere` macro is used to make sure all workers have access to the function `pig_latinify` when we are calling this in a distributed manner.","status":200,"tokens":[0,536],"elapsed":4.313065609,"_type":"aimessage"}]
