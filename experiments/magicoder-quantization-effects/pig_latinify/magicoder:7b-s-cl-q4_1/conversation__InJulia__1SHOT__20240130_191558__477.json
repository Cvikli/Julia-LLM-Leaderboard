It uses the `@threads` macro from Julia's `Threads` standard library to handle multithreading for each transformation. \n\nThe `pig_latin` function is a helper function used to convert a single word into Pig Latin. It checks whether the first letter of the word is a vowel, and if so, it adds 'ay' after all letters except for the first one. If not, it simply appends 'ay' at the end. \n\nTo make sure this works correctly, you need to set the characters used as vowels. In the example, \"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", and \"u\" are considered as vowels. You can modify the `vowels` array according to your specific needs.","status":200,"tokens":[0,483],"elapsed":3.914662672,"_type":"aimessage"}]
