It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example solution in Julia using the Threads package:\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::AbstractVector{String})\n    results = Vector{Union{Missing, String}}(undef, length(strings)) # for storing results\n    @threads for i=1:length(strings)\n        string = strings[i]\n        word = split(string)[1]  # extract the first word\n        first_letter = word[1]\n        pig_latin = string * \"ay\"   # create Pig Latin word\n        if islowercase(first_letter)\n            results[i] = lowercase(pig_latin)\n        else\n            results[i] = uppercase(pig_latin)\n        end\n    end\n    return results\nend\n```\nThis function takes a vector of strings, creates an empty array for storing the transformed strings, and then iterates over each string. Each iteration is run in a separate thread. For each string, it extracts the first word, converts that word to Pig Latin by appending \"ay\", and stores the result back into the results array. \n\nThis function also handles capitalization correctly: if the original word started with a lowercase letter, the resulting Pig Latin word will also be in lowercase; otherwise, it will be uppercase. The transformed words are then returned in a vector.","status":200,"tokens":[0,314],"elapsed":2.504662451,"_type":"aimessage"}]
