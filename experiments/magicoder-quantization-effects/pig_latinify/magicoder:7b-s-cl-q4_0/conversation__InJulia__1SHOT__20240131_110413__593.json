It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    Threads.@threads for word in words\n        println(pig_latin(word))\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    if !('A' <= first_letter <= 'Z') && (first_letter in vowels)\n        return \"$wordway\"\n    elseif !('A' <= first_letter <= 'Z')\n        return \"$(word[2:end])ay$word[1]\"\n    else\n        return \"$(word[2:end])ay $word[1]\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `pig_latinify` that takes an array of words as input and applies the `pig_latin` function to each word in parallel using threads. The `pig_latin` function checks if the first letter is a vowel, or not. If it's a vowel, it appends \"way\" at the end of the word. If it's not a vowel, it puts all the letters after the first one and adds \"ay\" before the first letter.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\npig_latinify(words)\n```\n\nThis will print out the pig latin versions of each word in parallel, one per line.","status":200,"tokens":[0,375],"elapsed":2.800339411,"_type":"aimessage"}]
