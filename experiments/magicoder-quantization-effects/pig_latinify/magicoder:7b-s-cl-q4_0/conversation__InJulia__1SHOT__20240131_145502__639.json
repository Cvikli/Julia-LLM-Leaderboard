It applies the `latinfy` function to each string in parallel using multiple threads. The `latinfy` function takes a single string and transforms it into Pig Latin. \n\nThe `piglatin` function is applied to each word in the input string, converting it from English to Pig Latin. If the first letter of the word is uppercase, it'll capitalize the first letter of the transformed word; if not, it won't.","status":200,"tokens":[0,414],"elapsed":3.109762204,"_type":"aimessage"}]
