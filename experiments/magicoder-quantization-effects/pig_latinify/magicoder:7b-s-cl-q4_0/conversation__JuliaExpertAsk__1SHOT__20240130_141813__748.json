For each thread it calls `pig_latin_word`, which takes one word as input and transforms it into Pig Latin. \n\nIf the word is only one letter long, the function returns \"ay $word\", otherwise it returns \"$rest_of_worday $first_letteray\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,270],"elapsed":2.034898076,"_type":"aimessage"}]
