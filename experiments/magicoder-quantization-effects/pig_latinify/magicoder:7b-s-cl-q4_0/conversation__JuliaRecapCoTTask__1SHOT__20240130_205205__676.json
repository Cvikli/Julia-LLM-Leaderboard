[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The task requires writing a function that translates English text into Pig Latin, which is an artificial language game where words are moved to the end of sentence and sometimes prefixed with certain vowel sounds in order to create nonsensical phrases. This function will operate on each string within a vector concurrently using multiple threads, so it's ideal for heavy computational tasks or when parallel processing is needed.\n\nHere is an example implementation using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String}, instructions...)\n    # Create a pool of threads with length equal to the number of strings\n    threads = []\n    \n    @sync begin\n        for string in strings\n            push!(threads, @async begin\n                pig_latinified_string = \"\"\n                \n                # Split the input string into words\n                for word in split(string)\n                    if startswith(word, [\"a\",\"e\",\"i\",\"o\",\"u\", \"y\"])\n                        # If the first letter is a vowel, simply append 'ay' to it\n                        pig_latinified_string *= \"$worday \"\n                    else\n                        # If not, move all the letters before the first vowel and append 'ay' at the end of the word.\n                        first_vowel_index = findfirst(x->startswith(x, [\"a\",\"e\",\"i\",\"o\",\"u\", \"y\"]), word)\n                        \n                        if isnothing(first_vowel_index)  # If no vowels are found at the beginning of the word\n                            pig_latinified_string *= \"$worday \"\n                        else\n                            pig_latinified_string *= \"$(word[(first_vowel_index+1):end]ay $word[1:first_vowel_index]\"\n                        end\n                    end\n                end\n                return pig_latinified_string\n            end)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Collect the results from each thread\n    pig_latinified_strings = mapreduce(fetch, *, threads) do thd\n        fetch(thd).result\n    end\n    return join.(pig_latinified_strings, \" \")\nend\n```\nThis function uses `@async` macro to create new threads for each string in the input vector. The function `fetch` is used to wait for the thread to finish and retrieve its result. \n\nThe `mapreduce` function is used here to collect all the results from different threads. It applies the `*=` operator on each element of an array, similar to Python's reduce function.\n\nThis function assumes that words are separated by spaces in the input string. You may need to adjust it for other cases or rules if your requirements are more complex than this basic Pig Latin transformation rule. \n\nPlease note that due to global interpreter lock (GIL) present in Python, running multi-threading tasks in Python is generally slower compared to Julia or R which support true parallel computing without GIL.","status":200,"tokens":[0,680],"elapsed":5.252729768,"_type":"aimessage"}]
