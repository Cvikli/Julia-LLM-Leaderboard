It uses Julia's threading capabilities to run the transformations in parallel on different threads. The results are collected back into an array where each element is a tuple containing the original index and the transformed word.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_word` function takes a single string, splits it into words, transforms each one into pig latin by appending \"ay\" to the end of each word, then joins all the words back together into a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,411],"elapsed":3.084686285,"_type":"aimessage"}]
