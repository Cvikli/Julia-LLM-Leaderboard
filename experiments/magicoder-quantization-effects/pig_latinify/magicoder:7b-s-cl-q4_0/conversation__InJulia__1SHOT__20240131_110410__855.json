Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can use the `@spawnat` macro for running code in parallel on different threads. Here's how you could implement `pig_latinify`:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    results = @sync begin\n        for word in words\n            @async push!(results, pig_latin_word(word))\n        end\n        results\n    end\n    return results\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_word(word)\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    rest = word[2:end]\n    return \"$rest$first_letteray\"\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, `pig_latinify` takes a vector of words as input and returns a vector of the same length with each word transformed into pig latin. The `@sync begin ... end` construct is used to run the code within it on separate threads. Each iteration of the loop runs in its own thread thanks to the `@async push!(results, pig_latin_word(word))` line which schedules `pig_latin_word` to be run asynchronously and then adds the result (the transformed word) to the `results` array.\n\nThe `pig_latin_word` function takes a single word as input, transforms it into pig latin by appending the first letter of the word at the end followed by \"ay\", and returns this new string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,322],"elapsed":2.382722772,"_type":"aimessage"}]
