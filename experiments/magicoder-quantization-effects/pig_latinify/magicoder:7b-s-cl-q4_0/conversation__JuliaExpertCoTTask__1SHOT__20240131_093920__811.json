Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia code that implements this task:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    @threads for word in words\n        println(pig_latin(word))\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    if first_letter in vowels\n        return string(word, \"way\")\n    else\n        return string(word[2:end], first_letter, \"ay\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `pig_latinify` that takes an array of words and applies the `pig_latin` function to each word in parallel using threads. The `pig_latin` function checks if the first letter of the word is a vowel, if it is then it appends \"way\" to the end of the word otherwise it moves all the letters after the first one to the end and adds \"ay\".\n\nYou can call this function with your data like so:\n```julia\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,286],"elapsed":3.25289595,"_type":"aimessage"}]
