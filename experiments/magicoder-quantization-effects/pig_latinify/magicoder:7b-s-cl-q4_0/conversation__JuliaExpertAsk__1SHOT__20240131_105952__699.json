It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    Threads.@threads for word in words\n        println(\"Pig latinified version of $(word) is: \", pig_latin(word))\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word::String)\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    rest_of_word = word[2:end]\n    return \"$(rest_of_word)$(first_letter)ay\"\nend\n```\n\nIn this example, the `pig_latinify` function uses `@threads` macro from Julia's Base.Threads module to create a new thread for each iteration of the loop. The `pig_latin` function is used to convert each word into pig latin. \n\nPlease note that this code will print out the transformed words one by one, not all at once due to the use of threads. If you want to see them all at once, you can modify the loop like so:\n\n```julia\nThreads.@threads for word in words\n    println(\"Pig latinified version of $(word) is: \", pig_latin(word))\nend\n```\n\nThis will print out all transformed words at once.","status":200,"tokens":[0,304],"elapsed":2.275771491,"_type":"aimessage"}]
