It then iterates over each string in the input vector and applies the Pig Latin translation on separate threads. Once all the strings have been translated, it collects the results from the channel and returns them as an array of strings.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that all strings do not contain punctuation or special characters apart from spaces.","status":200,"tokens":[99,657],"elapsed":5.078805303,"_type":"aimessage"}]
