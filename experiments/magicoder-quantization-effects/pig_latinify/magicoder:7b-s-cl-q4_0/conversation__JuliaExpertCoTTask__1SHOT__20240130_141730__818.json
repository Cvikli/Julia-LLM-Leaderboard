It then creates and starts a separate thread for each string in the input list, collects all of these threads in a list, waits for them to finish with `join()`, and finally returns the Pig Latin translations produced by the individual threads.\n\nNote that the function `run()` inside class is executed when start() is called. Also, Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) will not be an issue as itâ€™s designed for multithreading but not multiprocessing.","status":200,"tokens":[0,336],"elapsed":2.493924528,"_type":"aimessage"}]
