The transformation is done in parallel by creating a new thread for each iteration.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function checks if the first letter of the word is a vowel or an uppercase letter (to handle words that start with an uppercase letter). If it's not, it moves the first two letters to the end and adds \"ay\". If it is, it simply adds \"way\" at the end.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that each word in the input string is separated by a space. If words are separated by other characters (like punctuation), you'll need to modify the `pig_latin` function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,481],"elapsed":3.618843513,"_type":"aimessage"}]
