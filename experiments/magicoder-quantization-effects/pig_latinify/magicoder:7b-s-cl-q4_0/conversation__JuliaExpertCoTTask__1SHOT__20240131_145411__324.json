It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia code for the `pig_latinify` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    \n    @threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        word = words[i]\n        first_letter = word[1]\n        \n        # Check if the word starts with a vowel\n        if occursin('a':'z', lowercase(first_letter)) && !occursin('aeiou', lowercase(first_letter))\n            result[i] = string(word, \"way\")\n        else \n            result[i] = string(word[2:end], first_letter * \"ay\")\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each word in the input vector, checking if it starts with a vowel (ignoring case), and if so, appending 'way' to it. If not, it moves all the letters after the first one to the end of the string and adds 'ay'. It uses `@threads` macro from `Base.Threads` package for multithreading, meaning it will run on separate threads in your CPU.\n\nNote: This code assumes that words are only made up of lowercase English alphabets and spaces.","status":200,"tokens":[0,315],"elapsed":2.392798623,"_type":"aimessage"}]
