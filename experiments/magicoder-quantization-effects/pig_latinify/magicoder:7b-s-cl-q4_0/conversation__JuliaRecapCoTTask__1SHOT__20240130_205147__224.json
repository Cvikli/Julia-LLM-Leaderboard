[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Within that block, we define a function `pig_latinify()` that takes in a vector of strings and returns nothing (it's meant to be a side effect), but it runs asynchronously using `@async`.\n\nFor each string in the input array, an asynchronous task is started to perform the pig latin transformation. This means that while `pig_latinify()` is running, it can continue on to the next string even if one of its threads is still busy.\n\nThe helper function `pig_latin()` takes a string and returns the pig latin version of it. It first splits the string into individual words, then transforms each word based on whether its first letter is lower case or upper case. The transformed words are then combined back together into a single string with spaces between them.\n\nIf there are specific instructions for this task, please provide them so that I can modify my solution accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,529],"elapsed":4.04719488,"_type":"aimessage"}]
