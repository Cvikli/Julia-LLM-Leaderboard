It then applies this transformation using the `foldxt` function from Transducers package in Julia, which is used for parallel reduction operations. The result is printed out at each iteration.\n\nNote: This example assumes that words are only consisted of lowercase English letters and spaces, and it doesn't handle punctuation or special characters properly. If you need to handle them, you would need a more complex function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,299],"elapsed":2.237672371,"_type":"aimessage"}]
