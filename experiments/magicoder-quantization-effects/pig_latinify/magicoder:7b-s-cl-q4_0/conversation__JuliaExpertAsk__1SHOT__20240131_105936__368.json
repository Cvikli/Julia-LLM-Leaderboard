It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads, String\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    @sync begin\n        for word in words\n            @async begin\n                println(pig_latin(word))\n            end\n        end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word)\n    vowels = [\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"]\n    first, rest = split(word, \"\") do c \n        !any(isequal(c), vowels) && isletter(c)\n    end\n    return \"$restay $firstay\"\nend\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- `pig_latinify` takes a vector of strings and uses `@sync begin ... @async end` to run each string transformation on a separate thread.\n- `pig_latin` is the function that transforms an individual word into pig latin. It splits the word at the first consonant it encounters, then reassembles it in pig latin format.\n\nPlease note that this code will print each transformed string on a separate line. If you want to collect all of them into one vector, you can modify `pig_latin` function to return the transformed word instead of printing it and then use `@async begin ... end` inside loop in `pig_latinify`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,325],"elapsed":2.446036879,"_type":"aimessage"}]
