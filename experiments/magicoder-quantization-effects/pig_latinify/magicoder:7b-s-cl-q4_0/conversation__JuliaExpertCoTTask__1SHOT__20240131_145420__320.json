The `pig_latin_word` function is called within the loop over each word, which applies the Pig Latin transformation by moving the first letter(s) to the end of the word and adding \"ay\".\n\nPlease note that you need Julia version 1.5 or higher for this script to work due to use of `@threads` macro.","status":200,"tokens":[0,264],"elapsed":1.989572172,"_type":"aimessage"}]
