It uses Julia's `@sync begin ... end` construct to run the translation on separate threads for each word in the input list. The translated strings are collected and returned as an array. \n\nFor example, if you call `pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])`, it will return `[\"elloHay\", \"appleAy\", \"strongOgray\", \"orldway\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,303],"elapsed":2.28931903,"_type":"aimessage"}]
