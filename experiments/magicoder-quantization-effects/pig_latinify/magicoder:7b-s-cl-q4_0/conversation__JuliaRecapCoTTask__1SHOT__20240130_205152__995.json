[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

For each word in words, it spawns a new thread using `@spawn`, which executes the `pig_latin` function on that word. The `@sync begin ... end` construct makes sure all threads have finished before we return from the top-level function.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function is another function that transforms each string into pig latin, based on whether it starts with \"con\". If it does, then we remove the first three characters and append \"ay\" to the end of the word; if not, we just add \"ay \" before the original first character.\n\nYou can use this like so:\n\n```julia\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"world\"])  # prints \"ellohay orldway\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,344],"elapsed":2.605330658,"_type":"aimessage"}]
