It uses `@sync begin ... @spawnat :any ... end` to run each transformation on a separate thread. The `pig_latin_transform` function is used to transform individual words into their pig latin equivalent.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the input strings contain only lowercase and uppercase English letters, and spaces as word separators. It doesn't handle punctuation or other special characters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,374],"elapsed":2.812879986,"_type":"aimessage"}]
