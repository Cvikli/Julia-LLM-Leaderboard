[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    @sync begin\n        for word in words\n            @async println(pig_latin(word))\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    if !('A' <= first_letter <= 'Z') && (first_letter in vowels)\n        return \"$(word)way\"\n    elseif !('A' <= first_letter <= 'Z')\n        return \"$(word[2:end])ay$(word[1])\"\n    else\n        return \"$(word[2:end])ay $(first_letter)\"\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function will take a vector of strings as input, and for each string it will spawn a new thread that prints the pig latin version of the word. The `pig_latin` helper function is used to convert an individual word into its pig latin form.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function first checks if the first letter of the input word is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u). If it is, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word and returns it. If not, it moves all letters in the word except for the first one to the end and adds \"ay\" followed by the first letter at the beginning of the string.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that words are only made up of lowercase alphabetic characters and spaces. It does not handle punctuation or uppercase letters correctly, but it should give you a good starting point for your task.","status":200,"tokens":[0,398],"elapsed":3.070916802,"_type":"aimessage"}]
