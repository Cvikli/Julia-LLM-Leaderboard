It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem in Julia using the Threads package for multi-threading:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)\n    @threads for string in strings\n        println(string * \"ay\")\n    end\nend\n\npig_latinify([\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"])\n```\nIn this code, the `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as input and uses `@threads for string in strings` to iterate over each string in parallel. For each string, it simply appends `\"ay\"` to form pig latin and prints the result. The Threads package is used to create multiple threads that can run concurrently. \n\nPlease note that this will print out the transformed strings, but if you want to store them in a new vector or do something else with them, you would need to modify this code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,208],"elapsed":1.548627569,"_type":"aimessage"}]
