Note that this is a very simple implementation of pig latin, it doesn't handle capital letters or punctuation correctly. It also doesn't return anything, it just prints to the console. If you want to actually return the transformed words, you would need to modify the function accordingly.\n\nAlso note that this code uses Julia's `Threads.@threads` macro for multithreading and Transducers.jl library for processing in parallel.","status":200,"tokens":[0,287],"elapsed":2.159655189,"_type":"aimessage"}]
