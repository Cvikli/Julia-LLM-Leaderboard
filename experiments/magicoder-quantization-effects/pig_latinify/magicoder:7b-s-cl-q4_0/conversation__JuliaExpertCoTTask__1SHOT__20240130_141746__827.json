Each thread calls `translate_to_pig_latin` to convert that string into Pig Latin. Note that we use `@sync begin ... @async Threads.spawn() do end` to ensure that all threads are joined together correctly, which is necessary if you're running more than one thread.\n\nThis `translate_to_pig_latin` function works by iterating over the characters of the word, checking whether they are letters or spaces. If it finds a letter followed by a space, then it adds \"ay\" to the end of the word. If it finds a non-letter character, then it checks for a vowel and if not, it adds \"way\" to the beginning of the string.\n\nIf you want to run this in the REPL or Jupyter Notebook, you may need to change the code a bit, as the `Distributed` package isn't included by default.","status":200,"tokens":[0,515],"elapsed":3.964413337,"_type":"aimessage"}]
