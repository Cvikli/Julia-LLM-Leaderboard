The `pig_latin` function translates an English word into Pig Latin. If the first letter of the word is a vowel, it simply adds \"way\" at the end. If not, it moves all consonants to the end and adds \"ay\".\n\nPlease note that this code might behave differently on different systems or versions due to multithreading behavior in Julia. Also, please be aware that multithreaded programming can be more complex than single-threaded programming, especially when dealing with IO operations like `println`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,353],"elapsed":2.659403597,"_type":"aimessage"}]
