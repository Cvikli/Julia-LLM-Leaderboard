You can do this using Pkg.add(\"Distributed\").\n\nHere is a code snippet of how you could accomplish this:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    @sync begin\n        for word in words\n            @async println(pig_latinify_single(word))\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_single(word)\n    # Pig Latin rules: \n    # - If a word begins with a vowel, add \"ay\" to the end.\n    # - If a word begins with a consonant, move the first letter(s) to the end and add \"ay\".\n    if startswith(word, ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'])\n        return \"$worday\"\n    else\n        return join([word[2:end], word[1], \"ay\"], \"\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\nYou can call this function as follows:\n\n```julia\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\n```\n\nThis will print out each translated word on a new line. If you want to collect and return all the words in an array, you could modify `pig_latinify` as follows:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    results = @distributed vcat for word in words\n        pig_latinify_single(word)\n    end\n    return results\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,384],"elapsed":2.94231587,"_type":"aimessage"}]
