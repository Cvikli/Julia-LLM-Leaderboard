[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses the `@sync begin ... @async end` syntax to run each transformation on a separate thread using Julia's multithreading capabilities. \n\nThe helper functions `pig_latin`, `pig_word` are used to apply the transformations. `pig_latin` splits the input string into words, then applies `pig_word` to each word. `pig_word` checks if a word's first character is uppercase or an underscore (to avoid transforming those characters), and if not it capitalizes the first letter of the word and appends \"ay\" at the end of the word.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nstrings = [\"hello\", \"world\"]\npig_latinify(strings)\n```\nThis will print out each string transformed into pig latin.","status":200,"tokens":[0,415],"elapsed":3.22345493,"_type":"aimessage"}]
