Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might implement this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\npig_latinify(strings::Vector{String}) = begin\n    @threads for str in strings\n        println(pig_latin_transform(str))\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_transform(str) \n    word, rest = split(str, ' ')\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    if first(word) in vowels || isempty(word)\n        \"$strway\"\n    else\n        \"$rest$worday\"\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this code, the `pig_latinify` function uses `@threads` to run each iteration of the loop on a separate thread. The string transformation is done by the helper function `pig_latin_transform`. If the first letter of the word is a vowel or the word is empty (no letters), it appends \"way\" to the end of the string. Otherwise, it moves the initial word to the end and adds \"ay\".\n\nHere's an example of how you might use this function:\n```julia\nstrings = [\"apple\", \"orange\", \"banana\"]\npig_latinify(strings)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,302],"elapsed":2.243814527,"_type":"aimessage"}]
