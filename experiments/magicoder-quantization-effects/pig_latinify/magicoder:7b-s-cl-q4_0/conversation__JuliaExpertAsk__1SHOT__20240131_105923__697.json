It uses Python's concurrent.futures module to execute the pig_latin function on each string in separate threads.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function checks if the first letter of a word is a vowel, and if it is, appends \"way\" to the end of the word. If not, it finds the first vowel in the word and moves all characters after that vowel to the beginning of the word, then adds \"ay\".","status":200,"tokens":[142,386],"elapsed":17.558924784,"_type":"aimessage"}]
