It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem using Python's concurrent.futures module:\n\n```python\nimport concurrent.futures\n\ndef pig_latinify(words):\n    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:\n        futures = {executor.submit(pig_latin, word) for word in words}\n        return [future.result() for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures)]\n\ndef pig_latin(word):\n    vowels = 'aeiou'\n    if word[0].lower() in vowels:\n        return word + \"way\"\n    else:\n        return word[1:] + word[0] + \"ay\"\n\nprint(pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]))\n```\n\nIn this code, `pig_latinify` creates a separate thread for each word in the list. The `pig_latin` function is applied to each word and returns the pig latin version of it. If the first letter of the word is a vowel, \"way\" is appended to the end of the word. Otherwise, the first letter is moved to the end of the word followed by \"ay\".\n\nPlease note that Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) may limit the performance benefits of multithreading in this case because the GIL is released when waiting for I/O operations but not when executing CPU-bound tasks. For a truly parallel solution, you might want to consider using multiprocessing instead.","status":200,"tokens":[0,364],"elapsed":3.737322648,"_type":"aimessage"}]
