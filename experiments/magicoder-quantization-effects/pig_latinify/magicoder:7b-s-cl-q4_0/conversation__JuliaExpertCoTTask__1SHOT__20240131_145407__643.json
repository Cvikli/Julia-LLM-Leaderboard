It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia code that solves this problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    @sync for word in words\n        @async println(pig_latin_word(word))\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_word(word::AbstractString)\n    vowels = [\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"]\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    if !(first_letter in vowels)\n        return string(word, \",ay\")\n    else\n        return string(word[2:end], word[1], \",ay\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\nYou can call this function with the vector of strings as an argument like so:\n\n```julia\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\n```\n\nThis code works by defining a `pig_latin_word` function that converts a word to pig latin. This function checks whether the first letter of the word is a vowel and, if it isn't, appends \",ay\" to the end of the word. If the first letter is a vowel, it moves all the letters after the first one to the beginning of the string and then adds \",ay\".\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function uses `@sync for ... @async` to iterate over each word in the input vector on separate threads. Each thread calls `pig_latin_word` with a different word from the vector, prints out the result, and then exits. The `@sync` ensures that all of these operations happen simultaneously.","status":200,"tokens":[230,369],"elapsed":7.051120748,"_type":"aimessage"}]
