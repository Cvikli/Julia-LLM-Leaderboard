[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    Threads.@threads for word in words\n        println(pig_latin(word))\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word::AbstractString)\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    rest = word[2:end]\n    return \"$restay $first_letteray\"\nend\n```\nIn this code, the `pig_latinify` function uses `@threads` to create a new thread for each iteration of the loop. The `pig_latin` function is used inside the loop to transform each word into pig latin. \n\nThe `pig_latin` function works by taking the first letter of the word and appending it at the end of the rest of the word, with a space in between. For example, \"apple\" would become \"appleay\".\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\npig_latinify(words)\n```\nThis will print out the pig latin versions of each word on separate lines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,278],"elapsed":2.143389558,"_type":"aimessage"}]
