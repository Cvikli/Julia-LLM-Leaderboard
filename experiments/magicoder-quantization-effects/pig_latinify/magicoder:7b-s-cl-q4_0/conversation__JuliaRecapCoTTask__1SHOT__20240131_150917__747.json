X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It then uses `@sync for` to iterate over each string in the input vector and run it through the `pig_latin` function in an asynchronous manner using `@async`. The output will be printed out as each word is processed by the `pig_latin` function.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function takes a single string as input, removes the first letter of the word and returns it appended at the end of the rest of the word followed by \"ay\". This is the standard pig latin transformation rule. \n\nIf you need to use specific threads for each iteration, you can use `Threads.@threads` instead of `@sync`. However, note that this will not provide any performance benefit if only a few strings are being transformed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,300],"elapsed":2.306053392,"_type":"aimessage"}]
