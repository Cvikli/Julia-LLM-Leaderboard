It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Python solution for your problem:\n\n```python\nimport concurrent.futures\nimport re\n\ndef pig_latinify(words):\n    translator = str.maketrans('aeiouAEIOU', 'eiouaEIOUA')\n    vowels = 'aeiou'\n    \n    def transform(word):\n        first, *rest = word.lower().translate(translator).split()\n        \n        if first[0] not in vowels:\n            return f\"{first[1:]}{first[0]}ay{''.join(rest)}\"\n        else:\n            return f\"{first}ay{''.join(rest)}\"\n    \n    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:\n        return list(executor.map(transform, words))\n```\n\nThis function `pig_latinify` takes a vector of strings and applies the Pig Latin transformation to each string in parallel using Python's threading library. \n\nThe function `transform` is defined inside `pig_latinify` to apply the Pig Latin transformation to a single word. It checks if the first letter of the word is a vowel, and if not, it moves the initial consonant to the end of the word and adds 'ay'. If the first letter is a vowel, it just adds 'ay' at the end of the word.\n\nThe `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` context manager starts a thread pool and automatically shuts down when the block exits. The `map` function applies the `transform` function to each string in the input list, and returns an iterable of transformed strings. \n\nFinally, we convert this iterable into a list using the `list()` function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,400],"elapsed":3.021200465,"_type":"aimessage"}]
