The `pig_latin` function takes in a single string, splits it into words, and then for each word checks if the first letter is uppercase or lowercase. If it's lowercase it appends \"ay\" at the end of the word, if it's uppercase it appends \"AY\" at the end of the word. The transformed string is then printed to stdout.","status":200,"tokens":[0,346],"elapsed":2.601033523,"_type":"aimessage"}]
