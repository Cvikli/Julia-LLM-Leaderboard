The `pig_latinify` function is used as a helper function and takes two arguments: the word being transformed, and its index within the list of words (used to decide whether to add 'ay' at the end or not).\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```python\nwords = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\nprint(transform(words))  # prints ['applay', 'ananabay', 'errychay']\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,270],"elapsed":2.021090815,"_type":"aimessage"}]
