[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The function `pig_latinify` creates a channel to pass the transformed strings back and starts a separate thread for each string in the input vector. Each thread calls the `pig_latinify` function on its respective string, then puts the result onto the channel. After all threads have finished, it collects the results from the channel into an array and returns it. The `pig_latinify` function itself transforms a single string into pig latin by checking if the first letter of each word is a vowel or not. If it's a vowel, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word; otherwise, it moves all letters after the first one to the end of the word and adds \"ay\". It then joins all transformed words with spaces in between and returns this as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,579],"elapsed":4.536346982,"_type":"aimessage"}]
