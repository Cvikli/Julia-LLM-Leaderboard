Inside the function, we use Julia's `@threads` macro to create separate threads for each word in the array. Each thread then transforms and prints the corresponding word to pig latin (i.e., adding \"ay\" at the end of every word).\n\nPlease note that you need to replace `println(\"$worday\")` with your actual Pig Latin transformation logic.","status":200,"tokens":[0,215],"elapsed":1.61451183,"_type":"aimessage"}]
