[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It checks if the first letter of a word is a vowel, if so it appends \"way\" to the end of the word otherwise it adds \"ay\" to all letters in the word except for the last one and then appends \"-\" followed by the last letter and \"ay\". The result is printed out.\n\nPlease note that this function does not handle punctuation or multiple spaces correctly, so you might need to preprocess your input strings accordingly.\n\nAlso, please be aware that Julia's Threads.@threads macro creates a new task for each iteration of the loop, which can slow down the program if there are too many tasks. It is recommended to use this macro only in small scripts or notebooks. For larger codebases, consider using other parallel processing libraries like Distributed, or manually creating threads with Threads.@spawn.","status":200,"tokens":[0,587],"elapsed":4.592080168,"_type":"aimessage"}]
