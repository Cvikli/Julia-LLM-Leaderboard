It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example in Julia:\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(str_vec::Vector{String})\n    @sync begin\n        for str in str_vec\n            Threads.@spawn println(pig_latinify_word(str))\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_word(word)\n    if islowercase(word[1])\n        return string(word[2:end], word[1], \"ay\")\n    elseif isuppercase(word[1])\n        return uppercase(string(word[2:end], word[1], \"ay\"))\n    end\n    return word\nend\n```\nThis script defines a `pig_latinify` function that takes in a vector of strings. The `@sync begin ... end` block starts synchronization for the threads we're about to create with `@spawn`. For each string in the input vector, it creates a new thread using `@spawn` and then prints out the transformed word within this thread.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_word` function translates an English word into Pig Latin by moving the first letter to the end of the word and adding \"ay\". If the first letter is uppercase, it remains uppercase in the transformed word.\n  \nPlease note that this script will not run in the Julia REPL because it does not return any value. For testing purposes, consider using a Jupyter notebook or some other environment where you can easily test and verify the output of your code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,350],"elapsed":2.613935756,"_type":"aimessage"}]
