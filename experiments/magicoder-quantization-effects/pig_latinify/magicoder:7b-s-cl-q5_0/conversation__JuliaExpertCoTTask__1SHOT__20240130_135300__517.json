For each word in input array, an anonymous function is created and launched asynchronously using `@async`. Each async task simply prints the pig latin version of a given string (`word`).\n\nThis solution will print: \n```\nellohay\napplle_ay\nstrong_ay\norldway\n```","status":200,"tokens":[230,180],"elapsed":3.25526076,"_type":"aimessage"}]
