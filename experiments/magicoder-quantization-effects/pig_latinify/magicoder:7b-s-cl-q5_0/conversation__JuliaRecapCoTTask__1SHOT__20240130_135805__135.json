[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a basic implementation for the task, which includes handling special instructions:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String}; parallel = false, instructions...)\n    if parallel\n        threads = nthreads()\n        Threads.nthreads(1)  # We need to do this because we're going to modify the global state of Julia's threading system\n        result = pmap((w)->pig_latinify([w]; instructions...), words)\n        Threads.nthreads(threads)  # Restore the original number of threads\n    else\n        if length(instructions) > 0\n            println(\"The special instructions are not implemented for non-parallel execution.\")\n        end\n        result = map((w)->pig_latinify([w]; instructions...), words)\n    end\n    return result\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String}; vowel_rule=true, prefix=\"ay\")\n    function startswithvowel(s)\n        v = uppercase(first(s)) in 'AEIOU' ? true : false\n        vowel_rule ? v : !v\n    end\n    \n    map(w -> startswithvowel(w) ? \"$(w)$prefix\" : \"$(last(w))$prefix $(sub(w, 1:length(w)-1))\", words)\nend\n```\n\nThis function will transform each string in the input vector into pig latin. If you pass `true` as the argument to `vowel_rule`, it treats a word starting with a vowel as having \"ay\" appended instead of moving the first letter to the end of the word and then appending \"ay\".\n\nYou can also modify this function by passing special instructions, like changing how words are transformed or what rules apply. However, be aware that these instructions are not implemented for non-parallel execution.","status":200,"tokens":[0,427],"elapsed":3.768059061,"_type":"aimessage"}]
