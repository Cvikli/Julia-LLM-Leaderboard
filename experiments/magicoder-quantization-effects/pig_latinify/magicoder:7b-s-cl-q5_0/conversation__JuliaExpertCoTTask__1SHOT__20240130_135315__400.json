It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you could implement `pig_latinify` in Julia:\n\n```julia\nimport Base.Threads.@threads\nimport Base: split, capitalize, join\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strs)\n    @threads for str in strs\n        str = replace(uppercasefirst(split(str)[1]), 'A' => 'a') * \"ay\"\n        println(capitalize(str))\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this function, we use the `@threads` macro to parallelize the operation over each string in the input vector. For each string `str`, it first splits it into words (assuming that words are separated by spaces), then changes the first letter of the word to lowercase and appends \"ay\" to the end of it, effectively converting the string to pig latin.\n\nNote: This is a simple example and won't work for all cases - you might need to add more code to handle words that start with vowels (other than 'a'), and other special cases like punctuation or multiple spaces in between words.","status":200,"tokens":[0,244],"elapsed":2.103635295,"_type":"aimessage"}]
