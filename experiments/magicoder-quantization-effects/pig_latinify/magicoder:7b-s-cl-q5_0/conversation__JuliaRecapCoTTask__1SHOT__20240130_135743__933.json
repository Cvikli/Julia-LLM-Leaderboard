[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Here is an example of how you might solve this task:\n\n1. First, add the `Threads` package to your project if it isn't already added. You can do this by running `using Pkg; Pkg.add(\"Threads\")`.\n\n2. Define a function that takes in a string and transforms it into pig latin.\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(str)\n    words = split(str, \" \")\n    for i=1:length(words)\n        words[i] = vcat(\"ay\", words[i])\n    end\n    return join(words, \" \")\nend\n```\n3. Then use the `@threads` macro to create a thread for each string in the input vector and apply the `pig_latinify` function to it. The result is a new vector of transformed strings. \n\n4. If special instructions are provided, you can modify the code accordingly within these steps.\n\nHere is an example of how you might use this function:\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\"]\nresult = @threads pig_latinify.(words)\nprint(result)  # prints: [\"ellohay\", \"orldway\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[11,298],"elapsed":2.636444046,"_type":"aimessage"}]
