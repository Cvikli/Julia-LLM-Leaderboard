Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example using Julia's Base.Threads for multi-threading:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    function latyfy(str)\n        first, rest = split(str, \" \")\n        return \"$restay $firstay\"\n    end\n    \n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(strings))\n    @threads for i in 1:length(strings)\n        result[i] = latyfy(strings[i])\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\nIn this function `pig_latinify`, we split each string by spaces and store the first word in a variable called `first`. We then create a new pig-latin version of the string by concatenating the rest of the words with \"ay\" appended to them. The resulting pig-latin strings are stored in an array.\n\nWe then run the transformation on each string using multiple threads, storing the results in another array `result`. The function finally returns this array.","status":200,"tokens":[0,245],"elapsed":2.104142372,"_type":"aimessage"}]
