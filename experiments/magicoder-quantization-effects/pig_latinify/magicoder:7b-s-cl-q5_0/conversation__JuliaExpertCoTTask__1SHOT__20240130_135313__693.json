Then it uses `pmap()` from Distributed to apply this function concurrently across multiple workers (threads). Each worker takes an element of the input list and applies the function to transform it into pig latin. The result is a new vector where each word in each string has been transformed into pig latin.\n\nTo test our function with your data, we can call `pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])`. Note that this will return an array of strings where the words have been translated to pig latin.","status":200,"tokens":[0,311],"elapsed":2.718849367,"_type":"aimessage"}]
