It creates a new thread for each iteration and pushes each result to `results` array.\n2. `pig_latinify` function takes a string, splits it into words, then checks if the first letter is a vowel or not. If it is a vowel, it appends 'ay' at the end of word, otherwise it moves the first letters to the end and append 'ay'. Finally, it joins all transformed words back together into a string and returns that string.\n3. `Threads.@threads for i=1:length(strings)` is used for parallel execution across multiple threads.\n4. `num_threads = Threads.nthreads()` gives the number of threads available on your CPU, which is used to limit the number of threads if you want to avoid overloading your system.","status":200,"tokens":[0,529],"elapsed":4.558744329,"_type":"aimessage"}]
