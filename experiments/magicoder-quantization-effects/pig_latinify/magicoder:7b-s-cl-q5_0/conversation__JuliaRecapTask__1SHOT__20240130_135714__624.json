[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, we can leverage the `Base.Threads` library for multi-threading capabilities. Here's how you could implement such a task:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    function convertToPigLatin(word)\n        if lowercase(word)[1] âˆˆ vowels\n            word * \"ay\"\n        else\n            m = match(r\"^([bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz]+)(.*)$\", word)\n            isnothing(m) && return \"\"\n            return \"$(m.captures[1])ay $(m.captures[2]\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    return [convertToPigLatin(word) for word in words]\nend\n\nfunction threaded_pig_latinify(words)\n    @threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        words[i] = pig_latinify(words)[i]\n    end\n    \n    return words\nend\n```\nIn this code, `pig_latinify` is the function that transforms a word into its Pig Latin form. It takes advantage of the `@threads` macro to run in parallel across multiple threads, thus significantly speeding up the process of converting all the words in the input list.\n\nNote: Please make sure you have the necessary permissions to use this in your environment due to multi-threading capabilities.","status":200,"tokens":[0,344],"elapsed":3.01499178,"_type":"aimessage"}]
