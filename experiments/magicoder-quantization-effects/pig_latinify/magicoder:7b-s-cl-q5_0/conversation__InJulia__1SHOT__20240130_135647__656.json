This allows us to leverage multiple CPU cores for our computation. The progress function is used to display the progress of transformation. \n\nPlease note that you must have Julia installed in your system and you must have at least two CPUs or one CPU with Hyper-Threading enabled because we are creating two new worker processes.","status":200,"tokens":[0,580],"elapsed":5.004850929,"_type":"aimessage"}]
