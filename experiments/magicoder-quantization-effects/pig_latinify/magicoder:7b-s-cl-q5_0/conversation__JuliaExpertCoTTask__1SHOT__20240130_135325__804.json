Here is an example implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    return [pig_latinify(word) for word in words]\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(word::String)\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    if 'a' <= first_letter && first_letter <= 'z'\n        vowel = false\n    elseif 'A' <= first_letter && first_letter <= 'Z'\n        vowel = true\n    end\n\n    if vowel\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        return string(word[2:end] * word[1], \"ay\")\n    end\nend\n\nThreads.threads() # Number of active threads in Julia\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\n```\n\nIn this code, the function `pig_latinify` is defined to take a vector of strings and return a new vector where each string has been transformed into pig latin. The actual transformation is performed by the inner function `pig_latinify`.\n\nThe `Threads.threads()` call returns the number of active threads currently running in Julia, which should be 1 if you're not using multithreading (which is the default). You can change this value with `Threads.nthreads()`.\n\nIn the end, when you run `pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])`, it will return `[\"elloHay\", \"appleway\", \"rongstray\", \"orldway\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,397],"elapsed":3.44409808,"_type":"aimessage"}]
