Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's how you could implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\n@everywhere function pig_latinify(str::String)\n    words = split(str, \" \")\n    translated = \"\"\n    for word in words\n        firstletter = word[1]\n        restofword = word[2:end]\n        translated *= \"$restofword$firstletteray\" * \" \"\n    end\n    return translated[1:end-1] # remove the trailing space\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    jobs = map(p -> @spawn pig_latinify(p), strings)\n    \n    results = fetch.(jobs)\n    return results\nend\n```\n\nIn this example, `@everywhere function pig_latinify(str::String)` is used to define the `pig_latinify` function that will be run on every worker process.\n\nThe main function `function pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})` creates a job for each string in strings, and then uses `@spawn` to create these jobs, and finally fetches the results with `fetch.(jobs)`.\n\nPlease note that this will not run any faster than single threaded version due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in python. For CPU-bound tasks like this one, you'll want to consider using a language better suited for multi-threading or distributed computing such as C/C++ or Rust.","status":200,"tokens":[0,347],"elapsed":2.963122667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
