[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    @sync begin\n        for word in words\n            @async print(pig_latin(word))\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word::AbstractString) \n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    if lowercase(first(word)) in vowels\n        \"way $(word)\"\n    else\n        rest, first_letter = split(word, \"\")\n        \"$(rest)$(first_letteray)\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nHere `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as input. It uses `@sync begin ... end` to manage asynchronous tasks in Julia. The string is then transformed by the `pig_latin` function. \n\nIn this version, each transformation is done on a separate thread using `@async`. This allows for parallel processing and increased speed with long vectors of words. \n\nThis is just a simple example of how you might solve this task in Julia, there are other ways to do it as well depending on your needs or the specific instructions you were given.","status":200,"tokens":[0,279],"elapsed":2.165270477,"_type":"aimessage"}]
