It converts the English language to Pig Latin as described in the problem description. If the first letter of the word is a vowel or 'y' (as in \"year\"), it simply adds \"ay\" to the end of the word. Otherwise, it moves the initial consonant cluster to the end of the word and appends \"ay\".\n\nNote: This solution assumes that words are only made up of letters and no other special characters or symbols, so the program does not account for those cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,497],"elapsed":3.946953501,"_type":"aimessage"}]
