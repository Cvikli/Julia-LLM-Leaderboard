[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could implement this in Julia:\n```julia\nimport Base.Threads.@threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    @threads for word in words\n        word = lowercase(word) # Convert the word to lower case\n        first_letter = word[1] # Get the first letter of the word\n        \n        if islowercase(first_letter) \n            pig_latin = string(word[2:end], first_letter, \"ay\") # Move all letters after first to end and add 'ay' at the beginning\n            println(pig_latin)\n        else\n            pig_latin = string(word[2:end], lowercase(first_letter), \"ay\") # Same but capitalize the first letter\n            println(pig_latin)\n        end\n    end\nend\n``` \nThis function uses `@threads` from the `Base.Threads` package to start multiple threads, each of which will work on a separate string in the vector `words`. For each string, it converts all letters to lower case and checks if the first letter is uppercase or not. If it's uppercase, it capitalizes the first letter after moving all remaining characters at the end of the word. If it's lowercase, it leaves it as it is.\n\nNote: This function assumes that every string in `words` consists only of alphabetic characters and does not contain any punctuation or spaces. If there are other requirements for this task, you would need to adjust the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,355],"elapsed":2.765162523,"_type":"aimessage"}]
