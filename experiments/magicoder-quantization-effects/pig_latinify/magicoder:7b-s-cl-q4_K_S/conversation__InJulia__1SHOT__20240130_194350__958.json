Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might write the function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n@everywhere using PooledArrays\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::AbstractVector{<:AbstractString})\n    @distributed words pig_latin() do word::AbstractString\n        return pig_latin(word)\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word::AbstractString)\n    first_letter = first(word)\n    if islowercase(first_letter)\n       return string(word[2:end]*first_letter, word[1], 'ay')\n    elseif isuppercase(first_letter)\n        return uppercase(string(word[2:end]*lowercase(first_letter), lowercase(first(word)))) * 'AY'\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis code first defines a function `pig_latinify` that uses `@distributed` to apply the `pig_latin` transformation in parallel. The `pig_latin` function takes a string and transforms it into pig latin by adding 'ay' after the first letter of the word, moving any subsequent letters to the end of the word, and capitalizing the result if the original word was capitalized.\n\nNote: `@everywhere` is used to ensure that `PooledArrays` module is available in each worker process where the computation will be performed.\n\nIn order to run this code, you may need to have Julia installed along with PooledArrays package and Distributed library. \nPlease install these packages if not already done by using:\n```julia\nPkg.add(\"Distributed\")\nPkg.add(\"PooledArrays\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[103,394],"elapsed":29.343885384,"_type":"aimessage"}]
