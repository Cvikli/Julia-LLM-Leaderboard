Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\n# Define the pig_latinify function\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    @sync begin\n        for string in strings\n            @async println(\"$(pig_latin_word(string))\")\n        end\n    end\nend\n\n# Define the pig_latin_word function\nfunction pig_latin_word(s::AbstractString) \n    v = collect(lowercase(s))\n    c = findfirst(isequal('a'), v) - 1\n    if !isnothing(c)\n        return string(v[end-c+1:end]..., s[1:(end-c)]...) * \"ay\"\n    else\n        return \"$(s)ay\"\n    end\nend\n```\nPlease note that the code above is a simple example and will not run in multi-threaded mode because it does not involve any I/O operations or complex computations. If you want to see multi-threading effect, consider using Distributed package and IO operation inside your threads.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that multi-threading can be an overkill for simple tasks like this one. Julia is not really optimized for parallel computing on single machine, so it's better to use other languages designed for such a purpose (e.g., Python with multiprocessing module).","status":200,"tokens":[0,325],"elapsed":2.510754502,"_type":"aimessage"}]
