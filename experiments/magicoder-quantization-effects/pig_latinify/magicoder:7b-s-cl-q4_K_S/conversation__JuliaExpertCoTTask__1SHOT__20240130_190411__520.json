For each word in this array it spawns a new thread to translate that word into pig latin. Inside the `translate_word` helper function, it checks if the first letter is a vowel or not. If yes then it appends \"ay\" to the end of the rest of the word and converts it into uppercase else it moves the first letter to the end and append \"ay\". This is done in each thread resulting in translating the words concurrently. The `Threads.@threads` macro ensures that all threads are joined when the function completes execution, preventing any potential race conditions.","status":200,"tokens":[0,312],"elapsed":2.451971968,"_type":"aimessage"}]
