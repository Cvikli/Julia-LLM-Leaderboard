It maps each word in the input list to be translated by the `pig_latinate` function. The translations are returned as a list of strings.\n\nThe `pig_latinate` function checks if the first letter is a vowel, and if it is, appends \"way\" to create pig latin, otherwise, it moves the first letter to the end and append \"ay\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,250],"elapsed":1.927804853,"_type":"aimessage"}]
