Then, it maps each string to its pig latin version using the function `pig_latin`, which appends the first letter of the word to the end and concatenates the rest of the words. The resulting vectors are then printed out in order.\n\nNote that `@distributed` and `@__dot__` are internal functions used for distributed computing, which should not be manually called by users. \nThe `pmap()` function is a built-in function in Julia to apply a function (first argument) onto an iterable collection of arguments (second argument). The result is a vector with the results from each computation on separate threads.","status":200,"tokens":[0,323],"elapsed":2.540114856,"_type":"aimessage"}]
