The `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor()` creates a pool of worker threads, and we submit each word in the list to be transformed by our `pig_latinify` function. \n\nFinally, we print out the result of each transformation as it is completed. \n\nPlease note that Python is not Julia but Pig Latin rules are the same in both languages. Also please replace 'words' with your actual vector of strings to be transformed into Pig Latin.","status":200,"tokens":[142,359],"elapsed":16.003132991,"_type":"aimessage"}]
