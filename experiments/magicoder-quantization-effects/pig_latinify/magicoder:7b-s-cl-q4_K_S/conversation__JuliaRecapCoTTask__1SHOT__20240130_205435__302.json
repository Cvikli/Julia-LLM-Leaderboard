[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I can help with that! Here's an example implementation using Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed; addprocs() # adds workers to the cluster (for parallel computing)\n@everywhere using SharedArrays # needed for Shared Arrays to communicate between processes\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::SharedArray{<:AbstractString,1})\n    @sync begin \n        for i in eachindex(words)\n            @async words[i] = pig_latin(words[i])\n        end\n    end\n    return words\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word::AbstractString)\n    # transforms the word to pig latin\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    if !startswith(lowercase(word), vowels) \n        return \"$(word[2:end])ay\"\n    else \n        return \"$(word)way\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis code defines the function `pig_latinify` which transforms a vector of strings to pig latin using parallel computing. It uses the `@async` macro to asynchronously evaluate expressions in different threads, and `@sync` to synchronize the order of evaluation.\n\nThe inner function `pig_latin` is used to convert an individual word into its pig latin equivalent. It checks if the first letter of the string is a vowel (and doesn't change it), or not (and moves it two positions to the end and adds \"ay\").\n\nPlease note that this code requires Julia 1.6+ due to the use of `@async` macro, `SharedArrays`, and `@sync`. \n\nIn order to actually run these functions with your vector, you would call:\n```julia\nwords = SharedArray{String}(undef, length(your_vector))\nfill!(words, your_vector)\npig_latinified_words = pig_latinify(words)\n```\nThe SharedArray is necessary for the parallel computation, and you must ensure that `your_vector` is large enough to fully utilize all of the available CPU cores.","status":200,"tokens":[0,487],"elapsed":3.806323898,"_type":"aimessage"}]
