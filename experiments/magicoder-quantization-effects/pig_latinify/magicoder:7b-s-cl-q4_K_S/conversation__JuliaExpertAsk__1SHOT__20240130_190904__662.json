The `println` function is used to print out each transformed word, but you could replace this with any operation that transforms and returns the string.\n\nNote: For running multiple threads in Julia, you need to have package `Distributed` installed. If it's not installed then run `]add Distributed` in your console.","status":200,"tokens":[0,182],"elapsed":1.419514562,"_type":"aimessage"}]
