[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

If you are using a version of Julia earlier than 1.6, the `@distributed` macro can be used instead.\n\nThis solution uses multithreading (also known as parallel computing) via the `Distributed` package in Julia, which allows separate threads of execution within one process. The `@distributed` macro is used to specify that the computation should take place on a different thread than the current one.\n\nThe `@everywhere` and `@distributed` macros are needed here because they allow us to make the function `pig_latinify()` available for use on all workers, which means we can run it in parallel across multiple threads.","status":200,"tokens":[0,351],"elapsed":2.737289038,"_type":"aimessage"}]
