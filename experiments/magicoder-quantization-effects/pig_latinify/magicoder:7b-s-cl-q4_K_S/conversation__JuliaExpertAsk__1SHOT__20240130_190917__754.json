Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    @threads for word in words\n        println(translate_word(word))\n    end\nend\n\nfunction translate_word(word)\n    if length(word) > 1 && isletter(word[1])\n        firstchar = word[1]\n        rest = word[2:end]\n        return string(rest, firstchar * \"ay\")\n    else\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `pig_latinify` that takes as input a vector of strings and uses `@threads` to create separate threads for each iteration. Each thread calls the helper function `translate_word` which transforms a single word into pig latin.\n\nThe `isletter` function checks if the first character in the string is alphabetic, while `length` returns the number of characters in the string. The `string` function concatenates strings together.\n\nIn case your words vector contains non-alphabetic characters (like numbers or punctuation) or empty strings, you need to adjust this solution accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,273],"elapsed":2.10715226,"_type":"aimessage"}]
