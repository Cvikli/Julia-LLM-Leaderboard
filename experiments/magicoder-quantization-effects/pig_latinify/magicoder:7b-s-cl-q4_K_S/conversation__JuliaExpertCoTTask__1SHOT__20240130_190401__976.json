Inside the for loop, each word is transformed using our helper function `pig_latin_transformer`. \n\nThe `pig_latin_transformer` function checks if the first letter of the word is a vowel or not. If it's a vowel, we just append \"way\" to the end of the word. If it's not a vowel, we move all letters after the first one and then append them at the start of the word followed by \"ay\".","status":200,"tokens":[230,293],"elapsed":14.187318997,"_type":"aimessage"}]
