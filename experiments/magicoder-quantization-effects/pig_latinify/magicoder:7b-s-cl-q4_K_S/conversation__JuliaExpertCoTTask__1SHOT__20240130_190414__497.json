Each word's transformation is performed by a nested helper function `pig_latin_word`. This nested function uses Julia's built-in threading capabilities to process each word in its own thread.\n\nThis code will correctly transform your example list of words into: \"ellohay appleyay ongrongstray orldway\". Please note that this implementation does not handle punctuation and capital letters, as Pig Latin is traditionally only applied to lowercase English words.","status":200,"tokens":[0,342],"elapsed":2.693188191,"_type":"aimessage"}]
