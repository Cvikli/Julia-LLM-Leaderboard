It uses `@threads` macro to create threads for each word in the input vector. The `pig_latin_word` function takes a string as an argument and returns the pig latin version of it.\n\nThe basic idea behind pig latin is to move the first letter(s) to the end of the word, followed by \"ay\". For example: 'apple' in pig-latin becomes 'appleay'.","status":200,"tokens":[0,233],"elapsed":4.014859527,"_type":"aimessage"}]
