It checks if the first letter of the word is a vowel; if it is, it appends \"ay\" to the end of the rest of the word and prepends it with the rest of the word (without the first letter). If the first letter is not a vowel, it follows the same process but also moves the first consonant cluster to the end.\n\nPlease note that this version of pig latin doesn't distinguish between upper-case and lower-case letters. Also, it considers \"qu\" as one consonant for the purpose of moving it to the end of the word.","status":200,"tokens":[0,351],"elapsed":6.101801041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
