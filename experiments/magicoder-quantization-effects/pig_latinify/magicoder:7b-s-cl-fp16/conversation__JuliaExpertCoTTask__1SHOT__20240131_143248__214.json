It uses the `@everywhere` macro to define the `pig_latin!` and `pig_latinify` functions in all workers, so they can be run on separate threads.\n\nThe `pig_latin!` function is responsible for translating one word into pig latin, and it uses the `mapreduce` function to apply this transformation to each word in a list of words.\n\nFinally, the `main` function creates a vector of strings, applies the `pig_latinify` function to each string using `Distributed.@spawn`, then prints the results. The `@spawn` macro is used to run these tasks on separate threads.","status":200,"tokens":[0,421],"elapsed":7.32613727,"_type":"aimessage"}]
