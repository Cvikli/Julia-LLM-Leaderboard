[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is an example solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    function translate(word)\n        vowels = [\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"]\n        if word[1] in vowels\n            return \"$(word)way\"\n        elseif occursin(\"qu\", word)\n            return \"$(replace(word, \"qu\" => \"\"))ay\"\n        else \n            return \"$(split(word)[2])ay $(split(word)[1]\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    Threads.@threads for word in words\n        println(translate(lowercase(word)))\n    end\nend\n```\nThe `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as input and applies the translation to each string using multiple threads. The translation is done by a helper function called `translate`. For English words that start with a vowel, \"way\" is appended to the end of the word. For words that start with \"qu\", those two letters are removed and then \"ay\" is added to the end. For all other words, the first character is moved at the end and \"ay\" is added.\nPlease replace `{{instructions}}` with your specific instructions or remove it if not necessary. \nRemember: Julia uses 1-based indexing, which means that the first element of an array is accessed using index 1, not 0 like in some other programming languages.","status":200,"tokens":[0,338],"elapsed":5.974957584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
