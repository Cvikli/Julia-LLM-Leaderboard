It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Python code for the problem:\n```python\nimport concurrent.futures\n\ndef pig_latinify(words):\n    result = []\n    \n    def convert_word_to_pig_latin(word):\n        if word[0] in 'aeiou':\n            return f'{word}way'\n        else:\n            return f'{word[1:]}{word[0]}ay'\n            \n    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:\n        futures = {executor.submit(convert_word_to_pig_latin, word) for word in words}\n        \n        for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures):\n            result.append(future.result())\n            \n    return result\n```\nIn this code, `pig_latinify` function takes a list of strings as input and returns the transformed list. Inside this function, there is another nested function `convert_word_to_pig_latin` that converts each word into pig latin format. \n\nWe use concurrent.futures library to run these tasks in parallel using multiple threads. This makes our program faster as it can process the words simultaneously instead of one by one. The result is a list of strings where each string represents the pig latin version of its original word.","status":200,"tokens":[0,308],"elapsed":5.333930982,"_type":"aimessage"}]
