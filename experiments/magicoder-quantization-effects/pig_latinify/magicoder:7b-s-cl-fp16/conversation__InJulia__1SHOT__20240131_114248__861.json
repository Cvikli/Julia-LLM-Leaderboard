Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)\n    @sync begin\n        for string in strings\n            @async begin\n                println(\"$(string[1])ay $(join(string[2:end]))ay\")\n            end\n        end\n    end\nend\n\npig_latinify([\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"])\n```\n\nIn this code, we use the `@sync` macro to ensure that all asynchronous tasks started by the `for` loop finish before the function returns. The `@async` macro is used to start a new task for each string in the input array. Each task changes the current string into pig latin and prints it out.\n\nPlease note, this code will print the result on console but not return anything as it's an example of how you can apply multithreading in Julia. If you want to use the transformed strings later, you should consider using a more sophisticated data structure or a mutable variable.","status":200,"tokens":[0,234],"elapsed":4.040516752,"_type":"aimessage"}]
