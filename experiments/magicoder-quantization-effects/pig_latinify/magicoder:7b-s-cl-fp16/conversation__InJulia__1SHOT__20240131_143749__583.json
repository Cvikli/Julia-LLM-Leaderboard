Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the code in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    results = fill(\"\", length(words))\n    @threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        word = words[i]\n        first_letter = word[1]\n        if islowercase(first_letter)\n            results[i] = word * \"ay\"\n        elseif isuppercase(first_letter)\n            results[i] = uppercase(word[2:end]) * first_letter * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n    return results\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, we use the `@threads` macro from Julia's Threads package to parallelize our loop across multiple threads. The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as input and returns a vector with each string transformed into pig latin. \n\nThe transformation is done inside the for loop, where we check if the first letter of the word is uppercase or lowercase. If it's lowercase, we just append \"ay\" to the end of the word. If it's uppercase, we move all the letters after the first one to the beginning and add a capitalized version of the first letter at the end followed by \"ay\". \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that words are separated by spaces and each word is only made up of alphabetic characters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,318],"elapsed":5.493820398,"_type":"aimessage"}]
