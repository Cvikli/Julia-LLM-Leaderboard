The `@sync` macro ensures that all asynchronous tasks started inside it are executed before continuing. \n\nThe `@async` macro starts a new task for each string in the vector. Each task prints the transformed version of the string. Replace the `println(str)` line with your actual transformation logic.\n\nNote: This code assumes you're using Julia's Distributed package, which allows you to run tasks on separate threads. If you don't have this package installed or are not running in a multi-threaded environment, you may need to adjust the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,233],"elapsed":4.02212551,"_type":"aimessage"}]
