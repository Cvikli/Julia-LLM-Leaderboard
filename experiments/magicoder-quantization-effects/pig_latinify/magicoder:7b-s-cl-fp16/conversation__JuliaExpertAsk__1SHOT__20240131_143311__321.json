The `@async` macro creates a new task for each word in the sentence, which is then run on a separate thread.\n\nPlease note that this code will print out the translated words one by one as they complete, due to the nature of the `@async` macro and `@sync` block. If you want to collect all of them into an array or other data structure, you can modify the `pig_latinify(sentence::Vector{String})` function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[99,394],"elapsed":6.841115331,"_type":"aimessage"}]
