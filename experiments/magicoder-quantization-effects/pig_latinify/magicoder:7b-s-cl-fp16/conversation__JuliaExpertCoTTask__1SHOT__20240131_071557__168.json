It uses the `concurrent.futures` module to create separate threads for each word in the input list. The `pig_latin` function is used as a helper function to transform individual words into pig latin.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function checks if the length of the word is greater than 1, and if it is, it moves the first letter(s) to the end of the word and appends \"ay\". If the word has only one character, it returns the original word as pig latin.\n\nFor example:\n```python\nprint(pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]))  # Outputs ['ellohay', 'appleyay', 'rongstray', 'orldway']\n```","status":200,"tokens":[230,397],"elapsed":32.793361325,"_type":"aimessage"}]
