Except for words that start with a vowel. Then just add \n    # 'ay' to the end.\n    \n    if len(word) > 0:\n        if word[0] in \"aeiou\":\n            return word + \"ay\"\n        else:\n            return word[1:] + word[0] + \"ay\"\n    else:\n        return word\n```\nIn the `pig_latinify` function, it creates a ThreadPoolExecutor to handle multithreading. It submits each word in the list to be transformed into pig latin to the executor. Then it waits for all threads to complete and collects their results. Each thread runs the `piglatin_word` function which checks if the first letter of the word is a vowel, then returns the transformed word; otherwise, it moves the first consonant/vowel to the end and appends \"ay\". \n\nThis implementation will work on a list of strings. Each transformation into pig latin is run in its own thread. If any transformation throws an exception, it gets caught by the executor's exception handling mechanism.","status":200,"tokens":[142,455],"elapsed":12.505333482,"_type":"aimessage"}]
