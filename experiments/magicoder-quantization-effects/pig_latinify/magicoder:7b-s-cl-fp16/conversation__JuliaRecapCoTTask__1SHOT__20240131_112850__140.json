[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution using Julia's multithreading capabilities:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n@everywhere begin\n    function pig_latinify(str::AbstractString)\n        words = split(lowercase(str), ' ')\n        pig_words = [word[2:end]*word[1]*\"ay\" for word in words]\n        join(pig_words, \" \")\n    end\nend\n\nfunction main()\n    strs = [\"Hello\", \"world!\"]\n    addprocs(2) # create 2 worker processes\n    @sync begin\n        @distributed for str in strs\n            println(pig_latinify(str))\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nmain()\nrmprocs(workers()) # remove the created workers\n```\n\nIn this code, `@everywhere` is used to define a function that will be available on all worker processes. The `for` loop inside `@sync @distributed` creates a task for each string in strs and runs it on a separate process. The result of each task (i.e., the pig latin version of the input string) is printed out. After finishing, we remove the created workers with `rmprocs(workers())`.\n\nThe special instructions can be added inside the main function as per requirements. For example, you could add a condition to check if the input string contains any vowels or consonants and apply different transformations accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,326],"elapsed":5.711872282,"_type":"aimessage"}]
