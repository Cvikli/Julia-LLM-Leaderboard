[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `@spawnat` macro is used to spawn a task on a specific thread. The `waitall()` function is then used to wait for all tasks to complete before returning the results.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_threaded` function does the actual pig latinification of a string by splitting it into words, transforming each word according to the rules of pig Latin (moving the first letter to the end and appending \"ay\"), and then joining the transformed words back together.\n\nRemember that you need to have Julia's parallel computing package `Distributed` installed for this code to work. If it is not already installed, you can add it using Pkg:\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"Distributed\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,457],"elapsed":8.026951759,"_type":"aimessage"}]
