It first checks if there's a cluster running and starts one if not. Then it distributes the work across all available workers using `@spawnat`. \n\nThe worker functions (`pig_latinify!`) are defined to transform each string into pig latin. They split the string into words, reverse them, transform each word to pig latin, and then rejoin them back together.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that you have a Julia installation with multiple workers available (i.e., it's not running in a Jupyter notebook or similar). If you want to run this on a single machine, you can simply remove the distributed processing parts of the code and it will work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[0,470],"elapsed":8.157168497,"_type":"aimessage"}]
