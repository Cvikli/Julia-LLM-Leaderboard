[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    @sync begin\n        for word in words\n            @async println(pig_latin(word))\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word::AbstractString)\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    rest_of_word = word[2:end]\n    return \"$(rest_of_word)$first_letteray\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function `pig_latinify` takes a vector of strings as input and for each string, it spawns a new thread to convert the string into pig latin. The `@sync begin ... end` construct is used to ensure that all threads are joined before the function returns. \n\nThe `pig_latin` function takes a single word as input and returns the word translated into pig latin. It does this by taking the first letter of the word, appending it at the end of the rest of the word (which is everything except for the first character), and adding \"ay\" to the end. \n\nYou can call `pig_latinify` with a vector of strings like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\npig_latinify(words)\n```\nThis will print out each word translated into pig latin on a separate line.","status":200,"tokens":[0,329],"elapsed":5.864370038,"_type":"aimessage"}]
