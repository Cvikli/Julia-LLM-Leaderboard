It uses `@threads` for multithreading, which divides work among available threads.\n\nThe `pig_latin_transform` function splits the input string into words, transforms each word using `pig_latin_word`, and then joins them back together with spaces. The `pig_latin_word` function capitalizes the first letter of a word if it's lowercase (so \"apple\" becomes \"Appleay\") and adds \"ay\" to the end.\n\nNote that this code assumes that words in the input string are separated by spaces, and that punctuation is not part of a word. If you want to handle these cases differently, you would need to modify `pig_latin_word` accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,488],"elapsed":8.483260652,"_type":"aimessage"}]
