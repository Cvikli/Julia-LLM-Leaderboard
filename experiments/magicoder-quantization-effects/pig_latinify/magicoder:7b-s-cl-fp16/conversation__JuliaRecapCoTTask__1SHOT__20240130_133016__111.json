[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function iterates over each string in the input vector using `@threads`, allowing it to be run on multiple threads. Each string is transformed into Pig Latin via the `pig_latin` function and printed out.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function checks if the first letter of a word is a vowel (using lowercase so it works regardless of case) or 'qu'. If so, it adds 'ay' to the end and returns the result. If not, it moves the first two letters to the end and adds 'ay'.\n\nPlease note that this code will work best if you have at least Julia 1.6 installed in your system as `@threads` feature is a part of Julia 1.6.\n\nYou can call `pig_latinify([\"apple\", \"grape\", \"banana\"])` to test the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,672],"elapsed":11.916877011,"_type":"aimessage"}]
