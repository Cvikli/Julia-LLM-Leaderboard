[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

This function uses `@sync for` loop to iterate over each string in the vector concurrently with `@async`. \n\nThe `@sync` macro ensures all asynchronous tasks are executed before proceeding to the next line of code. The `@async` macro creates a new task that is scheduled to run whenever Julia has time to do so.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function takes each word and changes it to pig latin format. If the word length is more than one character, the first letter is moved to the end of the word and \"ay\" is appended at the beginning. If the word length is 1 or less, it remains as it is.\n\nYou can call `pig_latinify` function with an array of words like this:\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\npig_latinify(words)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,355],"elapsed":6.230910868,"_type":"aimessage"}]
