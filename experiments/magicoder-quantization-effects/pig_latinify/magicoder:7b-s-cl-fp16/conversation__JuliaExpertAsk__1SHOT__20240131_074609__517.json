It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n@everywhere using Transducers\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    @sync begin\n        for string in strings\n            @async println(pig_latin(string))\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(s::AbstractString)\n    words = split(s, ' ')\n    transduce(map(pig_latin_word), append_list, [], words)\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_word(w::AbstractString)\n    if islowercase(w[1])\n        return \"$(w[2:end])$(w[1])ay\"\n    else\n        return \"$(w[2:end])$(uppercase(w[1]))ay\"\n    end\nend\n```\nThis code defines a `pig_latinify` function that takes an array of strings as input. It uses `@sync begin ... end` to ensure all threads are joined before the function returns. Each string is processed in its own thread with `@async`.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function splits the input string into words, and applies the `pig_latin_word` function to each word using the `transduce` function from the Transducers package. The result is a vector of pig latin words.\n\nThe `pig_latin_word` function takes a word as input and returns its pig latin version. If the first letter of the word is lowercase, it appends \"ay\" to the end of the rest of the word; if the first letter is uppercase, it also converts this letter to lowercase before appending \"ay\".\n\nPlease note that you need to install Transducers package by `using Pkg; Pkg.add(\"Transducers\")` in your Julia environment.","status":200,"tokens":[99,431],"elapsed":7.548794004,"_type":"aimessage"}]
