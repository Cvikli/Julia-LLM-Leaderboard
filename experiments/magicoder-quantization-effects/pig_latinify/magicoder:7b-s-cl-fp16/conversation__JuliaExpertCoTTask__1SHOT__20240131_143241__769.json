It uses `@sync begin ... @async ...` to run each word transformation in its own thread. The `pig_latinify_word` function is called by the `@async println(pig_latinify_word(word))` line inside the for loop, which iterates over every word in the input list.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_word` function checks if the first letter of a word is uppercase or lowercase and handles it accordingly to transform the word into pig latin. If the word length is greater than 1, it moves all characters after the first one to the end and adds 'ay'. If the word only has one character (and it's uppercase), it changes that character to lowercase and appends 'a' + 'y'. Otherwise, it just appends 'ay' to the original word.\n\nWhen you call `pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])`, it will print:\n```julia\n\"ellohay\"\n\"appleyay\"\n\"strongyay\"\n\"orldway\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,437],"elapsed":7.60883561,"_type":"aimessage"}]
