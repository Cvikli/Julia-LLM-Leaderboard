[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is the code for your task:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    @sync begin\n        for word in words\n            @async println(pig_latin(word))\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word)\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    if islowercase(first_letter)\n        return \"$(word[2:end])ay\"\n    elseif isuppercase(first_letter)\n        return \"$(word[2:end])AY\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `pig_latinify` that takes in a vector of strings. It uses `@sync begin ... @async ... end` to create a new thread for each word in the input vector. The `pig_latin` function is then called on each word, and its output (the pig latin version of the word) is printed out.\n\nThe `islowercase(first_letter)` and `isuppercase(first_letter)` checks if the first letter of the word is uppercase or lowercase respectively. If it's lowercase, it appends \"ay\" to the rest of the word; if it's uppercase, it appends \"AY\" instead.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"orange\", \"banana\"]\npig_latinify(words)\n```\nThis will print out the pig latin version of each word on a new line.","status":200,"tokens":[0,361],"elapsed":6.31233297,"_type":"aimessage"}]
