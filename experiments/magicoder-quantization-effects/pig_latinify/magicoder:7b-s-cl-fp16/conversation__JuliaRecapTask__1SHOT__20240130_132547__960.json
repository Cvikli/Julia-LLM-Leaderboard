[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is the code for the `pig_latinify` function that takes a vector of strings as an argument. The function iterates over each string in parallel using multithreading. The pig latin transformation works by adding \"ay\" to the end of every word in the string except for the first one, moving it to the beginning and adding \"ay\".\n\nThe following is written in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    # Create a channel that will store our transformed words.\n    out_channel = Channel(length(words))\n    \n    # Define a function to transform a single word into pig latin.\n    function do_word(ch, word)\n        new_word = \"\"\n        for i in 2:length(word)\n            new_word *= string(word[i]) * \"ay\"\n        end\n        \n        push!(new_word, word[1], new_word)\n    end\n    \n    # Transform each word into pig latin on a separate thread.\n    for word in words\n        @async put!(out_channel, do_word(ch, word))\n    end\n    \n    # Collect the transformed words from the channel and return them as an array.\n    pig_latin = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    for i in 1:length(words)\n        pig_latin[i] = take!(out_channel)\n    end\n    \n    close(out_channel)\n    return pig_latin\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `@async` macro to create a new task for each word in parallel. The `do_word` function is applied to each word on its own thread, and the transformed words are put into an output channel. After all threads have finished, the function collects the transformed words from the channel and returns them as an array.","status":200,"tokens":[0,429],"elapsed":7.617116028,"_type":"aimessage"}]
