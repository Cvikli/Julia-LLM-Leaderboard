It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you could solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads, Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strs)\n    # Create an empty vector to store the results\n    results = Vector{String}()\n\n    # Define a function that transforms one string into Pig Latin\n    function translate(i, s)\n        words = split(s)\n        pig_latin_words = map(lowercase, words) do word\n            if isempty(word)\n                return \"\"\n            elseif first(word) ∈ 'a':'z'\n                return join(vcat(\"ay\", word), \"\")\n            elseif word[1] == uppercase('A') || word[1] == uppercase('E') ||\n                     word[1] == uppercase('I') || word[1] == upperbase('O') || \n                     word[1] == uppercase('U')\n                return join(vcat(\"ay\", word), \"\")\n            elseif first(word) ∈ 'A':'Z'\n                return join(vcat(uppercase(word[end]), reverse(word[2:end-1])), \"\")\n            end\n        end\n        \n        # Return the Pig Latin version of the string\n        join(pig_latin_words, \" \")\n    end\n\n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(strs)\n        push!(results, translate(i, strs[i]))\n    end\n    \n    # Return the vector of Pig Latin strings\n    results\nend\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `pig_latinify` that takes a vector of strings as input. It uses the `Threads.@threads` macro to apply the translation function to each string in parallel, and stores the results in an array. \n\nThe translation function `translate` is defined inside the main function, so it can access variables from its enclosing scope, like `results`, which is a vector where the Pig Latin versions of the strings are stored.\n\nIn this code, the Pig Latin transformation is applied to each string in the input array separately, and the results are stored in an output array. The `@threads` macro automatically divides the work into threads if Julia was compiled with multithreading support.","status":200,"tokens":[0,520],"elapsed":9.217322162,"_type":"aimessage"}]
