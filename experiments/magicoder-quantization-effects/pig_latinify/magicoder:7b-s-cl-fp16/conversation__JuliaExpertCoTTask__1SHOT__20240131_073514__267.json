It uses `@sync begin ... end` to ensure that all the threads are synchronized and run sequentially. \n\nEach word is processed by a separate thread using `@async`. The word is transformed into pig latin via the `pig_latin_word` function, which adds \"ay\" to the end of the word except for the first letter, which is placed at the beginning of the new word.\n\nYou can test this code with: \n```julia\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\n```\nThis will print out each translated pig latin word on a separate line.","status":200,"tokens":[230,294],"elapsed":75.871079338,"_type":"aimessage"}]
