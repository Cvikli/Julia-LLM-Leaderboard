[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

This allows us to take advantage of multi-threading capabilities in Julia. \n\nThen, the `pig_latinify` function uses `@sync begin ... end` to ensure that all asynchronous tasks (`@async begin ... end`) are executed before the function returns.\n\nEach task within the loop is an anonymous function that calls `pig_latin_word(word)`. This function takes a word and checks if its first letter is a vowel. If it is, we append \"way\" to the end of the word; otherwise, we move all letters after the first one to the end of the word and add \"ay\".\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that you have Julia installed on your machine and that you're running it in a REPL or Jupyter notebook.","status":200,"tokens":[0,412],"elapsed":7.213006103,"_type":"aimessage"}]
