The pig_latin function translates a single word into Pig Latin. If the first letter of the word is a vowel, it adds \"way\" to the end. Otherwise, it moves the first letter to the end and appends \"ay\".\n\nWhen you run this code with the input [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"], it will print: ['ellohay', 'appleyay', 'rongstray', 'orldway'].","status":200,"tokens":[0,337],"elapsed":5.864225586,"_type":"aimessage"}]
