It then defines a function `pig_latinify` that operates on each word in a vector of strings, converting it into pig latin. The `@everywhere` macro is used to define this function on all workers (threads), and `pmap` is used to apply this function concurrently across the input list.\n\nThe result is then printed out by calling the `pig_latinify` function with a vector of words as its argument.","status":200,"tokens":[0,254],"elapsed":4.385803071,"_type":"aimessage"}]
