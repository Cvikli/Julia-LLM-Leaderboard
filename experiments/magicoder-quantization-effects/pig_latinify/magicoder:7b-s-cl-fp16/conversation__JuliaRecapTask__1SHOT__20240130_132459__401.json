[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Below is an example of how one could implement the `pig_latinify` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads # for multithreading\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(strings))  # preallocate vector to store results\n\n    @threads for i in eachindex(strings)  # iterate over strings with threading\n        string = strings[i]\n        words = split(string, \" \")   # split string into individual words\n        new_words = String[]       # array to hold the pig latin version of the words\n        \n        for word in words\n            first_letter = word[1]  # get the first letter of the word\n            rest_of_word = word[2:end]  # get the rest of the word\n            \n            # change 'ay' to 'aY' because we want to keep original capitalization intact.\n            new_word = isuppercase(first_letter) ? string * \"ay\" : lowercase(string) * \"ay\"\n            push!(new_words, new_word)  # add the pig latin word to the array\n        end\n        \n        result[i] = join(new_words, \" \")   # convert the words back into a string and store it in result vector\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\nPlease note that this function does not handle punctuation (like commas, colons) correctly. It also assumes that words are separated by spaces, which is standard for English text. If you're working with a different kind of text or need to handle other special cases, you would want to modify the code accordingly. \n\nAlso, if we want to use `pig_latinify` function on an array `arr`, simply call it as follows:\n```julia\nprintln.(pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"world\", \"Julia\"]))\n```","status":200,"tokens":[369,479],"elapsed":8.637947797,"_type":"aimessage"}]
