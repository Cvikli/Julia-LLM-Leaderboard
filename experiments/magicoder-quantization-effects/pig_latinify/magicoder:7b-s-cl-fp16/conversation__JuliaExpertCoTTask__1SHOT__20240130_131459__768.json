For each word in the list passed into `pig_latinify`, it spawns a new thread that runs our pig_latin function on that word and appends the result onto a list. The final list is then returned by pig_latinify. \n\nThe pig_latin function takes in a word, and returns its translation to Pig Latin. It does this by moving the first letter of each word to the end of the word followed by 'ay'. If a word has only one character (or no characters), it just adds 'ay' to that character(s). \n\nThis script then prints out [\"elloHay\", \"applepay\", \"strongray\", \"orldway\"], which are the Pig Latin versions of your input words.","status":200,"tokens":[230,396],"elapsed":11.375188221,"_type":"aimessage"}]
