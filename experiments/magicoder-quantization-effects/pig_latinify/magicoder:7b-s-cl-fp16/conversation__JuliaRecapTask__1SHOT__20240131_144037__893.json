[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia code for solving this problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::AbstractVector{String})\n    @sync begin\n        for word in words\n            @async println(pig_latinify(word))\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(word::String)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    first_letter = word[1] in vowels ? \"\" : word[1]\n    rest = word[(first_letter == \"\") ? 2 : 1 : end]\n    return \"$(rest)$(first_letteray)\"\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, we define two functions: `pig_latinify` and an inner function `pig_latinify`. The outer function receives a vector of strings as input. It uses `@sync begin ... end` to create a new thread for each word in the input vector. The inner function `pig_latinify` checks if the first letter of the string is a vowel or not, and then it appends this character at the end of the string.\n\nThe `@async println(pig_latinify(word))` inside the loop means that each transformation will be done in a separate thread. The `println` function is used here just to print the result on the console. \n\nNote: This code assumes that words are separated by spaces and punctuation is not considered part of the word. If you need to handle these cases, you would need to modify this solution accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,354],"elapsed":6.203480347,"_type":"aimessage"}]
