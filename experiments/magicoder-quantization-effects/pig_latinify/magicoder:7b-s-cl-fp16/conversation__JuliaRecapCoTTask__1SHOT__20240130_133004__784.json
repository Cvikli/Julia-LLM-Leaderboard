[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To create this function, we will need to use the built-in Julia standard library functions for strings manipulation, like `split`, `join` and `lowercase`. We will also leverage multithreading capabilities of Julia with the `@threads` macro. \n\nHere's a sample solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)\n    @threads for string in strings\n        words = split(string, \" \")\n        new_words = map(lowercase, words) do word\n            if first(word) âˆˆ vowels\n                \"$(word)ay\"\n            else\n                \"$(word[2:end])ay $(word[1])$(isspace(word[2]) ? \"\" : \" \")ay\"\n            end\n        end\n        println(\"$(join(new_words, \" \"))ay\")\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this code, `pig_latinify` is the function we're creating that accepts a vector of strings and iterates over each string in parallel threads using `@threads`. For each word, it checks if the first letter is a vowel. If yes, it appends \"ay\" to the end of the word. If not, it takes everything after the first character and puts it at the beginning of the word followed by \"ay\". \n\nIf there's a space before the first character in a word, it preserves that space when appending the word back together, otherwise it doesn't add any extra spaces. At the end of each thread, it prints out the new string in pig latin form. Note that we use `map` with a function to modify every word in the list.\n\nRemember to define the `vowels` constant as follows:\n```julia\nconst vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n```\n\nThis code should be used cautiously because it prints out pig latin strings in a new line for every input string. If you want to collect all the translated words into a single vector, use `Vector{String}` instead of printing each one and modify the function accordingly.\n\n{{instructions}}","status":200,"tokens":[0,478],"elapsed":8.445535953,"_type":"aimessage"}]
