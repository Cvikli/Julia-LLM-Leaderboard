It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could do this in Julia using the Threads package:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)\n    @threads for string in strings\n        println(pig_latin_transform(string))\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_transform(word)\n    # Assuming that words start with a consonant and vowels are at the beginning of the word.\n    if startswith(lowercase(word), ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'])\n        return \"$worday\"\n    else\n        return \"$(split(word)[2])ay $(split(word)[1]\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, `pig_latinify` is a function that takes in an array of strings. It uses the `@threads` macro to create a new thread for each string in the input array. The `pig_latin_transform` function is used within these threads to transform each word into pig latin.\n\nPlease note, this code assumes that words start with a vowel and consonants are at the beginning of the word. If your language rules differ, you'll need to adjust the `pig_latin_transform` function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,290],"elapsed":5.023961429,"_type":"aimessage"}]
