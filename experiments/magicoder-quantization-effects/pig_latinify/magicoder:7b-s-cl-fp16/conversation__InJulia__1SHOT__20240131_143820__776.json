We use `@threads` to create threads for each string. For each word, we concatenate the first character with \"_\" and rest of the characters in lowercase followed by \"ay\".\n\nPlease note: The above code is not perfect as it doesn't handle punctuation marks properly. It also doesn't take care of capitalization of the first letter after translation to pig latin. Also, it treats all words equally and does not consider the English language grammar rules for word formation. These are simplifications for brevity sake. \n\nAlso note that you need to install the Threads package by running `Pkg.add(\"Threads\")` in your Julia console before using this function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,291],"elapsed":5.027183218,"_type":"aimessage"}]
