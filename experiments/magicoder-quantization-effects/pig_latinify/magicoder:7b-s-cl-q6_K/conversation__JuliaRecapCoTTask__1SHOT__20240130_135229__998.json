X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In the Pig Latin language, words are translated according to their initial consonant sounds. If a word begins with a vowel or a consonant followed by a quiet letter (like 'q', 'x' etc.) then we just add \"ay\" at the end of that word to form the Pig Latin equivalent. If not, we have to move these initial consonants to the end of the word and then add \"ay\". Also remember that \"qu\" is pronounced like a single sound so when translated into Pig Latin it should be treated as one sound.\n\nHere's how you can write `pig_latinify` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String}; instructions::String=\"\")\n    @sync begin\n        for string in strings\n            @spawnat :any Threads.threadid() begin\n                # replace vowels with \"ay\" and consonant groups ending with a quiet letter with \"ay\" appended\n                # this is the pig latin translation\n                pig_latin = replace(string, r\"[aeiou]*qu|[bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz]*qu?\" => s\"$0ay\")\n                \n                println(\"Pig Latin translation of '$string' is: $pig_latin\")\n            end\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\nYou can use this function by calling it with a vector of strings. For example, `pig_latinify([\"apple\", \"banana\"])`. The special instructions argument isn't used in the current implementation but you can add your own instructions here if needed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,374],"elapsed":3.707340031,"_type":"aimessage"}]
