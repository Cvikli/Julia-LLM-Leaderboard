Inside the loop, we concatenate \"way\" to the beginning of each word and print the result. Please note that this code does not actually modify the input vector `words`. If you want to modify it in-place, you would need to use a mutable data type like an array or a vector.\n\nCalling `pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])` will print out each word followed by \"way\" on separate lines, but the function does not return anything because it does not modify the input vector. If you want to get the result as a string array (vector of strings), use `map`:\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    Threads.@threads map(word -> \"$worday\", words)\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[230,246],"elapsed":4.373258422,"_type":"aimessage"}]
