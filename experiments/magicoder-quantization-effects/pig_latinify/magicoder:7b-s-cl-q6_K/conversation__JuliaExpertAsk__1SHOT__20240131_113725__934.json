This is necessary because Julia's threads aren't truly parallel - they can't run on different CPU cores at once.\n\nEach iteration of the loop runs in a separate thread, thanks to `@async`. The `println` function inside the `@async` block is just for demonstration purposes and should be replaced with your actual pig latin transformation logic.","status":200,"tokens":[0,190],"elapsed":1.809838512,"_type":"aimessage"}]
