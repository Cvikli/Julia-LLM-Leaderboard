It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    @threads for word in words\n        println(pig_latin_transform(word))\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_transform(word)\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    rest_of_word = word[2:end]\n    return \"$rest_of_word$first_letteray\"\nend\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `pig_latinify` that takes in an array of strings. It uses the `@threads` macro from Julia's Base.Threads module to create threads for each word in the input array. The `pig_latin_transform` function is then called on each thread, which transforms a single word into pig latin.\n\nPlease note that this code only prints out the transformed words and does not return them or store them anywhere. If you want to collect all the transformed words in an array, you can use `push!` inside the loop:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    result = []\n    @threads for word in words\n        push!(result, pig_latin_transform(word))\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,299],"elapsed":2.849401344,"_type":"aimessage"}]
