This is how you transform the word into Pig Latin.\n3) Each transformation should run on a separate thread.\n\nHere's an example of how this can be done in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    threads = Vector{Threads.Task}(undef, length(words))\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    \n    for (i, word) in enumerate(words)\n        threads[i] = @async begin\n            vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n            str = \"\"\n            flag = true\n            for char in word\n                if islower(char) && !(char in vowels) || (isupper(char) && (flag == false))\n                    str *= char\n                else\n                    flag = false\n                end\n            end\n            results[i] = string(word[2:end], word[1], str)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    Threads.wait(threads) # Wait for all threads to finish\n    return results\nend\n```\nIn the function above, we use `@async` macro from `Threads` module to create tasks in parallel. Each task is responsible for transforming one word into Pig Latin and storing the result in a vector of strings (`results`). We store tasks not results directly because tasks are lightweight objects that can be easily shared across threads using a Vector, and we want to avoid extra memory usage by creating intermediate results.\n\nPlease note that in this function we assume words only contain lowercase letters and words are separated by spaces or punctuation marks (as Pig Latin does not change the case of letters). This is a simplification for demonstration purposes, but real world usage may need to handle other cases as well.","status":200,"tokens":[0,490],"elapsed":4.778337825,"_type":"aimessage"}]
