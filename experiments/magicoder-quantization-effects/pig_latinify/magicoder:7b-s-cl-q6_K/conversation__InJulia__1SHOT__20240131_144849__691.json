For example:\n\n```julia\nstrings = [\"apple\", \"orange\", \"banana\"]\npig_latinify(strings)\n```\nThis will print out each word translated into Pig Latin in different threads, which should make the process faster as it takes advantage of multi-threading.","status":200,"tokens":[0,398],"elapsed":3.835047525,"_type":"aimessage"}]
