[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    function translate_word(word)\n        first_letter = word[1]\n        rest_of_word = word[2:end]\n        \n        return \"$rest_of_word$first_letteray\"\n    end\n    \n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        words[i] = translate_word(words[i])\n    end\n    \n    return words\nend\n```\nThis function works by defining a helper function `translate_word` that takes a word and returns it translated into pig latin. This is done by taking the first letter of the word, appending it to the rest of the word, and then adding \"ay\" at the end. \n\nThe main function `pig_latinify` uses `@threads` from Julia's Threads module to iterate over each string in the input vector in a separate thread. It modifies the strings in-place by directly assigning to their indices in the array. \n\nPlease note that this is a simple example and might not cover all edge cases or requirements of your task. For example, it assumes words are separated by spaces and does not handle punctuation.","status":200,"tokens":[0,290],"elapsed":2.961400214,"_type":"aimessage"}]
