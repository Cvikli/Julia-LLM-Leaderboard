[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin.

The `pig_latin_word` function is used to translate a single word into Pig Latin, where it takes the first character, moves it to the end of the word (with \"ay\" appended), and returns the resulting string.\n\nWhen you run this script, each word from the vector is processed in its own thread. The results are then printed out at once.","status":200,"tokens":[0,248],"elapsed":2.345960241,"_type":"aimessage"}]
