[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `@sync begin ... end` block makes sure that all the `@async` tasks inside it are executed concurrently, one after another.\n\nInside the loop, for each word in words, the function uses an `@async` task to print out the Pig Latin version of that word. If the first letter is uppercase (indicating a capitalized word), \"ay\" is appended; otherwise, it's appended after lowercasing the first character. The `@async` and `@sync` syntax are used for multithreading in Julia.\n\nYou can run this function with a vector of words like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"banana\"]\npig_latinify(words)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,269],"elapsed":2.654736631,"_type":"aimessage"}]
