Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    @sync begin\n        for str in strings\n            @async println(pig_latin(str))\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(str::String)\n    words = split(str, ' ')\n    pig_latin_words = [word[2:end]*word[1]*\"ay\" for word in words]\n    return join(pig_latin_words, \" \")\nend\n```\n\nIn this code we use the `@sync` macro to ensure that all the threads started by `@async begin ... end` block are properly synchronized. We then iterate over each string and transform it into pig latin using a separate thread for each string with the `@async` macro.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function splits the input string into words, applies the pig latin transformation to each word, and then joins them back together into a single string.\n\nPlease note that this version of Pig Latin moves only first letter to the end and adds \"ay\". If you want more complex rules (like treating 'qu' as one consonant), you would need to adjust the `pig_latin` function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,301],"elapsed":2.887131086,"_type":"aimessage"}]
