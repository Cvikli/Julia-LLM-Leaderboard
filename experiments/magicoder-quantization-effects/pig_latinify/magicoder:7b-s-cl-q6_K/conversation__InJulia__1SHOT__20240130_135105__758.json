The former function checks whether the length of the input array is greater than 20 (as it would not be efficient to split an array with less than that number of elements into separate processes) and if so, it spawns a new process for each chunk of words. It then calls `pig_latinify_word` on these chunks in parallel using the `@spawnat` macro. The results are collected together at the end using `Distributed.waitall()`. If this is not the case (i.e., we have fewer than 20 words or only one word), it simply calls `pig_latinify_word` on each string in sequence, returning a list of transformed strings.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_word` function takes a string as input and transforms it into pig latin by appending the first letter to the end with \"ay\" added in between. If the input is an empty string or a capitalized single-letter word, it just returns the original string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,495],"elapsed":4.820380622,"_type":"aimessage"}]
