Otherwise, move all consonants to the end and add \"ay\".\n            if occursin('a', lowercase(first_letter)) || \n               occursin('e', lowercase(first_letter)) || \n               occursin('i', lowercase(first_letter)) || \n               occursin('o', lowercase(first_letter)) || \n               occursin('u', lowercase(first_letter))\n                results[i] = word * \"ay\"\n            else\n                words = split(word, \"\") # Convert the string to an array of characters\n                move_consonants = reverse([w for w in filter!(x -> !occursin('a', lowercase(x)), \n                                                              [w for w in words[2:end]])]) # Move all consonants at the end\n                results[i] = string(move_consonants..., \"ay\", first_letter)\n            end\n        elseif length(word) == 1 && occursin('a', lowercase(word))\n            results[i] = word * \"ay\"\n        else # If the word is only one letter, it stays the same\n            results[i] = word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Apply the function on each item with threads\n    @threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        process_word(i)\n    end\n    return results\nend\n```\nThis function uses a separate thread to convert each string to pig latin. It checks if the first letter of the word is a vowel or consonant and applies different transformations based on these conditions.\nPlease note that, due to Julia's garbage collection, it's important to avoid creating large numbers of threads, as this can lead to performance issues. Therefore, for larger inputs, a more efficient approach might be required.","status":200,"tokens":[99,573],"elapsed":5.663359608,"_type":"aimessage"}]
