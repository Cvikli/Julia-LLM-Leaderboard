[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Here is an example code snippet:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n@everywhere function pig_latinify(str::AbstractString)\n    words = split(str, ' ')\n    new_words = map(w -> pig_latin_word(w), words)\n    join(new_words, \" \")\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_word(word::AbstractString)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    if word[1] in vowels\n        return \"$(word)ay\"\n    else\n        return \"$(word[2:end])$(word[1])ay\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction main()\n    strings = [\"hello\", \"world\"]  # replace with your vector of strings\n    pids = addprocs(length(strings))\n    @sync begin\n        for (i, string) in enumerate(strings)\n            @spawn on(pids[i]) do\n                println(pig_latinify(string))\n            end\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nmain()\nrmprocs(allprocs())  # clean up after yourself\n```\n\nIn this code, we create a function `pig_latinify` that takes a string and transforms it to pig latin. We then define another helper function `pig_latin_word` which transforms an individual word into pig latin. \n\nWe use the `@everywhere` macro in order to make these functions available on all worker processes. \n\nIn the main function, we create a vector of strings and add as many processes as there are strings. We then use a for loop with the `@spawn` macro to spawn tasks that run `pig_latinify` on each string in parallel on separate processes. Finally, we print out the result and remove all worker processes. \n\nPlease note this is just an example and might not work exactly as expected if you have a very specific set of rules for pig latin transformation.","status":200,"tokens":[0,472],"elapsed":4.643342624,"_type":"aimessage"}]
