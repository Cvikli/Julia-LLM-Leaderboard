It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's how you can accomplish this in Julia using the `Distributed` package:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    @sync begin\n        for word in words\n            @async begin\n                println(pig_latin_word(word))\n            end\n        end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_word(word)\n    if length(word) > 1\n        return string(word[2:end], word[1]) * \"ay\"\n    else\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `pig_latinify` which takes an array of strings as input. Inside this function, we're using the `@async` macro to run each conversion to pig latin on a separate thread. The `@sync` macro ensures that all async tasks are completed before the main function returns.\n\nThe `pig_latin_word` function takes a single word and converts it into its pig Latin equivalent, which is then printed out by the `println` statement within an `@async` block. \n\nPlease note that this code will print each result to the console, but you can replace the `println(pig_latin_word(word))` line with any other function that processes or uses these results. You also might want to handle situations where the word is not a single character or has more than one letter (this current implementation assumes words are two characters long).","status":200,"tokens":[0,333],"elapsed":3.126210933,"_type":"aimessage"}]
