Then we define two functions `pig_latin` and `pig_latinify`. The function `pig_latinify` uses the `@everywhere` macro to ensure that these functions are available on all workers. \n\nThe `pig_latin` function splits a string into words, applies pig latin transformation to each word using parallel computing (multithreading), and then joins them back together. The final result is returned as an array of strings. \n\nPlease note that Julia's multithreaded nature might not offer substantial speed-up for small tasks such as this one due to the overhead of creating threads, but it may be beneficial when processing larger collections of data.","status":200,"tokens":[0,417],"elapsed":4.076260097,"_type":"aimessage"}]
