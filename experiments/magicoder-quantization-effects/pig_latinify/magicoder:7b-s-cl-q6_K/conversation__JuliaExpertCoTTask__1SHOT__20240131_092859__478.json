[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia code that solves this problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    @sync begin\n        for word in words\n            @async println(pig_latin(word))\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word)\n    first = word[1]\n    rest = word[2:end]\n    return \"$rest$firstay\"\nend\n```\nIn this code, we define a function `pig_latinify` that takes an array of words as input. Inside the function, we use `@sync begin ... end` to ensure all asynchronous tasks are completed before returning from the function. \n\nWe then iterate over each word in the input array and convert it into pig latin using the `pig_latin` function. Each conversion is done on a separate thread with the `@async` macro, allowing for parallel processing of the words. The result is printed out to the console.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function takes a word as input and returns its pig latin version by appending the first letter of the word at the end of the rest of the word (without the first letter).\n\nTo test this code, you can call `pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])` in your Julia REPL.","status":200,"tokens":[0,306],"elapsed":3.00571015,"_type":"aimessage"}]
