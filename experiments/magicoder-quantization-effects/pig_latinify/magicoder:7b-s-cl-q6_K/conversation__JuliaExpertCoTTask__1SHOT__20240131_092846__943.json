It uses the `@sync` macro to ensure all threads are joined before exiting. Then, it iterates over each word in the array and creates a new thread for each one using the `@async` macro. Each thread appends \"ay\" to the end of the word and prints out the result.\n\nWhen you run this code with the input `[\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]`, it will print:\n```julia\nhelloway\nappleyay\nstrongway\nworldway\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,218],"elapsed":2.140667892,"_type":"aimessage"}]
