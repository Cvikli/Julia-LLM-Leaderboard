[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of the `pig_latinify` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    @sync begin\n        for word in words\n            @async println(pig_latin(word))\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    if first_letter in vowels\n        return \"$(word)way\"\n    else\n        return \"$(word[2:end])ay $(first_letter)\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `@sync` macro to make sure that all threads are joined before exiting. The `for` loop iterates over each word in the input vector, and for each word, it creates a new thread using the `@async` macro. This allows us to process each word in parallel. \n\nThe `pig_latin` function is then called on each word within its own thread. This function checks if the first letter of the word is a vowel or not. If it's a vowel, it appends \"way\" at the end of the word. Otherwise, it moves all letters after the first one to the end and adds \"ay\" followed by the first character at the beginning.\n\nPlease note that this function does not handle punctuation and capitalization. If you need to handle these cases, you would need to add additional logic.","status":200,"tokens":[0,347],"elapsed":3.404439424,"_type":"aimessage"}]
