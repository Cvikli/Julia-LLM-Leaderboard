The `pig_latin` helper function is used for each word in the input vector. \n\nIt uses Julia's built-in `Threads` module to create threads, and it makes use of communication channels to return results from each thread back to the main thread.\n\nThis solution assumes that words are only converted to pig Latin if they start with a lowercase letter (to preserve the capitalization), and all remaining letters after the first one are appended to form the pig Latin translation.","status":200,"tokens":[0,370],"elapsed":3.625449534,"_type":"aimessage"}]
