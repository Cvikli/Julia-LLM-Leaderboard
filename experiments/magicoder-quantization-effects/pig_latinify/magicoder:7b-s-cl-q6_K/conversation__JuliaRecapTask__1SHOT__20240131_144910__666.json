[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    @sync begin\n        for word in words\n            @async println(pig_latin(word))\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word::AbstractString)\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    if islowercase(first_letter)\n        return string(word, \"ay\")\n    elseif isuppercase(first_letter)\n        return uppercase(string(first_letter * \"ay\", word[2:end]))\n    end\nend\n```\nThe `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as input and uses `@sync begin ... @async end` to ensure that all threads are synchronized. For each string in the input, it creates a new thread using `@async` which calls the `pig_latin` function on the string.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function takes a word as an argument and checks if the first letter is lowercase or uppercase. If it's lowercase, it simply appends \"ay\" at the end of the word. If it's uppercase, it converts the first letter to lowercase, then concatenates it with \"ay\" followed by the rest of the word.\n\nThis solution assumes that words are separated by spaces and capitalization is preserved in the input string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,318],"elapsed":3.111099822,"_type":"aimessage"}]
