It uses `@sync @spawnat :any` to create a new thread for each word in the input vector. The function `pig_latin_word` is used to convert an individual string into pig latin.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that every word starts with a letter and does not contain any punctuation or numbers. If your input strings can have these characters, you would need to modify the `pig_latin_word` function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,297],"elapsed":2.853780669,"_type":"aimessage"}]
