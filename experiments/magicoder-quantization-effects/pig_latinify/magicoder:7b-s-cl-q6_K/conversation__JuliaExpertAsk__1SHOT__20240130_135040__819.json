It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you could do this in Julia, using the Threads library for multithreading:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    @sync begin  # Start of the multi-threaded section\n        Threads.@threads for str in strings\n            println(pig_latin(str))\n        end\n    end  # End of the multi-threaded section\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    if word[1] in vowels\n        return string(word * \"ay\")\n    else\n        return string(word[2:end]*\"ay\", word[1])\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function `pig_latinify` takes a vector of strings and for each string, it changes it to pig latin using the helper function `pig_latin`. The `@sync` macro allows us to start multi-threaded execution in Julia. \n\nPlease note that the above code will print out the transformed words instead of returning them, because the transformations are done synchronously due to the `@sync` and `@threads` macros. If you want to get the transformed words back as a vector, you can modify the `pig_latinify` function to return a vector of strings:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    result = String[]  # Array for storing results\n    @sync begin  # Start of multi-threaded section\n        Threads.@threads for str in strings\n            push!(result, pig_latin(str))\n        end\n    end  # End of multi-threaded section\n    return result\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,407],"elapsed":3.857147294,"_type":"aimessage"}]
