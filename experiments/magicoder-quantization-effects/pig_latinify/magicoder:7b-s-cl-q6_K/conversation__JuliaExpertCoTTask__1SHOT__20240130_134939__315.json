It then uses Julia's `@threads` macro to create new threads for each word in `words`. The new thread performs the pig latin transformation and stores it in the corresponding position of `result`. Finally, it returns the transformed words.\n\nIn this implementation:\n- If the first letter of a word is a vowel (i.e., \"aeiou\"), we append \"ay\" to the end of the word; otherwise, we move all letters following the first one to the end and add \"ay\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,315],"elapsed":3.099318193,"_type":"aimessage"}]
