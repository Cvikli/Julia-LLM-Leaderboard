The `translate` helper function translates a single string into pig latin.\n\nTo use this function, you would call it with your list of strings like so:\n\n```python\nprint(pig_latinify(['hello', 'world']))\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```python\n['elloHay', 'orldway']\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,268],"elapsed":2.566573111,"_type":"aimessage"}]
