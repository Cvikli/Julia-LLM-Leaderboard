The pig latin rules are that if a word starts with a vowel, we just add \"ay\" to the end. If it starts with any other letter (and presumably consonant), we move all the rest of the letters after the first one before adding \"ay\". It does this for each word in the list on separate threads which should make it efficient even for large lists.","status":200,"tokens":[0,257],"elapsed":2.481224312,"_type":"aimessage"}]
