It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia code for your problem:\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    @sync begin\n        for word in words\n            @async begin\n                println(\"Pig latin translation of '$word' is \", translate_to_pig_latin(word))\n            end\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction translate_to_pig_latin(word)\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    rest_of_word = word[2:end]\n    return \"$rest_of_word$first_letteray\"\nend\n```\nIn this code, `pig_latinify` function is iterating over each string in a vector of strings using `@async` macro which allows running these iterations on separate threads. \n\nThe `translate_to_pig_latin` function takes a word as input and returns the pig latin translation by moving the first letter to the end and appending \"ay\".\n\nNote: This code will not work properly if you run it in console because the `@async` macro is used for asynchronous execution of tasks. If you want to test this in your script, put these functions into a file and call `pig_latinify(words)` where `words` is an array of strings that you want to translate to pig latin.\n\nAlso remember to add `addprocs()` function before calling `pig_latinify` if you want to use multiple threads. This will create new processes for each thread, and the computation will be done in parallel.","status":200,"tokens":[99,348],"elapsed":3.366972182,"_type":"aimessage"}]
