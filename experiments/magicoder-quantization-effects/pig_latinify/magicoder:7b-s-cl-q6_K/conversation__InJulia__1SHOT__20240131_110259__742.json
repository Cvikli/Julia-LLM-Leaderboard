It moves the first character to the end, adds 'AY', then moves the rest of the string to the start and adds '-'.\n- The `.|>` operator applies the `pig_latin_transducer` to each element in the input vector.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that you have a function called `uppercasefirst`, which is not provided here, but it can be implemented easily as shown above. Also, please make sure your Julia environment supports multithreading or else `@threads` macro will throw an error.","status":200,"tokens":[0,403],"elapsed":3.893251798,"_type":"aimessage"}]
