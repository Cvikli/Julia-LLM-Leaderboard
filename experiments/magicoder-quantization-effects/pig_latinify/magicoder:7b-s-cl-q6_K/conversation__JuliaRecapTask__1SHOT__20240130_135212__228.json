[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

If it is, it appends \"ay\" to the rest of the word and moves the first letter to the end. If not, it capitalizes the first letter then appends \"ay\". This is done for every word in the input array by each thread.\n- The outer function iterates over the elements of the input array with `Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(words)`. For each element, it applies the translation function and stores the result back into the original array at that position.\n- Finally, after all threads have completed their work, it joins all words together using `join` and returns the resulting string.\n\nPlease note, this example will not run in REPL as multithreading is not supported there, but it should work fine if you're working with a file or in an interactive Julia IDE like Jupyter Notebooks or VSCode.","status":200,"tokens":[0,387],"elapsed":3.839662075,"_type":"aimessage"}]
