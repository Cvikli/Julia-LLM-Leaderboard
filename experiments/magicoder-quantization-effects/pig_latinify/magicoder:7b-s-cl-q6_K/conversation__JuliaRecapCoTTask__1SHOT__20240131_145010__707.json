[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

If it does, add 'way' at the end of the word. \n    # Otherwise, move the first letter to the end and add 'ay'.\n    startswithvowel = (word[1] in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']) ? true : false\n    new_word = startswithvowel ? \"$(word)way\" : \"$(word[2:end])$(word[1])ay\"\n    \n    return new_word\nend\n```\nThis function creates a channel to communicate between the main thread and the worker threads. It then spawns a separate thread that iterates over each word in the input vector, transforming it into pig latin using the `pig_latin_word` function, and puts the results on the channel. \n\nThe main thread reads from this channel, collecting all of the transformed words together in a Vector, which it then returns.\n\nPlease note that Julia's standard library does not support true multithreading due to its GIL (Global Interpreter Lock), but it does support multicore parallelism via the `@threads` macro or `Distributed` package. However, for this problem, we are using a channel and `@async` from Julia's async functions to simulate multithreading in a single threaded environment.","status":200,"tokens":[0,455],"elapsed":4.478727506,"_type":"aimessage"}]
