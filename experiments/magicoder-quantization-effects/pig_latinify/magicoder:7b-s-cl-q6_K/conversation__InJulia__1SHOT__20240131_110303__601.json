Otherwise, move the first consonant to the end and append \"ay\".\n    if islowercase(chars[1]) && (chars[1] in 'aeiou')\n        return string(word*\"way\")\n    elseif isuppercase(chars[1]) && (chars[1] in 'AEIOU')\n        return string(uppercase(word)*\"WAY\")\n    else\n        first_consonant = popfirst!(chars)\n        return string(join(chars), first_consonant, \"ay\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function `pig_latinify` uses `@sync begin ... @async ... end` to ensure that all the threads are synchronized. It then iterates over each word in the input vector using a for loop and applies the `pig_latin` function asynchronously (i.e., on separate threads) with `@async`.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function works by first checking if the first letter of the word is a vowel, and if so, appending \"way\" to it. If not, it moves the first consonant to the end of the word and appends \"ay\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,392],"elapsed":3.803634397,"_type":"aimessage"}]
