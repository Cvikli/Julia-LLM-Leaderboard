[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a DataFrame `df_cars` with car data with columns `manufacturer` and `model`.

Here is a Julia function to do so:\n\n```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars::DataFrame; instructions=\"\")\n    # Filter the dataframe to only include rows with manufacturer Audi and model as \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\"\n    df_selected = df_cars[df_cars.manufacturer .== \"audi\", :] .| df_cars.model .in([\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"])\n  \n    # Create a new column in the DataFrame that indicates whether each row is an \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\"\n    if instructions == \"\" || instructions == \"true\"\n        df_selected[:, :audi_a4_type] = [true for _ in 1:size(df_selected)[1]]\n    elseif instructions == \"false\"\n        df_selected[:, :audi_a4_type] = [false for _ in 1:size(df_selected)[1]]\n    end\n\n    return df_selected\nend\n```\nYou can call this function with the DataFrame as the argument.
