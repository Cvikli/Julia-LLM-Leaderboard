Here's an example of how you could implement this:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    df_cars = filter(row -> row.manufacturer == \"audi\" && (row.model == \"a4\" || row.model == \"a4 quattro\"), df_cars)\n    \n    for i in eachrow(df_cars)\n        @set! i.audi_a4_type = true\n    end\n    \n    return df_cars\nend\n```\n\nThis function first filters `df_cars` to only include rows where the manufacturer is \"audi\" and the model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". Then it adds a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` for all of these rows.","status":200,"tokens":[0,216],"elapsed":1.721507195,"_type":"aimessage"}]
