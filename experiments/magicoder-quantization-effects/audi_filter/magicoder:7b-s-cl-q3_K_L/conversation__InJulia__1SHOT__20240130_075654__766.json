[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a DataFrame `df_cars` with car data with columns `manufacturer` and `model`. Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

The resulting data frame is transformed by the `@select` macro, which creates a new column `audi_a4_type`.\n\nFinally, this resultant DataFrame is concatenated with the original DataFrame using `hcat` function and returned. \n\nPlease note that you have to replace \"Audi\" and [\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"] in the above code with actual strings as Julia is case-sensitive.","status":200,"tokens":[0,273],"elapsed":2.182528426,"_type":"aimessage"}]
