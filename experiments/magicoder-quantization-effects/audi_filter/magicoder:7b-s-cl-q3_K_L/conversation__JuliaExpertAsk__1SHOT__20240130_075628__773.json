Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    df = @from df_cars begin \n        @where (:manufacturer == \"audi\") & (:model in [\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"])\n        @select(:manufacturer, :model => ByRow() -> true)\n    end |> @as(df => DataFrame)\n\n    return df\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `@from`, `@where`, and `@select` macros from the `DataFramesMeta` package. The `@where` statement filters out rows where \"manufacturer\" is not \"audi\". The `@select` statement creates a new column called \"audi_a4_type\" that contains `true`. \n\nThe function then returns the modified DataFrame.\n\nTo use this function, simply call it with your DataFrame as an argument:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = [... # Your DataFrame goes here]\ndf_result = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,245],"elapsed":1.966681269,"_type":"aimessage"}]
