Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can use the following code to achieve this:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\n# Create your function\nfunction audi_filter(df::DataFrame)\n    # Filter down the dataset to only include Audi A4 and A4 Quattro \n    df_filtered = filter(row -> (row.manufacturer == \"Audi\" && (lowercase(String(row.model)) in [\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"])), df)\n    \n    # Add a new column to indicate that it's an Audi A4 or A4 Quattro \n    df_filtered[:audi_a4_type] = true\n\n    return df_filtered\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, we first filter `df` such that only rows where the manufacturer is \"Audi\" and the model is either \"A4\" or \"A4 Quattro\" are included in `df_filtered`. We then add a new column `audi_a4_type` to `df_filtered` that equals `true` for all rows. Finally, we return `df_filtered`, which now includes the additional column and filtered data. \n\nYou can use this function on any DataFrame `df` as follows:\n```julia\ndf_cars = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,301],"elapsed":2.458206683,"_type":"aimessage"}]
