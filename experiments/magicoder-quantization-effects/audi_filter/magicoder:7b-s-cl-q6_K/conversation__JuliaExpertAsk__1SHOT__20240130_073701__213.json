Then it creates a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all these filtered rows. Finally, it returns the resulting DataFrame.\n\nLet's test this function using the following code:\n```julia\n# Assuming df_cars is already defined and populated with car data.\ndf_new = audi_filter(df_cars)\ndisplay(df_new) # Prints out filtered dataframe.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,232],"elapsed":2.242657375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
