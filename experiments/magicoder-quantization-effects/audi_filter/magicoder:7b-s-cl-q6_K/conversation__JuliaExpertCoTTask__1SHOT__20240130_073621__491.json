Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\ndf_cars = DataFrame(manufacturer=[\"audi\", \"audi\", \"bmw\", \"audi\", \"audi\", \"ford\", \"audi\", \"audi\", \"toyota\", \"audi\"],\n    model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"3 series\", \"a4 quattro\", \"q7\", \"fusion\", \"tt\", \"a4\", \"corolla\", \"a4 quattro\"])\naudi_filter(df_cars)","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution using Julia.\n\n```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    df_cars[:audi_a4_type] = (df_cars.manufacturer .== \"audi\") & (df_cars.model .∈ [\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"]) \n    return df_cars\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by using the DataFrames package's ability to apply operations element-wise on DataFrame columns. The `.==` operator compares every element in the `manufacturer` column of `df_cars` with \"audi\" and returns a boolean array where `true` indicates that the manufacturer is \"audi\". \n\nThe `.∈` operator checks whether each value in the `model` column is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\", which again returns a boolean array. This array is then combined with the first boolean array using `&`, which ensures only rows where both conditions are true will be included in the result. \n\nThe resulting boolean array is used to create a new `audi_a4_type` column, which is `true` for all these rows and `false` otherwise. The function then returns the modified DataFrame with the new column added.","status":200,"tokens":[0,278],"elapsed":2.729866892,"_type":"aimessage"}]
