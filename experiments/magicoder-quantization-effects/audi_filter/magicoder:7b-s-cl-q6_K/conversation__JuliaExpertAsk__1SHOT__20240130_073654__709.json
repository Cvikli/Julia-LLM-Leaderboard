Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is an example of how you can achieve this:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars::DataFrame) \n    df = filter(r -> (r.manufacturer == \"audi\") && ((r.model == \"a4\") || (r.model == \"quattro\")), df_cars)\n    df[:audi_a4_type] = true\n    return df\nend\n```\nThis function uses the filter method to select rows from the DataFrame where the manufacturer is \"audi\" and the model is either \"a4\" or \"quattro\". Then it adds a new column `audi_a4_type` which will be `true` for all selected rows. Finally, it returns the updated DataFrame.\n\nYou can use this function like so: \n```julia\ndf = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,205],"elapsed":1.977877078,"_type":"aimessage"}]
