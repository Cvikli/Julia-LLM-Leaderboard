Here is how you could implement this:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df::DataFrame)\n    # Filter rows where manufacturer equals \"audi\" and model in (\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\")\n    df = filter(row -> row.manufacturer == \"audi\" && (row.model == \"a4\" || row.model == \"a4 quattro\"), df)\n    \n    # Add a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals true across all rows\n    transform!(df, :model => ByRow(x -> x==\"a4\") => :audi_a4_type)\n    \n    return df\nend\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing your DataFrame to it:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(manufacturer=[1,2,3,\"audi\",\"audi\", 5], model=[\"a6\", \"a4\", \"a4 quattro\", \"a4\", \"a6\", \"a8\"])\n\ndf_filtered = audi_filter(df)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,278],"elapsed":2.656119723,"_type":"aimessage"}]
