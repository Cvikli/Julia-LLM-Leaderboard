Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can do this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, DataFramesMeta\n\nfunction audi_filter(df::DataFrame)\n    df = @where(df, :manufacturer .== \"audi\")\n    df[:audi_a4_type] = @inwhere(df, :model .in (\"a4\", \"quattro\"))\n    \n    return df\nend\n```\nThis function will filter the DataFrame `df` down to only rows where the manufacturer is \"audi\" and the model is either \"a4\" or \"quattro\". It then adds a new column called `:audi_a4_type`, which is `true` for each row where the conditions are met.\n\nTo use this function, you would call it like this:\n```julia\ndf = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,195],"elapsed":1.769831156,"_type":"aimessage"}]
