Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    df_audi = filter(row -> row.manufacturer == \"audi\" && (row.model == \"a4\" || row.model == \"a4 quattro\"), df_cars)\n    df_audi[:audi_a4_type] = true\n    return df_audi\nend\n```\n\nThis function `audi_filter` first filters the input DataFrame (`df_cars`) to keep only the rows where manufacturer is \"audi\" and model is \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". Then it adds a new column `:audi_a4_type` with value `true`. Finally, it returns the resulting DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,177],"elapsed":1.999616103,"_type":"aimessage"}]
