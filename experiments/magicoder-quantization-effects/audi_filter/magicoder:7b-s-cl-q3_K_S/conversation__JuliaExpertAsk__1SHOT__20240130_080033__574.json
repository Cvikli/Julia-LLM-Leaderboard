Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can accomplish this using the DataFrames package in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Pandas, Tables\nfunction audi_filter(df::DataFrame)\n    # filter to only Audi a4 or quattro\n    df = filter(r-> (r.manufacturer == \"audi\" && \n                      (lowercase(string(r.model))==\"a4\" || lowercase(string(r.model))==\"quattro\")), df)\n    \n    # create new column with true for the filtered rows\n    df[:, :audi_a4_type] = convert(Vector{Bool}, ones(size(df)[1])) \n    \n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function `audi_filter` first filters out all rows that are not from Audi or do not have the model \"a4\" or \"quattro\". Then it creates a new column `audi_a4_type` and sets it to `true` for those rows. Finally, it returns the resulting DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,235],"elapsed":1.84592378,"_type":"aimessage"}]
