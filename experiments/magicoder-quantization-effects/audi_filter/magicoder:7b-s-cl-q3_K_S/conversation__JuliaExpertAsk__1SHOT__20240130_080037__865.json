Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem using Pandas which is one of the most popular libraries in Python for data manipulation and analysis. Here's how you could implement it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef audi_filter(df_cars):\n    df_cars = df_cars[df_cars['manufacturer'] == 'audi']\n    df_cars.loc[:,'audi_a4_type'] = np.where((df_cars['model'].str.startswith('a4')), True, False)\n    return df_cars\n```\nThe `np.where` function checks if the model starts with 'a4'. If it does, it sets the value in that row's new column to `True`, otherwise it sets it to `False`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,182],"elapsed":1.432685102,"_type":"aimessage"}]
