Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

Then, you can create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals true across all rows. Here's how you might do it:\n\n```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df)\n    df_sub = filter(row -> row.manufacturer == \"audi\" && (row.model == \"a4\" || row.model == \"a4 quattro\"), eachrow(df))\n    \n    for i in 1:size(df_sub,1)\n        df_sub[i, :audi_a4_type] = true\n    end\n    \n    return df_sub\nend\n```\nIn the function above, we first create a new DataFrame `df_sub` that only contains rows where manufacturer is \"audi\" and model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". We then iterate over each row in this DataFrame and set the column `:audi_a4_type` to true.\n\nYou can test it with your data:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(manufacturer=[\"audi\", \"audi\", \"bmw\", \"audi\", \"audi\", \"ford\", \"audi\", \"audi\", \"toyota\", \"audi\"],\n    model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"3 series\", \"a4 quattro\", \"q7\", \"fusion\", \"tt\", \"a4\", \"corolla\", \"a4 quattro\"])\n\ndf_cars = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```\n\nNote that your original `df_cars` is not modified. This function returns a new DataFrame `df_sub` which includes the rows from `df_cars` where manufacturer is \"audi\" and model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\", as well as a column `:audi_a4_type` set to true for all of these rows.","status":200,"tokens":[0,454],"elapsed":4.098169389,"_type":"aimessage"}]
