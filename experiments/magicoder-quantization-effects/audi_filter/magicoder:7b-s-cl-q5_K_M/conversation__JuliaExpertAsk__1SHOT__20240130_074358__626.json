Then we define our function `audi_filter()`. Inside this function, we use Julia's built-in filtering functionality from the DataFrames package to only include rows where the manufacturer is \"audi\" and model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". \n\nWe then add a new column (`:audi_a4_type`) to our filtered DataFrame, setting it equal to `true` for all rows. Finally, we return our modified DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,393],"elapsed":3.481307154,"_type":"aimessage"}]
