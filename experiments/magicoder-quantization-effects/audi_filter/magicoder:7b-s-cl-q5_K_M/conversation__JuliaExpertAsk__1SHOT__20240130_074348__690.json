Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can implement this using the DataFrames package in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, CategoricalArrays\n\nfunction audi_filter(df::DataFrame)\n    df = filter(r -> r.manufacturer == \"audi\", df)\n    df[:audi_a4_type] = [row.model in [\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"] for row in eachrow(df)]\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we first filter the DataFrame `df` to only include rows where the `manufacturer` is `\"audi\"`. Then, we create a new column `audi_a4_type`, which equals `true` for every row if and only if the model of that car is in `[\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"]`.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(manufacturer=[string(i) for i in 1:5], model=[\"a3\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"a8\", \"a4 quattro\"])\nfiltered_df = audi_filter(df)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,261],"elapsed":2.29485982,"_type":"aimessage"}]
