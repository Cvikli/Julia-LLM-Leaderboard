Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution using pandas library:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef audi_filter(df_cars):\n    df_filtered = df_cars[df_cars['manufacturer'].str.lower() == 'audi']\n    df_filtered = df_filtered[df_filtered['model'].isin(['a4', 'a4 quattro'])].copy()\n    \n    # Create a new column audi_a4_type\n    df_filtered['audi_a4_type'] = True\n    \n    return df_filtered\n```\nThis function filters the DataFrame `df_cars` first by manufacturer and then by model. It converts all characters to lower case for comparison, so that it doesn't matter if \"Audi\", \"audi\" or any other variations are used in the data. Then, it checks if 'model' is either 'a4' or 'a4 quattro'. If these models exist, it creates a new column `audi_a4_type` and sets its value to True across all rows. The resulting DataFrame is returned.\n\nYou can call this function like so:\n```python\ndf_cars = pd.DataFrame({'manufacturer': ['Audi', 'BMW', 'Audi', 'Tesla'], \n                       'model': ['a4', '3 Series', 'a4 quattro', 'S']})\nresulting_df = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,333],"elapsed":2.918857109,"_type":"aimessage"}]
