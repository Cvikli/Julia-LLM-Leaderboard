[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a DataFrame `df_cars` with car data with columns `manufacturer` and `model`. Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

It then adds a new column `:audi_a4_type => true` to this filtered dataframe. Finally, it returns the resulting DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,259],"elapsed":2.074738084,"_type":"aimessage"}]
