The `.==` operator checks for exact equality and the `.∈` operator checks if an element is in a collection of values. \n\nYou can call `audi_filter(df_cars)` on your DataFrame df_cars to get the filtered DataFrame with new column `audi_a4_type`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,234],"elapsed":1.83888094,"_type":"aimessage"}]
