Then it creates a new column `:audi_a4_type` with value `true`. Finally, it returns the updated DataFrame. \n\nPlease note that you need to have the DataFrames package installed in your Julia environment to use this function. If not, install it using Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\").","status":200,"tokens":[0,211],"elapsed":1.676387939,"_type":"aimessage"}]
