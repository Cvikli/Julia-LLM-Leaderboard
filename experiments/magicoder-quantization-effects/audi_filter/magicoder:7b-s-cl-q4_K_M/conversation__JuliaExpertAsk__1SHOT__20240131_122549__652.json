Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution using the pandas library:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef audi_filter(df_cars):\n    # Filter down to only Audi A4 and A4 Quattro\n    df_audi = df_cars[(df_cars['manufacturer'] == 'Audi') & (df_cars['model'].isin(['a4', 'a4 quattro']))]\n    \n    # Create a new column for type\n    df_audi['audi_a4_type'] = True\n    \n    return df_audi\n```\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```python\ndf_cars = pd.DataFrame({\n  'manufacturer': ['Audi', 'BMW', 'Audi', 'Audi'],\n  'model': ['a4', '3 series', 'a4 quattro', 'a6']\n})\n\nprint(audi_filter(df_cars))\n```\n\nThis will print:\n\n    manufacturer model audi_a4_type\n0       Audi     a4             True\n2       Audi  a4 quattro          True\n\nNote that the function is case-sensitive. Make sure your data matches this if you have different casing. Also, keep in mind that 'isin' method checks for exact match so it will not include models like 'A4', 'A4Limited', etc. If such cases are present, consider using a regular expression or an fuzzy matching library to handle variations in model names.","status":200,"tokens":[0,340],"elapsed":2.71275257,"_type":"aimessage"}]
