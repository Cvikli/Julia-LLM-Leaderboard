Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

The function `audi_filter` will filter rows based on the manufacturer and model, then create a new column indicating whether they are Audi A4s, and finally return the resulting DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,282],"elapsed":2.261833766,"_type":"aimessage"}]
