Here is an example solution:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\n# Assuming df_cars is already defined\nfunction audi_filter(df::DataFrame)\n    # Filter to rows where manufacturer == \"audi\" and model is either \"a4\" or \"quattro\"\n    df = filter(r -> (r.manufacturer == \"audi\" && (r.model == \"a4\" || r.model == \"quattro\")), df)\n\n    # Create a new column called audi_a4_type which equals true\n    df[:audi_a4_type] = true\n    \n    return df\nend\n```\nYou can then call this function with your DataFrame:\n```julia\ndf_cars_filtered = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,200],"elapsed":1.604138598,"_type":"aimessage"}]
