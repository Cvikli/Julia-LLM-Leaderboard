Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Pipe\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars) \n    df = @pipeline df_cars |>\n        filter(:manufacturer .== \"audi\") |>\n        filter([:model] .== [\"a4\", \"quattro\"]) |> \n        mutate(audi_a4_type = true)\nend\n```\n\nThis solution uses the `DataFrames` package along with a few extra packages for simplicity and ease of use. The `@pipeline` macro is used to chain operations in a pipeline manner, filtering first on manufacturer, then on model, then mutating to create a new column with true across all rows where both conditions are met. \n\nYou can call the function like so:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(manufacturer = [\"audi\", \"toyota\", \"volkswagen\", \"audi\", \"bmw\"], model = [\"a4\", \"corolla\", \"golf\", \"quattro\", \"x3\"]) \ndf_filtered = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[141,262],"elapsed":2.190049268,"_type":"aimessage"}]
