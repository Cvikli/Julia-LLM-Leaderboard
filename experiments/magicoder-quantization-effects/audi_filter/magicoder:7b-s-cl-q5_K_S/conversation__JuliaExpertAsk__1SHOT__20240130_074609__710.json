Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem using pandas, which is a powerful data manipulation library in python. Here is an example of how you can write your function:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef audi_filter(df_cars):\n    # Filter down the dataset to only \"audi\" manufacturer and model being \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\"\n    df_filtered = df_cars[(df_cars['manufacturer'] == 'audi') & \n                          (df_cars['model'].isin(['a4', 'a4 quattro']))]\n    \n    # Create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals True across all rows.\n    df_filtered['audi_a4_type'] = True\n    \n    return df_filtered\n```\n\nNow, you can use this function on your DataFrame `df_cars`:\n\n```python\n# Assuming df_cars is your original DataFrame\ndf_cars = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```\n\nThis will result in a new DataFrame with the same columns as `df_cars`, but only containing rows where the manufacturer is \"audi\" and the model is \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\", along with an extra column called 'audi_a4_type' that equals True for all these rows.","status":200,"tokens":[0,302],"elapsed":2.61199815,"_type":"aimessage"}]
