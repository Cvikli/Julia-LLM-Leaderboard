Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could implement this using Julia with DataFrames.jl package:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df::DataFrame)\n    # Filter the dataframe for Audi cars and add a new column\n    df = filter(row -> (row[:manufacturer] == \"audi\" && row[:model] in [\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"]), df)\n    df[:audi_a4_type] = true\n    return df\nend\n```\nThis function first filters the DataFrame to include only rows where the manufacturer is \"audi\" and the model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". It then adds a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals true across all rows. Finally, it returns the resulting DataFrame.\n\nNote: This function assumes that the input DataFrame has columns named \"manufacturer\" and \"model\". If your actual DataFrame's column names are different, you should adjust this code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[141,224],"elapsed":1.993613393,"_type":"aimessage"}]
