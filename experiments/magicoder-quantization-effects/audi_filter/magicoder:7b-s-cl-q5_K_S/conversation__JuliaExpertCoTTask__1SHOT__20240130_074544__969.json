Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

Then we define the function `audi_filter` that takes a DataFrame as input and returns a new modified DataFrame. \n\nWe use the .== operator to check if the manufacturer column equals \"audi\" and then we use the | (or) operator to filter rows where model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". We add these conditions with & (and) to ensure both are true for a row to be selected. This selection creates a new column `audi_a4_type` in our DataFrame, and we set this equal to `true` across all selected rows.\n\nFinally, the function returns the modified DataFrame. \n\nYou can use this function by passing your `df_cars` DataFrame into it like so: `audi_filter(df_cars)`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,284],"elapsed":2.469270174,"_type":"aimessage"}]
