Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df::DataFrame)\n    filter!(r -> r.manufacturer == \"audi\" && (r.model == \"a4\" || r.model == \"a4 quattro\"), df)\n    df[:audi_a4_type] = true\n    return df\nend\n```\nThis function first filters the DataFrame to include only those rows where `manufacturer` is `\"audi\"` and `model` is `\"a4\"` or `\"a4 quattro\"`. It then creates a new column called `audi_a4_type` and sets it equal to `true` for all selected rows. Finally, it returns the modified DataFrame.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(manufacturer = [\"bmw\", \"audi\", \"volkswagen\", \"audi\"], model = [\"a3\", \"a4\", \"a1\", \"a4 quattro\"])\nfiltered_df = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,249],"elapsed":2.148609036,"_type":"aimessage"}]
