Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, DataFramesMeta\n\nfunction audi_filter(df::DataFrame)\n    @where!(df, :manufacturer .== \"audi\" & (:model .== \"a4\" | :model .== \"a4 quattro\"))\n    \n    # Create new column 'audi_a4_type' equal to true for all rows \n    df[:audi_a4_type] = true\n    \n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `@where!` macro from `DataFramesMeta.jl`, which allows you to filter a DataFrame in place using a boolean expression. Here we are filtering for rows where manufacturer is \"audi\" and model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". Then we create a new column `audi_a4_type` equal to true across all the rows of the filtered DataFrame.\n\nYou can call this function with your DataFrame as argument:\n```julia\ndf_cars = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,245],"elapsed":2.071019759,"_type":"aimessage"}]
