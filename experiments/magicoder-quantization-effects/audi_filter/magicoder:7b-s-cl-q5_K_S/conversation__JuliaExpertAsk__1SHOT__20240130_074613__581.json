Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could solve this problem in Julia using DataFrames.jl package:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Tables\n\nfunction audi_filter(df::DataFrame)\n    df = filter(r -> r.manufacturer == \"audi\" && (r.model == \"a4\" || r.model == \"a4 quattro\"), df)\n    df[:audi_a4_type] = true\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function first filters the DataFrame to only include rows where `manufacturer` is \"audi\" and `model` is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". Then it creates a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all these filtered rows. Finally, it returns the modified DataFrame.\n\nHere's how to use this function:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(manufacturer=[], model=[])\n# Add your data here...\ndf_filtered = audi_filter(df)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,231],"elapsed":1.995693708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
