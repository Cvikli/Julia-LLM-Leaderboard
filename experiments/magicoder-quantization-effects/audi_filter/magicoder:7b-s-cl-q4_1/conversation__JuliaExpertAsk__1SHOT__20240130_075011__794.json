Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can achieve this using the following code in Julia:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df::DataFrame)\n    df = filter((row) -> (row[:manufacturer] == \"audi\" && \n                         ((row[:model] == \"a4\") || (row[:model] == \"quattro\"))), df)\n    df[:audi_a4_type] = [true for _ in eachindex(df)]\n    return df\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `filter` function from DataFrames.jl to filter out rows that do not meet the condition of having \"audi\" as the manufacturer and either \"a4\" or \"quattro\" as the model. Then it creates a new column `audi_a4_type` that is set to true for all rows. Finally, it returns the modified DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,193],"elapsed":1.552559497,"_type":"aimessage"}]
