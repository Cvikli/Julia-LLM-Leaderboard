Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can achieve this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    df_cars[!, :audi_a4_type] = df_cars[:, 1].== \"Audi\" .& df_cars[:, 2].in([\"A4\", \"A4 quattro\"])\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the bitwise and operator `.&` to ensure that both conditions for manufacturer being \"Audi\" and model being \"A4 or A4 quattro\" must be met. If either condition is not fulfilled, `audi_a4_type` remains as `false`.\n\nYou can use this function on your DataFrame like so:\n```julia\ndf_cars = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,185],"elapsed":1.509681515,"_type":"aimessage"}]
