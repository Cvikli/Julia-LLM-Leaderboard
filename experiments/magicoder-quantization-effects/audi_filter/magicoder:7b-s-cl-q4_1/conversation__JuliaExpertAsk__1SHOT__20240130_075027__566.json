Here is how you could do it:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\n# Assuming df_cars is your DataFrame\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars) \n    # Use filter function to get rows where manufacturer is \"audi\" and model is \"a4\" or \"quattro\"\n    filtered = filter(row -> row.manufacturer == \"audi\" && (row.model == \"a4\" || row.model == \"quattro\"), df_cars)\n    \n    # Add a new column to the DataFrame\n    filtered[:audi_a4_type] = true\n    \n    return filtered\nend\n```\nYou can use this function by calling it with your DataFrame as an argument:\n\n```julia\ndf_result = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,204],"elapsed":1.656033025,"_type":"aimessage"}]
