Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might define this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    # filter data frame to only include \"audi\" manufacturers and model as \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\"\n    df_a4_audi = @where(df_cars, :manufacturer => isequal(\"audi\"), :model => isin([\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"]))\n\n    # create new column \"audi_a4_type\" that equals true across all rows\n    insert!(df_a4_audi, 3, :audi_a4_type => trues(size(df_a4_audi)[1]))\n\n    return df_a4_audi\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `@where` macro to filter the DataFrame. The `isequal` and `isin` functions are used in the filtering condition respectively to check for exact matches and inclusion of items within a list. The `trues` function generates a vector of booleans all set as true, which is then inserted into the new column.\n\nRemember to call your function with your DataFrame as an argument like this: \n```julia\ndf_cars = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,295],"elapsed":2.380419333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
