Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can do this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Query\n\nfunction audi_filter(df::DataFrame)\n    # filter to only rows with manufacturer \"audi\" and model being \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\"\n    df = @from i in df begin\n        where (i.manufacturer == \"audi\") & \n             ((i.model == \"a4\") | (i.model == \"a4 quattro\"))\n        select { :_, :, :audi_a4_type => true }\n    end\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we use the `@from` macro from Query.jl to perform a query operation on our DataFrame. The `where` clause filters down the dataset to only include rows where `manufacturer` is \"audi\" and `model` is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\".\n\nThe `select` clause adds a new column named `audi_a4_type` to all of these rows, setting its value to true.\n\nFinally, the function returns the modified DataFrame. \n\nRemember that you have to install Query.jl package before running this code using Pkg.add(\"Query\").","status":200,"tokens":[0,274],"elapsed":2.371323662,"_type":"aimessage"}]
