Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

Additionally, it will have an additional column named `audi_a4_type` that is `true` for all these rows.","status":200,"tokens":[0,301],"elapsed":5.209529341,"_type":"aimessage"}]
