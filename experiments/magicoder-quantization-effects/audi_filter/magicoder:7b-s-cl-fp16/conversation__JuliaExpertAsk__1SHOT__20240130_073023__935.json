Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can achieve this using the following code in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df::DataFrame)\n    df_audi = filter(row -> row.manufacturer == \"Audi\" && (row.model == \"a4\" || row.model == \"a4 quattro\"), df)\n\n    # Add new column for type of Audi a4 \n    df_audi[:audi_a4_type] = true\n\n    return df_audi\nend\n```\nThis function will filter rows in the DataFrame where `manufacturer` is \"Audi\" and `model` is \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". It then adds a new column named `audi_a4_type` to these rows with value `true`. The filtered DataFrame, which includes the newly added column, is returned.\n\nNote: Julia is case-sensitive. In this function, I've used uppercase \"Audi\" for consistency but you can use whatever case suits your requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,230],"elapsed":4.004250586,"_type":"aimessage"}]
