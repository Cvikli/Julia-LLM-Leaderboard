Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem using the Pandas library in Python:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef audi_filter(df):\n    df_audi = df[(df['manufacturer'] == 'audi') & (df['model'].isin(['a4', 'a4 quattro']))]\n    df_audi['audi_a4_type'] = True\n    return df_audi\n```\nThis function creates a new DataFrame, `df_audi`, that only includes rows where the `manufacturer` is \"audi\" and the `model` is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". Then it adds a new column `audi_a4_type` with all values set to `True`. Finally, it returns this modified DataFrame.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that your data frame's index (or row number) does not need to be preserved. If you want to preserve the original row order in your DataFrame, you might have to use a different approach.","status":200,"tokens":[0,223],"elapsed":3.881329975,"_type":"aimessage"}]
