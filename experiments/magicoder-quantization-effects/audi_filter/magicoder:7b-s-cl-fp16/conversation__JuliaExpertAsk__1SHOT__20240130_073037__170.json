Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can do this task using the `filter!` function from DataFrames.jl package to filter down your dataset and then using `transform!` function to create a new column. Here is how you could write such a function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    # Filter out rows where manufacturer is \"audi\" and model is \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\"\n    filter!(r -> r.manufacturer == \"audi\" && (r.model == \"a4\" || r.model == \"a4 quattro\"), df_cars)\n\n    # Create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals true across all rows\n    transform!(df_cars, :audi_a4_type => (x -> true, Bool))\n\n    return df_cars\nend\n```\nYou can call this function with your DataFrame as argument. Example: \n\n```julia\ndf_filtered = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,240],"elapsed":4.195277486,"_type":"aimessage"}]
