[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a DataFrame `df_cars` with car data with columns `manufacturer` and `model`.

The `@select` clause then adds a new column `audi_a4_type`, which is true in all of these selected rows.\n\nFinally, the function uses the `outerjoin` function from the `DataFrames.jl` package to combine the original DataFrame with the modified one that contains only \"Audi\" models. This is done by joining on the index column, which by default is assumed to be a unique identifier for each row in the DataFrame. If there are duplicate indices, then `makeunique=true` ensures that duplicates are handled in a way that preserves original intent (which was not specified here). \n\nThe output of this function will be a new DataFrame where all rows with manufacturer \"Audi\" and model being \"a4 or “a4 quattro” have an extra column `audi_a4_type` equals true.","status":200,"tokens":[0,410],"elapsed":7.267764381,"_type":"aimessage"}]
