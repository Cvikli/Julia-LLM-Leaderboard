Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\ndf_cars = DataFrame(manufacturer=[\"audi\", \"audi\", \"bmw\", \"audi\", \"audi\", \"ford\", \"audi\", \"audi\", \"toyota\", \"audi\"],\n    model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"3 series\", \"a4 quattro\", \"q7\", \"fusion\", \"tt\", \"a4\", \"corolla\", \"a4 quattro\"])\naudi_filter(df_cars)","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem by using the `DataFrames` package in Julia. Here is how you might do it:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, DataFramesMeta\n\nfunction audi_filter(df::DataFrame)\n    filter!(r -> r.manufacturer == \"audi\" && (r.model == \"a4\" || r.model == \"a4 quattro\"), df)\n    df[:audi_a4_type] = true\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function first uses the `filter!` function from DataFramesMeta to filter out all rows that don't match your criteria (manufacturer is \"audi\" and model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\"). Then it sets a new column `audi_a4_type` to true for all remaining rows. Finally, the function returns the resulting DataFrame.\n\nNote: This code assumes that you have already added the DataFramesMeta package to your environment by running `using DataFramesMeta`. If you haven't done this yet, run `Pkg.add(\"DataFramesMeta\")` in the Julia REPL before trying it out.","status":200,"tokens":[0,254],"elapsed":4.435818788,"_type":"aimessage"}]
