The condition checks if the manufacturer column equals \"audi\" and if the model column either equals \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\".\n\nThen we add a new column `audi_a4_type` to this filtered DataFrame and set its value across all rows to be `true`. Finally, we return the resulting DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,213],"elapsed":3.679057065,"_type":"aimessage"}]
