Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia solution for your problem:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Pipe # assuming you have these packages installed\n\nfunction audi_filter(df::DataFrame)\n    df = @pipe df |> \n            filter((x) -> (lowercase(x.manufacturer) == \"audi\" && \n                           lowercase(x.model) in [\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"])) |> \n            eachrow(df) |> \n            mutate!(_, :audi_a4_type => true)\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Pipe` package for readability. The `@pipe` macro allows chaining operations on data frames, allowing you to write functions that manipulate large datasets without cluttering your code with temporary variables and long pipe statements. This is particularly useful when working with large DataFrames. \n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(manufacturer=[\"audi\", \"toyota\", \"audi\", \"bmw\"], model=[\"a4\", \"corolla\", \"x1\", \"x3\"])\nfiltered_df = audi_filter(df)\n```\nAfter running `audi_filter`, the resulting DataFrame will have an additional column named `audi_a4_type` where all values are `true`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,304],"elapsed":2.352609194,"_type":"aimessage"}]
