Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem using the following code in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    df_cars[:audi_a4_type] = (df_cars.manufacturer .== \"Audi\") & (df_cars.model .in [\"A4\", \"A4 Quattro\"])\n    return df_cars\nend\n```\n\nThis function first creates a new boolean column in the DataFrame named `audi_a4_type`. Then it sets this column to `true` if and only if both the manufacturer is \"Audi\" and the model is either \"A4\" or \"A4 Quattro\". Finally, it returns the updated DataFrame.\nPlease note that case sensitivity might affect your result, hence ensure that you check with respect to case-sensitive data.","status":200,"tokens":[0,188],"elapsed":1.442955575,"_type":"aimessage"}]
