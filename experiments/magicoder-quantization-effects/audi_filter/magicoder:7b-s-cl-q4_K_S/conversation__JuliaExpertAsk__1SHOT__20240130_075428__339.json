A new column `audi_a4_type` is created that contains boolean values (True if the car is an 'Audi' A4, and False otherwise).\n2. The DataFrame `df_cars` is modified with the new column.\n3. The function returns the modified DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,202],"elapsed":1.566937843,"_type":"aimessage"}]
