Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could write this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Query\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    df = filter(r -> r.manufacturer == \"audi\", df_cars)\n    df = filter(r -> any(m -> m == \"a4\" || m == \"quattro\", split(r.model, ' ')), df)\n\n    for row in eachrow(df)\n        if occursin(\"a4\", row.model) || occursin(\"quattro\", row.model)\n            row.audi_a4_type = true\n        else\n            row.audi_a4_type = false\n        end\n    end\n\n    return df\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `filter` method from the Query package in Julia to filter rows that match specific conditions. The first condition filters for \"Audi\" as manufacturer, and the second one checks if \"a4\" or \"quattro\" is part of the model name. \n\nThen it iterates over each row of this filtered DataFrame, and adds a new column `audi_a4_type` which equals `true` for rows where \"Audi\" as manufacturer and \"a4\" or \"quattro\" in model. For those rows that don't match these conditions, the value is set to `false`.\n\nPlease note that you need to install and load Query package by using Pkg.add(\"Query\") before running this function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,336],"elapsed":2.543926033,"_type":"aimessage"}]
