Here is how you could do it:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    # Filter rows where manufacturer equals \"audi\" and model in [\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"]\n    df_filtered = filter(row -> row.manufacturer == \"audi\" && (row.model == \"a4\" || row.model == \"a4 quattro\"), df_cars)\n    \n    # Add a new column with true values\n    df_filtered[:, :audi_a4_type] = true\n    \n    return df_filtered\nend\n```\nThis function first filters the DataFrame to only include rows where the manufacturer is \"audi\" and the model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". Then it adds a new column `audi_a4_type` with all values being true. Finally, it returns the modified DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,248],"elapsed":1.828738001,"_type":"aimessage"}]
