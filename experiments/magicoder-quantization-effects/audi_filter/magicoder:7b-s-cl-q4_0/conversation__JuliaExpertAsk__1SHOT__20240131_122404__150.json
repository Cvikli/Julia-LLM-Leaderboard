Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use the pandas library in python to accomplish this task. Here is how you could do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef audi_filter(df_cars):\n    df_audi = df_cars[(df_cars['manufacturer'] == 'audi') & \n                      (df_cars['model'].isin(['a4', 'a4 quattro']))]\n    \n    # Create new column `audi_a4_type` with all values as True\n    df_audi['audi_a4_type'] = True\n    \n    return df_audi\n```\n\nThis function will filter the DataFrame to only include rows where the manufacturer is 'audi' and the model is either 'a4' or 'a4 quattro'. It then creates a new column named `audi_a4_type` with all values as True. Finally, it returns the resulting DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,204],"elapsed":1.529518531,"_type":"aimessage"}]
