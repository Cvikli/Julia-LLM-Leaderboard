Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can write this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Query\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    df_audi = @from i in df_cars begin \n        where (:manufacturer == \"audi\") && \n        (:model in [\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"])\n        select { :audi_a4_type => true }\n    end |> collect\n    \n    return vcat(df_cars, df_audi)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `@from` macro from the Query.jl package to filter rows in `df_cars` where `:manufacturer` is \"audi\" and `:model` is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". It then creates a new column `:audi_a4_type` that is true for all rows, and returns the result by concatenating it with the original DataFrame `df_cars`. \n\nPlease note you need to have installed Query.jl package in your Julia environment to run this function. If not, install it using Pkg.add(\"Query\").","status":200,"tokens":[0,251],"elapsed":1.886798314,"_type":"aimessage"}]
