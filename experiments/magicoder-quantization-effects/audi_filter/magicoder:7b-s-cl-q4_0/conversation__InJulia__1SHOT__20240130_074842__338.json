The expression `\"^a4$|^quattro$\"` is used as the regex pattern to match the model name. If it matches, then the value in this new column is set to `true`, otherwise it's `false`.\n- Finally, we return the resulting DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,281],"elapsed":2.11968146,"_type":"aimessage"}]
