The result is a vector with the count of rows for each model. \n\nTo use this function, you would first create your DataFrame and call it like so:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"A\", \"B\"]) # example data frame\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln.(counts)  # prints the counts of each model\n```\n\nThis will output: `[2, 2]` which corresponds to models A and B having 2 rows each.","status":200,"tokens":[0,232],"elapsed":1.831057255,"_type":"aimessage"}]
