Then, you can use the `nrow` function on each grouped dataframe to get the number of rows in that group. Here is an example:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n    counts = nrow.(grouped)\n    return counts\nend\n```\nThis function takes a dataframe as input and returns an array of integers, where the i-th integer is the number of rows in the i-th group. \n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will return an array with the counts for each model in `df_cars`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,203],"elapsed":1.600385347,"_type":"aimessage"}]
