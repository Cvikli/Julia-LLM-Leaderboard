This package provides functions for manipulating and analyzing structured datasets, which include data frames.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame) \n    counts = groupby(df, :model) |> \n        combine(_, length => \"count\", renamecols=false)\n    return counts\nend\n```\n\nIn the function above:\n- `groupby` is used to group rows of DataFrame df by the 'model' column.\n- `combine` is used to transform each grouped data into a single value (in this case, it's the length of each group). The result will be in a new DataFrame counts where each row corresponds to one model and the 'count' column represents the number of rows for that model.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"A\", \"B\"], price=[10, 20, 30, 40, 50])\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nHere counts will be a new DataFrame with columns `model` and `count`.\n\nRemember to install the required package using `Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\")` before trying to run this code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,318],"elapsed":2.561503505,"_type":"aimessage"}]
