The result is a new DataFrame where each row represents a unique model from the original DataFrame and its corresponding count of rows. \n\nTo use this function, you would pass your DataFrame as an argument:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"A\", \"C\", \"B\"]) # example dataframe\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will return a new DataFrame with columns `model` and `counts`, where each row represents a unique model from the original DataFrame and its corresponding count of rows.","status":200,"tokens":[0,240],"elapsed":1.916416856,"_type":"aimessage"}]
