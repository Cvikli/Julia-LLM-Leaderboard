The result is a new DataFrame where each row represents a unique model and its count. \n\nYou can use it like this:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"A\", \"B\", \"C\"])\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will give you a new DataFrame where each row represents a unique model and its count:\n\n| model | count |\n|-------|-------|\n| A     | 2     |\n| B     | 2     |\n| C     | 1     |","status":200,"tokens":[59,244],"elapsed":1.930819609,"_type":"aimessage"}]
