The result is a new DataFrame where each row corresponds to a unique model in the original DataFrame, and it contains a single column \"count\" which gives the number of rows in that group.\n\nPlease note that you need to install the necessary packages (like DataFrames) before using them in your Julia environment. You can do this by running `]add DataFrames CategoricalArrays` in the REPL.","status":200,"tokens":[0,202],"elapsed":1.579863293,"_type":"aimessage"}]
