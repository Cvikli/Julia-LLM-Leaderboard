The `combine` function then calculates the number of rows for each group (i.e., model) and returns it as a new DataFrame.\n\nYou would call this function like so:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"B\", \"A\"]) # example data frame\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will return a new DataFrame with columns `model` and `count`, where each row represents the number of rows for each model in the original DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,232],"elapsed":1.815317804,"_type":"aimessage"}]
