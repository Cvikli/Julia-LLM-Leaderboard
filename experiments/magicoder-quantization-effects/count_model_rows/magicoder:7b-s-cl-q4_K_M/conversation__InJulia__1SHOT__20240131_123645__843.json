Inside the function, we use the `countmap` function from the DataFrames package to count the number of occurrences of each unique value in the `model` column. The result is returned by the function.\n\nThe test at the end creates a sample DataFrame and applies our function to it, then prints out the resulting counts.","status":200,"tokens":[0,214],"elapsed":1.685671527,"_type":"aimessage"}]
