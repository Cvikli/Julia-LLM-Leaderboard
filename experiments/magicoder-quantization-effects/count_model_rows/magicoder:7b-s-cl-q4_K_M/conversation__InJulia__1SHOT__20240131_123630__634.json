Here is an example:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, CategoricalArrays\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = map(length, grouped)\n    return counts\nend\n\n# Usage example:\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", \"A\", \"B\", \"C\"])\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nIn this example, the `groupby` function will group rows that have the same value in the `model` column together. Then the `map` function is used to calculate how many rows are there for each group, which is equivalent to counting the number of times each model appears in the DataFrame. The result is a Vector of counts, where the ith element corresponds to the count of the ith unique value in the `model` column.","status":200,"tokens":[0,238],"elapsed":1.874695608,"_type":"aimessage"}]
