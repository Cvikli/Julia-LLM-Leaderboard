The `nrow` function is used to count the number of rows in a group. \n\nYou can call this function with your DataFrame like so:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"A\", \"B\"]) # example dataframe\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will return a new DataFrame with one row for each unique model in the original DataFrame, and a column named `count` that contains the number of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,225],"elapsed":1.759201676,"_type":"aimessage"}]
