It then returns an array of integers where each element is the number of rows in each group. \n\nFor example, if you have this DataFrame:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"Ford\", \"Toyota\", \"Chevrolet\", \"Ford\", \"Chevrolet\"])\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nIt will return `[2, 1, 1]` because there are two rows for Ford, one row for Toyota and one row for Chevrolet.","status":200,"tokens":[90,263],"elapsed":2.064047914,"_type":"aimessage"}]
