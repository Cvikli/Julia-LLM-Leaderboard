Here is an example of the code you would need to achieve this using the DataFrames library in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, CategoricalArrays  # assuming you have these packages installed\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = combine(grouped, size)[:x1]\nend\n```\nThis function first groups the DataFrame `df` by its column \"model\" using the `groupby` function. Then it uses the `combine` function to calculate the size of each group (i.e., how many rows there are for each model). Finally, it extracts and returns just the counts (:x1 in this case as DataFrames.jl will generate a temporary column named :x1)\n\nYou can then call your function with your dataframe:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"A\", \"B\", \"C\"])\nprintln(count_model_rows(df_cars)) # prints [2, 2, 1]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,250],"elapsed":1.998646077,"_type":"aimessage"}]
