The `nrow` function is then used on each of these groups to count how many rows there are for each model. \n\nYou can call this function with your DataFrame as follows:\n```julia\nmodels_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will return a Vector of integers where the i-th integer is the number of rows in the i-th group.","status":200,"tokens":[0,182],"elapsed":1.416728534,"_type":"aimessage"}]
