Then it uses the `combine` function to calculate the number of rows in each group (i.e., for each unique model). The result is a new DataFrame where each row represents a unique model, and there is a new column \"count\" that contains the number of rows associated with that model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,166],"elapsed":1.289390791,"_type":"aimessage"}]
