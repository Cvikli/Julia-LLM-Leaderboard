This method is applied to the 'model' column of the DataFrame.\n\nIf you are working with Julia, it would look something like this:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return countmap(df.model)[2]\nend\n\n# Assuming df is your DataFrame and 'model' is a column in the DataFrame\nprintln(count_model_rows(df))\n```\n\nThis function works by using the `countmap()` function from the DataFrames package, which returns a dictionary with keys as unique values in the specified column and values as their counts. The second element of this dictionary (indexed by 2) is returned to get the count for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,271],"elapsed":2.151730787,"_type":"aimessage"}]
