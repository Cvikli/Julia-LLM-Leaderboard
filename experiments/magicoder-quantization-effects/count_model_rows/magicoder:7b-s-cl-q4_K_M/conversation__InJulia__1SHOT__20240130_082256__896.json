The `combine` function is then used to calculate for each group (i.e., each unique model), how many rows there are (`nrow`). The result is a new DataFrame where each row corresponds to a model and has two columns: one for the model name, and another with the count of rows for that model.\n\nYou can then use this function like this:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"A\", \"C\", \"B\"], price=[100, 200, 300, 400, 500])\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nHere `result` will be a new DataFrame with two rows: the first row corresponding to model \"A\" and the second row corresponding to model \"B\". The first column of each row has the model name, while the second column has the count of rows for that model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,307],"elapsed":2.455977216,"_type":"aimessage"}]
