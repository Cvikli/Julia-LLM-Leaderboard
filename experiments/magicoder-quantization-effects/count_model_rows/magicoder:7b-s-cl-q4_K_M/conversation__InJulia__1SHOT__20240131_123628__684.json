We then use the `combine` function to calculate the number of rows (`length`) for each group and store it as a new column named `:count`. The result is returned as another DataFrame, where each row represents a unique value in the `model` column and its corresponding count of rows.\n\nNote that you need to ensure that your DataFrame has a categorical type for the model column. If not, you can convert it using:\n```julia\ndf[:model] = CategoricalArray(df[:model])\n```\nThis function assumes that `df_cars` is passed as an argument to the function and is of DataFrame type.","status":200,"tokens":[59,250],"elapsed":1.99808378,"_type":"aimessage"}]
