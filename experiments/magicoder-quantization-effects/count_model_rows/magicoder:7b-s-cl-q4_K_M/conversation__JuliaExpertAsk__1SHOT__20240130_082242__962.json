The `combine` function is then used on this grouped data to calculate the number of rows (represented as 1's) for each group, and these counts are returned as a Dict.\n  \nFor example if we have:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(model=[string('A', i) for i in 1:10], price=[i for i in 1:10])\ncount_model_rows(df)\n```\nThe output will be:\n`Dict(\"A1\" => 1, \"A2\" => 1, ... , \"A10\" => 1)` with the count of each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,268],"elapsed":2.151882055,"_type":"aimessage"}]
