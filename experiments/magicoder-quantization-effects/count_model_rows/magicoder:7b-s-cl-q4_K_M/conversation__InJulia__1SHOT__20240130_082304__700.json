You can install this package using the following command in Julia:\n```julia\nusing Pkg; Pkg.add(\"DataFrameInterface\")\n```\nNow we proceed to write the function `count_model_rows`. Here is a sample code that performs the task:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, DataFrameInterface\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model) # groups data by model \n    counts = combine(grouped, length) # calculates number of rows for each model\n    return counts\nend\n```\nNow you can call this function with your DataFrame `df_cars` as an argument:\n```julia\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThe `groupby` function groups the DataFrame by a given column or expression, and the `combine` function calculates some operation on each group. In this case, we are using the length function which returns the number of rows in a group. The result will be a new DataFrame where each row represents a unique value from your column (`model`) and the count of rows for that value.","status":200,"tokens":[0,300],"elapsed":2.402951787,"_type":"aimessage"}]
