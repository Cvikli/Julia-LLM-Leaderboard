Then it uses the `combine` function to calculate the number of rows for each group (i.e., for each unique model). The result is a new dataframe where each row represents a unique model, and there's a new column \"count\" that shows how many rows there are for that model.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"A\", \"C\", \"B\"])  # example dataframe\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis would give you a new dataframe `result` where each row represents a unique model and there's a column \"count\" that shows how many rows there are for that model. For instance, if the input dataframe is:\n```julia\n| model |\n|-------|\n| A     |\n| B     |\n| A     |\n| C     |\n| B     |\n```\nThe output would be:\n```julia\n| model | count |\n|-------|-------|\n| A     | 2     |\n| B     | 2     |\n| C     | 1     |\n```","status":200,"tokens":[90,358],"elapsed":2.839398797,"_type":"aimessage"}]
