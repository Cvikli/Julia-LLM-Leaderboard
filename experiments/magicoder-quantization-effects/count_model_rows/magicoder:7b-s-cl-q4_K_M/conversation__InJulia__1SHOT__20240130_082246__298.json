The result is a Vector of Int64, where each element corresponds to the number of rows in each group.\n\nYou can call this function with your DataFrame:\n```julia\nresults = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will return a Vector of Integers, showing how many rows are in each group. \n\nFor instance, if you run it on `df_cars`, the output will be `[2, 2, 1]`, indicating that there are 2 rows for models \"A\", \"B\" and 1 row for model \"C\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,304],"elapsed":2.436392397,"_type":"aimessage"}]
