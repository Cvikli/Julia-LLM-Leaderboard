The result is an array of integers representing the count for each group. \n\nTo use this function, you can call it with your DataFrame like so:\n```julia\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will return an array `counts` where each element is the number of rows in the corresponding model group.","status":200,"tokens":[0,203],"elapsed":1.602220585,"_type":"aimessage"}]
