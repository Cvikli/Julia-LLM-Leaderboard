Then, for each group (which represents a unique model), we calculate the number of rows in that group with the `size` function and return these sizes as a vector.\n\nIf you want to get a dictionary where the keys are the models and the values are the counts, you can modify this function like so:\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    Dict(zip(grouped.keys[1], map(x -> size(x)[1], grouped)))\nend\n```\n\nThis will return a dictionary where the keys are the unique models in the dataframe and the values are the counts of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,254],"elapsed":2.014297721,"_type":"aimessage"}]
