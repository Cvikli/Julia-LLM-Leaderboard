It then groups the DataFrame by the \"model\" column, counts the number of rows for each group (which are the same as the count for each model), and returns this grouped data.\nNote: The function assumes the `DataFrame` has already been sorted/grouped by 'model' before it is passed to the function.\n\nYou can call the function like this:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\",\"E\", \"F\"], \n                    othercols=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])\ncounted_data = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,321],"elapsed":2.54861152,"_type":"aimessage"}]
