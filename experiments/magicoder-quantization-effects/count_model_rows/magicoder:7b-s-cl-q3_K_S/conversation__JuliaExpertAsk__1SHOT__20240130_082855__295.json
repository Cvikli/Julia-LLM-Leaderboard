The number of rows (`nrows_per_group`) for each group is calculated using a list comprehension, where for each group the size method is used to calculate the number of rows. Finally, this list is returned.\n\nYou can call your function like this:\n```julia\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,187],"elapsed":1.473945591,"_type":"aimessage"}]
