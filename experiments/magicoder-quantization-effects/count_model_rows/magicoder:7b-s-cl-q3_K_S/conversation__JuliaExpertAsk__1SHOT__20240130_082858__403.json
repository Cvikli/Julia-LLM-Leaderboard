Then it iterates over each group, calculates the size of that group (i.e., how many rows are there for that model) and stores this information as a tuple along with the corresponding model name into a vector of tuples. Finally, the function returns the vector.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\"])  # Sample data frame for demonstration\nmodels_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln.(models_counts)\n```\nThe output will be something like:\n`\"A\" => 1`, `\"B\" => 1`, `\"C\" => 1`, `\"D\" => 1`, `\"E\" => 1`, `\"F\" => 1\"`","status":200,"tokens":[0,349],"elapsed":2.784169524,"_type":"aimessage"}]
