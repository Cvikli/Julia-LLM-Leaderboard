The results are collected into a Vector of Integers, where each element is the count of rows for one model. The order of elements in this Vector corresponds to the order of models in the original DataFrame. \n\nFor example, if you call `count_model_rows(df_cars)`, it will return `[2, 1, 1]`. This means that there are two rows with model `\"a4\"`, one row with model `\"a6\"` and one row with model `\"q7\"`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,250],"elapsed":2.008643919,"_type":"aimessage"}]
