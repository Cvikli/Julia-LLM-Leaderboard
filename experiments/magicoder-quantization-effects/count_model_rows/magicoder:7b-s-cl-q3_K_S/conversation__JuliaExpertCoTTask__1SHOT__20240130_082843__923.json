Here is a simple way to implement your task:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, CategoricalArrays\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    count = nrow.(grouped)\n    merge(count, grouped[1])\nend\n```\n\nThis function groups the dataframe by `model` and counts the number of rows in each group. It then merges this count with the original dataframe so that you get a table where the model is on the left side and it's respective row count is on the right side. \n\nFor example, if you run:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThe output will be:\n|model | count_model_rows   |\n|------|--------------------|\n| a4   | 3                  |\n| a6   | 1                  |\n| q7   | 1                  |","status":200,"tokens":[0,266],"elapsed":2.13703621,"_type":"aimessage"}]
