This groups rows that have the same values in the `:model` column together. Then we use the `combine` function to calculate the number of rows for each group (i.e., model).\n\nWhen you run this function with your example data, it will return a new DataFrame where each row represents a unique value in the `:model` column and its corresponding count:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n\n# Output:\n#  model  x\n# 1    a4  3\n# 2    a6  1\n# 3    q7  1\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,261],"elapsed":4.535661442,"_type":"aimessage"}]
