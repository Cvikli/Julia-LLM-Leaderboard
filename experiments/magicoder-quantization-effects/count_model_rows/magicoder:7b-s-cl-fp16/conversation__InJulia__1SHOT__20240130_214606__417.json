Here's an example:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = nrow.(grouped)\n    return counts\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", \"A\", \"B\", \"C\"], other=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9])\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nIn this example, the `groupby` function groups the DataFrame by the `model` column. The `nrow` function is then applied to each group, which counts how many rows are in that group. The results are returned as a Vector of integers.","status":200,"tokens":[0,224],"elapsed":3.854473563,"_type":"aimessage"}]
