Here is an example:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef count_model_rows(df):\n    return df.groupby('model').size()\n\n# Assuming `df_cars` is your DataFrame and it has a column named 'model'\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThis will give you a Series where the index are unique values in 'model' column and corresponding values are number of rows for each model. You can convert this to a DataFrame if you want:\n\n```python\ncounts_df = counts.reset_index()\ncounts_df.columns = ['model', 'count']\n```\n\nNow `counts_df` is a DataFrame where the first column ('model') contains unique values from the original 'model' column and the second column ('count') contains the number of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,240],"elapsed":4.158568381,"_type":"aimessage"}]
