The results are stored in a new column called \"x1\". Finally, we iterate over the DataFrame and print out each model with its corresponding count.\n\nThis solution assumes that you have already added `DataFrames` package to your Julia environment by running `Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\")`.\nPlease note that this task assumes that your DataFrame has at least one row for each unique value in the 'model' column, if not it will result an error as 'nrow' function is applied on grouped DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,327],"elapsed":5.715239829,"_type":"aimessage"}]
