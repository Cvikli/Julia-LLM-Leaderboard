Then it uses the `combine` function along with a lambda expression to count the number of rows in each group. The result is a DataFrame with one row for each unique value in the 'model' column, and a 'counts' column giving the total number of rows in that group.","status":200,"tokens":[0,158],"elapsed":2.764800314,"_type":"aimessage"}]
