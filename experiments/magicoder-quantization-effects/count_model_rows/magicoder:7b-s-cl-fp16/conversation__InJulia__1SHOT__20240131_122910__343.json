Here is an example:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, CategoricalArrays\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    return nrow.(grouped)\nend\n```\nIn the above function, `groupby` groups the data by the `:model` column. Then, `nrow` is applied to each group which returns the number of rows in that group. The result is a Vector of integers where the i-th integer represents the number of rows in the i-th group.\n\nPlease note that you need to have DataFrames.jl package installed in your Julia environment. If it's not, install it by running `]add DataFrames` in the Julia REPL or add it to your `Project.toml` file.","status":200,"tokens":[0,203],"elapsed":3.499927656,"_type":"aimessage"}]
