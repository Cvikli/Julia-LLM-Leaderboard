Here is an example:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = combine(grouped, nrow => :counts)\nend\n```\nIn this function, `groupby` groups the dataframe by the 'model' column. Then, `combine` is used to calculate the number of rows in each group and assign it a new column named 'counts'. The result is a new DataFrame where each row represents a unique model and its corresponding count of rows.","status":200,"tokens":[0,174],"elapsed":2.995777488,"_type":"aimessage"}]
