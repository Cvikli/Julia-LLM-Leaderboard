The result is a new DataFrame where the index is the unique values from the `model` column and the value in each row is the count of how many times that model appears in the original DataFrame.\n\nTo use this function, you would call it like this:\n```julia\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,180],"elapsed":3.113355043,"_type":"aimessage"}]
