Then `combine` is used to calculate the number of rows (`nrow`) for each group and store it in a new column called 'count'. The result is a new DataFrame where each row represents a unique model and its corresponding count of rows.\n\nHere is an example usage:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", \"G\"], other=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7])\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThis will give you a DataFrame where each row represents a unique model and the number of rows with that model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,264],"elapsed":4.55215889,"_type":"aimessage"}]
