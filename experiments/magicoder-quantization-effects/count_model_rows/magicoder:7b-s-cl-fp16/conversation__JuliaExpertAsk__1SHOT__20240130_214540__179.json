The result is a new DataFrame where the index is the unique models and the column contains the count of rows for that model. \n\nYou can use it like this:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"A\", \"B\"]) # example data frame\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will give you a new DataFrame where the index is the unique models and the column contains the count of rows for that model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,223],"elapsed":3.84349856,"_type":"aimessage"}]
