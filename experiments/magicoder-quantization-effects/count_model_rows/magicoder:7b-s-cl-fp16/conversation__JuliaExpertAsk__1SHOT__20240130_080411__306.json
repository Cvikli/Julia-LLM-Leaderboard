If you don't want it to be modified, consider using a deepcopy of the DataFrame before applying the function. \n\nAdditional dependencies:\nTo install these packages in Julia, run `] add DataFrames CategoricalArrays` command in your Julia REPL or use Pkg.add() function in your script.","status":200,"tokens":[0,275],"elapsed":4.78567287,"_type":"aimessage"}]
