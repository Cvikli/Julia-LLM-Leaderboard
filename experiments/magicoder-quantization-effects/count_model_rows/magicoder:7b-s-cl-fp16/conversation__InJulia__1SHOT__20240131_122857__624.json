Then it applies a transformation that calculates the number of rows in each group (the size of each group). The result is returned as a new DataFrame with columns for each model and a single column containing the count of rows for each model.\n\nPlease note: You need to have the DataFrames package installed, you can do this by running `Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\")` in your Julia console/REPL.","status":200,"tokens":[0,192],"elapsed":3.318504004,"_type":"aimessage"}]
