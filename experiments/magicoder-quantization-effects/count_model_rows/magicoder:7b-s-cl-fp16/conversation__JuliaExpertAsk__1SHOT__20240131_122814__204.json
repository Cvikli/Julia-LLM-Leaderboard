The `size(x)[1]` is used to get the length/number of rows of each grouped DataFrame.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\"], other_column=[1,2,3,4,5,6])  # example DataFrame\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,235],"elapsed":4.072852988,"_type":"aimessage"}]
