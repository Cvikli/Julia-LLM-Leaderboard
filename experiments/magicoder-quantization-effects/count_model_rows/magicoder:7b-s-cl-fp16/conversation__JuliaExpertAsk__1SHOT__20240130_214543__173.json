The result is combined into a new DataFrame where each row represents one unique model and its count.\n\nTo use this function with your DataFrame `df_cars`, you would call it like this:\n```julia\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,193],"elapsed":3.325925922,"_type":"aimessage"}]
