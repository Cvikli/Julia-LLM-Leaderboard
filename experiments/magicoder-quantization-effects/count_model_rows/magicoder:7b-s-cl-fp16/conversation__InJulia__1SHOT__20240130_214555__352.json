Here is an example:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = combine(grouped, nrow => identity)\n    return counts\nend\n```\nThis function will return a new DataFrame where the rows are grouped by `model` and each row contains the count of rows for that model. The `combine` function is used to apply an operation (in this case counting the number of rows) on each group. \n\nYou can use it like so:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"A\", \"B\"], other=[1,2,3,4,5]) # example dataframe\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,242],"elapsed":4.171858235,"_type":"aimessage"}]
