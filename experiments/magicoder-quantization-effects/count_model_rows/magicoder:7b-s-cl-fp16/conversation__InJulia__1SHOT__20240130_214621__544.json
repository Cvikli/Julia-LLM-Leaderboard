Here's an example:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = nrow.(grouped)\n    return counts\nend\n```\nThis function takes a DataFrame as input and returns an array of integers where each integer represents the number of rows in a group for that model.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"A\", \"B\"], other_column=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln.(counts)\n```\nThis will print the number of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,233],"elapsed":4.012800939,"_type":"aimessage"}]
