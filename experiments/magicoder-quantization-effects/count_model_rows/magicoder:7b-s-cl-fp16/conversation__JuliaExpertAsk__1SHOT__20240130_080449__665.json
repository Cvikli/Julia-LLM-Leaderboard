The package DataFrames provides efficient solutions for such tasks. Here is an example of how you might define the function `count_model_rows`:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    # Group data by column 'model' and calculate size of each group \n    return nrow.(groupby(df, :model)) |> collect\nend\n```\nIn this function, `groupby(df, :model)` groups the DataFrame `df` by the column `'model'` and returns a GroupedDataFrame. The `nrow` function calculates the number of rows in each group. By using `collect`, we convert the resultant GroupedArray into a Vector of integers.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\n# create some sample data\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"Ford\", \"Chevy\", \"Ford\", \"BMW\", \"Chevy\", \"BMW\"],\n                    year=[2018, 2019, 2020, 2017, 2018, 2020])\n\n# apply the function to the data and print the result\nprintln(count_model_rows(df_cars))\n```\nThis will output: `[2, 2, 1]` which indicates that there are 2 rows for 'Ford' model, 2 rows for 'Chevy' model, and 1 row for 'BMW' model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,350],"elapsed":6.118534851,"_type":"aimessage"}]
