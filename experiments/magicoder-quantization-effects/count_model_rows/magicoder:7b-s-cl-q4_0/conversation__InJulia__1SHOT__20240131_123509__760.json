Here's an example of how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = combine(grouped, nrow => first => \"count\")\nend\n```\n\nIn the function `count_model_rows`, we use the `groupby` function to divide our DataFrame into groups based on the 'model' column. Then we use the `combine` function to calculate how many rows there are for each group (i.e., for each model). The result is a new DataFrame where each row represents a unique model and its corresponding count of rows. \n\nYou can call this function with your DataFrame as follows:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"A\", \"B\"], other_column=[1,2,3,4,5]) # example data\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will return a new DataFrame where each row represents a unique model and the corresponding count of rows.","status":200,"tokens":[0,271],"elapsed":2.041607894,"_type":"aimessage"}]
