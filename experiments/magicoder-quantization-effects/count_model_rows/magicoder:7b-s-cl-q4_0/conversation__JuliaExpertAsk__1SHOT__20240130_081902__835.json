The count() function is used to get the frequency of occurrence of each unique element in a series. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef count_model_rows(df_cars):\n    counts = (df_cars['model'].value_counts())\n    return dict(counts)\n\n# Example usage:\ndata = {'model': ['A', 'B', 'A', 'C', 'B']}  # create sample data frame\ndf_cars = pd.DataFrame(data)\nprint(count_model_rows(df_cars))  # prints the count of each model\n```\nThis will print a dictionary where keys are different models and values are their counts.","status":200,"tokens":[0,184],"elapsed":1.382581242,"_type":"aimessage"}]
