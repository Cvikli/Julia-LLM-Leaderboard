Then, we iterate over this dictionary with a for loop, printing each model and its corresponding count.\n\nThis function assumes that df_cars is a DataFrame containing column `:model`. If the name or format of your DataFrame/column differs, you'll need to adjust the code accordingly. \n\nRemember to install the necessary package with Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\") and Counter.jl before running this function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,258],"elapsed":1.933972707,"_type":"aimessage"}]
