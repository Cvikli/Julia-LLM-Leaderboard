The results are combined into a new DataFrame with a column \"count\" that holds the sum of these counts.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"A\", \"C\", \"B\"])\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will return a new DataFrame with columns `model` and `count`, where the counts represent how many rows there are for each model in the original DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,239],"elapsed":1.75935186,"_type":"aimessage"}]
