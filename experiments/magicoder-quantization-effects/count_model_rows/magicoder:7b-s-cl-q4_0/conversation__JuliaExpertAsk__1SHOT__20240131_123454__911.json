The function `count_model_rows` takes in a DataFrame and a column name as arguments, groups the data by that column (in our case `:model`), and calculates how many rows there are for each group. \n\nThe result of this function is another DataFrame where each row represents a unique value in the `model` column and its corresponding total number of rows in the original DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,254],"elapsed":1.910392447,"_type":"aimessage"}]
