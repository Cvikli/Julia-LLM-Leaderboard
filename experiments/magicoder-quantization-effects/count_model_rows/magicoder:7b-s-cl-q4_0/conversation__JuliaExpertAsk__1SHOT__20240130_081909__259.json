Here is an example:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, DataFramesMeta\n\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"A\", \"B\"])  # dummy data\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    df |> @groupby(:model) |> @summarize(rowcount=. counts)\nend\n```\nIn this function, `@groupby` operation groups the DataFrame by the column `:model`. Then, `@summarize` calculates a new column `rowcount` which is equal to the number of rows in each group (i.e., for each model). The `.` symbol means that all columns will be included in the output.\n\nYou can call this function with your DataFrame as follows:\n\n```julia\ndf_result = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nAfter calling `count_model_rows` function, df_result would have a new column `rowcount` that represents the number of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,263],"elapsed":1.969620683,"_type":"aimessage"}]
