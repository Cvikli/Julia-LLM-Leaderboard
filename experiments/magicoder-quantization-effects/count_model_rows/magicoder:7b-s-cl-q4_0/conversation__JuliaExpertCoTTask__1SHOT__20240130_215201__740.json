Here is how you would write this function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return nrow.(groupby(df, :model))\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a dataframe as input and returns an array of integers. Each integer is the number of rows in each group of data that share the same value for the `model` column. \n\nYou can use it on your example like this:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThis will return an array with one element for each unique value in the `model` column, where the i-th element is the number of rows in the group that has the same value as the i-th unique model. For example, if we print this result, it would look like: `[2, 1, 2]`. This means there are 2 rows for 'a4' and 1 row for 'a6', and 2 rows for 'q7'.","status":200,"tokens":[0,283],"elapsed":2.102429431,"_type":"aimessage"}]
