Then it uses the `combine` function from the `DataFramesMeta` package (which is included in `DataFrames`) to calculate the number of rows for each group, and returns a new DataFrame with the counts.\n\nMake sure you've added the necessary packages using Pkg.add(\"PackageName\") before running this code. The CategoricalArrays package is used here because it allows the groupby operation on non-String columns as well. If your \"model\" column contains non-String values, remove or replace CategoricalArrays with appropriate handling for those types of data.\n\nRemember to run `using DataFrames` and `using CategoricalArrays` at the top of your script before you use these functions.","status":200,"tokens":[90,260],"elapsed":1.988816948,"_type":"aimessage"}]
