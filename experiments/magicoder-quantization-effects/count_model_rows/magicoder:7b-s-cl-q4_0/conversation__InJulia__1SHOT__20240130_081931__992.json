Here's a simple solution using it:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\n# Assuming df_cars is your DataFrame and 'model' is one of its column names.\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    # Group by model and use the function `.= length` to count how many rows there are for each group.\n    return by(df_cars, :model => _ -> length(_), rename = x -> \"Count\") \nend\n```\nIn this function `count_model_rows`, we are using the `by` function from DataFrames package which groups the data by 'model' and calculates the length of each group. The result is a new DataFrame where each unique 'model' entry has its corresponding count in another column labeled \"Count\".\n  \nPlease note that you should replace `:model => _ -> length(_)` with your actual operation if needed. For example, if you want to perform some calculations on the rows within each group instead of just counting them, you can use `sum` or any other function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,253],"elapsed":1.899427772,"_type":"aimessage"}]
