Then we calculate the sizes for each group, store it in an array, and return that array.\n\nFor example, if you run this on a DataFrame df_cars:\n\n```julia\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nYou'll get an array where each row is the number of rows for that model in your original data frame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,245],"elapsed":1.833970697,"_type":"aimessage"}]
