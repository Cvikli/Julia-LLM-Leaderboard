The result is a new DataFrame where each row represents one unique model, and it has two columns: \"model\" (the name of the model) and \"count\" (the number of rows for that model).\n\nPlease note that you need to have `DataFrames` and `CategoricalArrays` packages installed in your Julia environment. If they are not installed yet, you can add them using Pkg:\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"DataFrames\")\nPkg.add(\"CategoricalArrays\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,247],"elapsed":1.818310021,"_type":"aimessage"}]
