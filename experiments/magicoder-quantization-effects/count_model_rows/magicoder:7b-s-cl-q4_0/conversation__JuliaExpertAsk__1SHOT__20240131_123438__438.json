The `nrow.` function is then used to calculate how many rows there are for each group. This function returns an array of integers, where the i-th integer represents the number of rows in the i-th group.\n\nHere's a usage example:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"A\", \"C\", \"B\"]) # sample data frame\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will return `[2, 2, 1]`, indicating that there are 2 rows for the model \"A\", 2 rows for the model \"B\" and 1 row for the model \"C\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,246],"elapsed":1.87269005,"_type":"aimessage"}]
