This returns a grouped collection of rows for each model.\n    grouped = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n    \n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store counts for each model\n    counts = Dict()\n    \n    # Iterate over each group (i.e., each model).\n    for group in grouped\n        # Use Counter to calculate the count of rows within each group/model.\n        counts[string(group[1, :model])] = length(group)\n    end\n    \n    return counts\nend\n```\nThis function `count_model_rows` will return a dictionary where keys are model names and values are corresponding row counts in the DataFrame. \n\nPlease note that you need to have the DataFrames package installed for this code to work. You can install it using the Pkg REPL-mode:\n```julia\n]add DataFrames\n```","status":200,"tokens":[59,278],"elapsed":2.105837512,"_type":"aimessage"}]
