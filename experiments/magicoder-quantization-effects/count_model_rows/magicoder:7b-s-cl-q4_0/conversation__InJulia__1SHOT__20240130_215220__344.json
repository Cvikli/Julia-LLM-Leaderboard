Then, for each of these groups, we calculate the number of rows using the `nrow` function and store it in a new column called `:count`. The result is a new DataFrame where each row represents a unique model from the original DataFrame, and the value in the `:count` column is the number of rows for that model.\n\nNote: If you want to get the counts as a dictionary mapping models to their counts, you can modify the function like this:\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    return Dict(name => nrow(group) for (name, group) in zip(unique(df.model), grouped))\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[59,271],"elapsed":2.011671882,"_type":"aimessage"}]
