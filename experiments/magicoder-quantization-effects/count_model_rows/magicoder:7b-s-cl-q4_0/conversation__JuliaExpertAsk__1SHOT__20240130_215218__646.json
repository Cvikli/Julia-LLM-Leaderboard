The `map` function then applies a function that calculates the length of each group. If there are missing values in the model column, they will be replaced with \"Unknown\" before counting. \n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"A\", \"B\", missing])\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will return a CategoricalArray with counts for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,232],"elapsed":1.706361942,"_type":"aimessage"}]
