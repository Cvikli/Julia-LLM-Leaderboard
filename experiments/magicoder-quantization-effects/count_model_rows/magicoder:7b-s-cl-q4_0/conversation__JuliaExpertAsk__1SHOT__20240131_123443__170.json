It then calculates the number of rows in each group (i.e., for each unique model) and stores this count in a new column called `count`. Finally, it renames the `nrow` column to `count` before returning the result.\n\nNote that if you're using an older version of DataFrames.jl without `@transform`, you can achieve the same thing with:\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    df_count = groupby(df_cars, :model) |> \n              combine(:nrow => sum => :count)\n    return df_count\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,285],"elapsed":2.157589017,"_type":"aimessage"}]
