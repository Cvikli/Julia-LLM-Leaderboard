The `transform!` function is then used to add an additional column `:n` which contains the number of rows in each group (i.e., for each model).\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"A\", \"C\", \"B\"])\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nIn this case, the result `counts` will be a new DataFrame with columns `:model` and `:n`. The number of rows for each model is calculated as shown in your request.","status":200,"tokens":[0,231],"elapsed":1.729115062,"_type":"aimessage"}]
