The `combine` function then calculates how many rows there are for each group (i.e., model), and the `mean` function computes the average count, which is just the number of rows for that particular model in this case. The result is a DataFrame where each row corresponds to a different model and its count of rows.","status":200,"tokens":[90,333],"elapsed":2.537038814,"_type":"aimessage"}]
