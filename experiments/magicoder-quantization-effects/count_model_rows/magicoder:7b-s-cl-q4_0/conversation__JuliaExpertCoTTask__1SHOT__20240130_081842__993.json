It uses the built-in `groupby` function to group rows by the column `:model`. The size of each group (the number of rows in that group) is then calculated using the `size` function and added into an array. This array is returned by the function.\n\nWhen you run this code with your given DataFrame, it will output `[2, 1, 2]`, indicating there are 2 cars of type \"a4\", 1 car of type \"a6\", and 2 cars of type \"q7\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,273],"elapsed":2.092228274,"_type":"aimessage"}]
