Then we apply `combine` function which calculates length of each group. The result is a new DataFrame where each row contains the count of rows for a particular model. \n\nPlease make sure you have the DataFrames.jl package installed in your Julia environment. If it's not installed, use the following command to add it: `]add DataFrames`.","status":200,"tokens":[244,223],"elapsed":3.110779487,"_type":"aimessage"}]
