Then it calculates the number of rows for each group using the `nrow` function and returns these counts as an array. \n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"A\", \"B\"])\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln.(counts)\n```\n\nThis will print the number of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,201],"elapsed":1.901529043,"_type":"aimessage"}]
