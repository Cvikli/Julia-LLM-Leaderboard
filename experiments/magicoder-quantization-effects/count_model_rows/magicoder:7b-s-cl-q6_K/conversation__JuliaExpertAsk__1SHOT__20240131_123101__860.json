Then it uses the `combine` function to calculate the number of rows in each group (i.e., for each unique model). The result is a new DataFrame where each row represents one unique model, and the `count` column contains the number of rows for that model.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", \"A\", \"B\", \"C\"])\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[90,232],"elapsed":2.238891888,"_type":"aimessage"}]
