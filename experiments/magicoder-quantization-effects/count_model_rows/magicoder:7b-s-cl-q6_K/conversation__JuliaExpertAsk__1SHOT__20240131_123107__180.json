Then it calculates how many rows there are for each group using the `nrow` function that is specific to grouped data in this package. The result is returned as a vector of integers. \n\nFor example, if you have a DataFrame like this:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", \"G\", \"H\", \"I\"],\n                    other=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])\n```\nAnd you call `count_model_rows(df_cars)`, it will return `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. This means that each model appears once in the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,273],"elapsed":2.606308057,"_type":"aimessage"}]
