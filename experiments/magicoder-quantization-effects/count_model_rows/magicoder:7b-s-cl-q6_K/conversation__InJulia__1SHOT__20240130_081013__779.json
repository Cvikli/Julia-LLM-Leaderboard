Here is an example:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"A\", \"B\", \"C\"]) # Sample DataFrame\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped_by_model = groupby(df, :model)\n    \n    model_counts = map(collect(eachrow(grouped_by_model))) do row\n        (model=row.model, count=size(row)...)[2]\n    end\n\n    return DataFrame(model_counts)\nend\n\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nIn the above function `count_model_rows`, we first create a grouped dataframe by 'model' using `groupby`. Then, for each row in this grouped dataframe, we calculate its size which gives us the number of rows it contains. \n\nThe result is a new DataFrame with each unique model and its count. Please replace the sample data `df_cars` with your own dataset.","status":200,"tokens":[0,252],"elapsed":2.418945382,"_type":"aimessage"}]
