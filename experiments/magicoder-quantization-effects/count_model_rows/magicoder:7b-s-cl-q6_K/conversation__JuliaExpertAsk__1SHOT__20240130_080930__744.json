Here is an example:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    return nrow.(grouped)\nend\n```\nIn this function `groupby` groups the dataframe by the 'model' column. Then `nrow` is called on each group which gives the number of rows in that group. These are then returned as a vector. \n\nThis function can be used like so:\n\n```julia\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThen counts will hold the number of rows for each model in df_cars.","status":200,"tokens":[90,183],"elapsed":1.785620593,"_type":"aimessage"}]
