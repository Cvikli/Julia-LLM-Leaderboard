Then it uses `combine` with a lambda function that calculates the length of each group (i.e., the number of rows in each group). The result is a new DataFrame where each row represents one unique model and its count of rows.\n\nYou can call this function like so:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], other=[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12])\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will return a DataFrame where the first column is 'model' and the second column is 'counts', representing how many rows there are for each model in `df_cars`.","status":200,"tokens":[90,284],"elapsed":2.716820746,"_type":"aimessage"}]
