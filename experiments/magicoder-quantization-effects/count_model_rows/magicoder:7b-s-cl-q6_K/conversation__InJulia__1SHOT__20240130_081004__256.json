Here's an example of how you could do this in Julia using the DataFrames library:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    map(x -> nrow(first(x)), grouped)\nend\n\n# Now if you want to apply this function on df_cars:\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis `count_model_rows` function groups the dataframe by model, and then for each group it returns the number of rows in that group. The `nrow` function is used to calculate this.\n\nPlease note that your data frame must contain a column named \"model\" for this code snippet to work as expected. If you have another name for this column, replace :model with the actual column's name.","status":200,"tokens":[0,198],"elapsed":1.902622054,"_type":"aimessage"}]
