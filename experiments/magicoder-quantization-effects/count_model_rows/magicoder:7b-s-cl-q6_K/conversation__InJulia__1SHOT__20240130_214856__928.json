Then, we use the `combine` function to calculate the number of rows for each model (`nrow` is a built-in function that returns the number of rows in a group). The result is a new DataFrame where each row represents a unique model and its count.\n\nYou can call this function with your DataFrame as follows:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\"], other=[1,2,3,4,5,6]) # example DataFrame\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will give you a new DataFrame `counts` where each row represents a unique model and its count.","status":200,"tokens":[0,262],"elapsed":2.477628707,"_type":"aimessage"}]
