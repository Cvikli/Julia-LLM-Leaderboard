Then it uses the `combine` function to calculate the number of rows in each group (which is equivalent to counting the number of rows for each model). The result is a new DataFrame where each row represents one unique model, and there's a column named \"count\" that indicates how many rows are associated with that model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,167],"elapsed":1.589743055,"_type":"aimessage"}]
