The `combine` function then calculates the number of rows for each group. The result is a new DataFrame with one row per unique value in the 'model' column and a new column called 'count' that contains the number of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,155],"elapsed":1.461712666,"_type":"aimessage"}]
