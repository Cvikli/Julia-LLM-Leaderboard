The result is a new dataframe where each row represents a unique model, and it has a column \"count\" which indicates how many rows there were for that model.\n\nPlease note that you need to have DataFrames.jl package installed in your Julia environment. If not installed, use following command: `]add DataFrames`","status":200,"tokens":[0,229],"elapsed":2.180116408,"_type":"aimessage"}]
