Here's an example of how you can solve this problem using it:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = nrow.(grouped)\n    return counts\nend\n```\n\nThis function groups the data frame by `model` and then calculates the number of rows in each group. The result is a vector where each element corresponds to the count of rows for one unique model. \n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", \"E\", \"F\", \"G\"], other_column=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) # example data frame\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln.(zip(unique(df_cars.model), counts))\n```\nThis will print the model and its count of rows in the console.","status":200,"tokens":[0,262],"elapsed":2.492461421,"_type":"aimessage"}]
