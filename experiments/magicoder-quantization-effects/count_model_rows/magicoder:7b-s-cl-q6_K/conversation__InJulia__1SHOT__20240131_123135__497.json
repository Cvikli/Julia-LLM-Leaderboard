The result is a Vector of integers where the index corresponds to the model name and the value at that index is the count of rows for that model.\n\nPlease note, you need to import DataFrames package before running this function. You can do it by adding `using DataFrames` in your code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,188],"elapsed":1.787057237,"_type":"aimessage"}]
