Here is a possible solution:\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    \n    result = DataFrame()\n    \n    for (group, subdf) in grouped\n        row = [group => sizehint!(similar(collect(subdf[!, 1]), 0), length(subdf)) for _ in 1:nrow(grouped)]\n        \n        push!(result, row)\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\nThis function first groups the DataFrame by 'model' and then goes through each group. For each group, it creates a new row with the count of rows in that group and appends this to `result`. The resulting DataFrame contains the unique models from the original DataFrame and their counts as separate columns.","status":200,"tokens":[0,222],"elapsed":1.793951808,"_type":"aimessage"}]
