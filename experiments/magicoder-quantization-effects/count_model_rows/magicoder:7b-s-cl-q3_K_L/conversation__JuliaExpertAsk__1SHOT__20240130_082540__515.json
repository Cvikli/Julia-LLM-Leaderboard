Here is a solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    grouped = groupby(df_cars, :model) # grouping by model\n    return count(grouped) # counting rows for each group\nend\n```\nIn this function `groupby` is used to group the data by 'model'. The `count` function then counts the number of rows in each group. This function should return a DataFrame where the first column contains the unique values from the 'model' column and the second column contains corresponding count of rows for that model.\n\nNote: Please make sure you have imported the relevant packages before using these functions. The `groupby` function is part of the \"DataFrames\" package, while `count` is a standalone function from DataFrameMeta package.","status":200,"tokens":[0,194],"elapsed":1.553117883,"_type":"aimessage"}]
