The result is a Vector of Int64 where the i-th element represents the count of rows for the i-th model. Then it iterates over unique models (which are assumed to be categorical) along with their counts, printing out each one.","status":200,"tokens":[0,248],"elapsed":1.993340015,"_type":"aimessage"}]
