Then, we use the `combine` function to calculate for each group the number of rows, and store it in a new DataFrame under a new column called \"count\". \n\nHere is how you can call this function:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"Ford\", \"BMW\", \"Audi\", \"Fiat\", \"BMW\"])\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nshow(counts, allcols=Symbol[:model :count])\n```\nThis will display the counts of each model in `df_cars`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,227],"elapsed":1.806723691,"_type":"aimessage"}]
