The `groupby` function returns a grouped object which can be used to calculate summary statistics. The `combine` function calculates the number of rows in each group and returns these as a new DataFrame.\n\nYou can then call this function with your DataFrame:\n```julia\ndf_cars = CSV.read(\"path/to/your/file.csv\") # read from csv file\nmodel_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars) \n# model_counts will contain a new DataFrame where the rows are grouped by \"model\" and the second column is the count of rows for each group\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,329],"elapsed":2.941999639,"_type":"aimessage"}]
