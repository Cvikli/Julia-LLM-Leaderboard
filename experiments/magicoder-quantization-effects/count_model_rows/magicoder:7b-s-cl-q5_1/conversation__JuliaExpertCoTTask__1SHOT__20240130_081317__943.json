Then it groups the dataframe by this new string version of the `model` column and counts the number of rows in each group (which corresponds to each unique model). It returns these counts as a new dataframe.\n\nLet's try this function on your example:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThe output will be:\n```julia\n| model | count |\n|-------|-------|\n| a4    | 3     |\n| a6    | 1     |\n| q7    | 1     |\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,277],"elapsed":2.532006104,"_type":"aimessage"}]
