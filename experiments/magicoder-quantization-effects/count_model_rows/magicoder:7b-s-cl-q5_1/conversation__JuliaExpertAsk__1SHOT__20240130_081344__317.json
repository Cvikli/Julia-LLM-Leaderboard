The `groupby` function groups the DataFrame by 'model' column, while `combine(grouped, nrow)` calculates how many rows there are for each group (model).\n\nThen you can call this function with your DataFrame:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[randstring(3), randstring(4), randstring(3), randstring(4);], \n                    make=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\";], \n                    year=[2019, 2018, 2017, 2016;])\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThis will return a DataFrame with the number of rows for each model.\n\nPlease note that you need to install Pandas via `Pkg.add(\"Pandas\")` if it's not installed already and use `using Pandas` in your code before running this function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,329],"elapsed":3.011496662,"_type":"aimessage"}]
