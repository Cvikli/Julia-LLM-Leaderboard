Then `combine` is used to create a new column for the counts of rows. The function `sum` returns the sum of the nrow (number of observations per group), and then `=> sum => \"count\"` assigns this sum as a new column in the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,213],"elapsed":1.95823877,"_type":"aimessage"}]
