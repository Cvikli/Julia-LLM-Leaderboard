This creates a GroupedDataFrame, which is similar to a regular DataFrame but with its rows grouped by model. \n\nThe function then uses the `eachrow` function on this GroupedDataFrame, which returns an iterator over each row of the dataframe. The `nrow` function is called on these rows to count how many there are in each group.","status":200,"tokens":[0,185],"elapsed":2.084521692,"_type":"aimessage"}]
