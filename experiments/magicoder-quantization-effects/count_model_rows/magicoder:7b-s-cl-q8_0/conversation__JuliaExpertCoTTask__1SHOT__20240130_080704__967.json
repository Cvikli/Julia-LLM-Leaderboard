In this case, it's grouping by 'model'. The `combine` function then aggregates the results for each group by computing the length of each group (which is the number of rows in that group). This gives you a new data frame where each row represents a unique model and the count of how many times that model appears in the original data frame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,225],"elapsed":2.550035233,"_type":"aimessage"}]
