Inside the function, we use the groupby() function from DataFrames to group our data by the `:model` column. We then call nrow() on each of these grouped dataframes, which gives us the number of rows in each group.\n\nWe then create a sample dataframe `df_cars`, and call our function with this dataframe. The results are printed out.","status":200,"tokens":[0,313],"elapsed":3.531237051,"_type":"aimessage"}]
