However, similar operations can be performed with DataFrames package from Julia ecosystem which provides a high-performance and flexible toolset for data manipulation and analysis. Here's an example of how you might define this function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\n# Assume that df_cars is your dataframe\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    # Group by model column\n    grouped = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n    \n    # Calculate the number of rows in each group \n    counts = combine(grouped, nrow => \"count\")\nend\n```\nIn this function `groupby` is used to create a GroupBy object which groups the DataFrame based on a particular column. Then `combine` function is used to apply a function over each group. Here `nrow` gives the number of rows in each group and `\"count\"` is the name of the resulting column. \n\nNote: Before running this code, you need to install the required packages using Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\") or similar commands.","status":200,"tokens":[0,267],"elapsed":2.971171517,"_type":"aimessage"}]
