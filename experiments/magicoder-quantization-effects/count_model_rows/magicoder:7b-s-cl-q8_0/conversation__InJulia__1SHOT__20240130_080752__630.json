Then it returns a new DataFrame that contains the grouped data with count of rows for each group. \n\nTo use this function, you would first need to load your DataFrame into memory. Here's an example:\n```julia\n# Assuming df_cars is already defined and loaded in memory\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprint(counts)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,217],"elapsed":2.410712822,"_type":"aimessage"}]
