Here is an example of a function that counts the number of rows for each unique model in the DataFrame:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame) \n    grouped = groupby(df, :model) # Group by 'model' column\n    nrow.(grouped) # Returns an array of integers with number of rows in each group\nend\n```\nThis function will return a vector where the `i`-th element is the number of rows in the group with label `i`. \n\nTo test this function, you can create and run it on a DataFrame:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"Tesla\", \"Ford\", \"BMW\", \"Tesla\", \"Fiat\"], # Add more models if needed\n                    price=[3000, 2500, 3500, 4000, 1800])\n\nprintln.(count_model_rows(df_cars))\n```\nThis will output: `[2, 1, 1]` which corresponds to the fact that there are 2 Tesla's in the DataFrame, and one Ford and one BMW.","status":200,"tokens":[0,290],"elapsed":3.243302023,"_type":"aimessage"}]
