The `groupby` function from the DataFrames package groups the DataFrame by `:model`, meaning it will group together all the rows that have the same value in the `:model` column. The `nrow` function then counts the number of rows in each group. \n\nYou would use this function like so:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\"],\n                   other_column=[1,2,3,4,5,6])\n\nprintln.(count_model_rows(df_cars))\n```\nThis would output: `[1 1 1 1 1 1]`, indicating that each model (A, B, C, D, E, F) is represented by a single row in the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,292],"elapsed":2.508208796,"_type":"aimessage"}]
