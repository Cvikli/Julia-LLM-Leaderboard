Here is an example of how you could implement it:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\"])\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped_data = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = map(length, grouped_data.groups)\n    return counts\nend\n\nprintln(count_model_rows(df_cars))\n```\n\nIn this code, we first import the DataFrames package. We then define a function `count_model_rows` that takes a DataFrame as an input and returns an array of counts for each unique value in the column \"model\". Inside the function, we use the `groupby` function to group data by model and store the resulting grouped data object in the variable `grouped_data`. We then call the `map` function on `length`, passing it `grouped_data.groups` as an argument. This returns a new DataFrame with one row for each unique value in the column \"model\", where the values are the counts of rows corresponding to that model. Finally, we print these counts.","status":200,"tokens":[0,275],"elapsed":2.384884583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
