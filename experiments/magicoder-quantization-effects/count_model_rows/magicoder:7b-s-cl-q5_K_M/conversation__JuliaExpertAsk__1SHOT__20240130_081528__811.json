The `groupby` function groups the DataFrame by the 'model' column, and `combine` applies a function (in this case `length`) on each group resulting in a new DataFrame with a count for every unique value in the 'model' column.","status":200,"tokens":[0,160],"elapsed":1.398718738,"_type":"aimessage"}]
