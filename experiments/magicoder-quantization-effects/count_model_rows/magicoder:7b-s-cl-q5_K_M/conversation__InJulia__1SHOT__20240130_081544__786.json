Here `:model` is the column we are grouping by.\n- `nrow` is a built-in function in Pandas.jl which returns the number of rows for each group in grouped object. \n\nYou should note that this code might not work if you don't have the Pandas.jl library installed, as it depends on DataFrames and Panda. If your Julia installation doesn't have those packages installed, you can add them using Package Manager by running `]add DataFrames Pandas`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,303],"elapsed":2.575880985,"_type":"aimessage"}]
