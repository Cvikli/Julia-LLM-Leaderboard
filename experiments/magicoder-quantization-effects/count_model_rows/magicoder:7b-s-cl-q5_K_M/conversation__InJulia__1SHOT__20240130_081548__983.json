It uses the `groupby` function to group the DataFrame by the column \"model\". The `combine` function is then used on the grouped data to calculate the length of each group (i.e., number of rows for each model), which is then returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,223],"elapsed":1.910645702,"_type":"aimessage"}]
