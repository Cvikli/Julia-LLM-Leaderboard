Then, for each group (each unique model in this case), we calculate the number of rows using `nrow`. Finally, we print out the count for each model.\n\nNow you can call this function with your dataframe:\n```julia\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will output:\n```\nModel: a4 - Rows: 3\nModel: a6 - Rows: 1\nModel: q7 - Rows: 1\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,234],"elapsed":2.072033974,"_type":"aimessage"}]
