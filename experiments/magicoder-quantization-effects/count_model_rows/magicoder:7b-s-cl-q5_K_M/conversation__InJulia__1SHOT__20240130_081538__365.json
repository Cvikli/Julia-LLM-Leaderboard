It then uses the `groupby` and `combine` functions from the DataFrames package to group the data by the model column and calculate the number of rows (`nrow`) for each model. The results are returned as a new dataframe with models as the first column and counts as the second column.\n\nExample usage: \n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(model=[\"Toyota\" \"Honda\" \"Ford\" \"Toyota\"], \n               price=[1234, 2345, 3456, 1234])\n\ncount_model_rows(df)\n```\nThis will return a dataframe with two columns: `model` and `n`. The `model` column contains the unique model names from your original DataFrame, and the `n` column contains the count of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[59,362],"elapsed":3.130931791,"_type":"aimessage"}]
