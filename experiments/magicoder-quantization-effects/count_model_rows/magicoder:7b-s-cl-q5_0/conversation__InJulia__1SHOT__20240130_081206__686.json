Here's an example solution:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n    counts = nrow.(grouped)\n    return counts\nend\n```\n\nIn this function:\n- `groupby` is a high-level DataFrames API function that groups the data by model. It returns an iterator where each element is a DataFrame containing only rows from one group.\n- `nrow` is another high-level DataFrames API function that gives the number of rows in a given DataFrame.\n- Finally, we use broadcasting (`.`) to apply the `nrow` function to every group and collect the results into an array (`counts`).","status":200,"tokens":[0,199],"elapsed":1.695370475,"_type":"aimessage"}]
