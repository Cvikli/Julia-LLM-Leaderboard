This can be done using `groupby` from `GroupedArrays.jl`:\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame) \n    grouped_df = groupby(df, :model)\n    return nrow.(grouped_df)\nend\n```\nThis function takes a DataFrame as input and returns an array of integers where each value corresponds to the number of rows in each model's group. You can use it like this:\n```julia\ncount_rows = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThe `groupby` function groups together all rows that have the same values for a particular column (in our case, `:model`). The `nrow` function is then used to find out how many rows are in each group. \n\nPlease make sure your DataFrame has at least two columns named 'model'. This solution assumes that you want to group by \"model\" as the column name seems to suggest.","status":200,"tokens":[0,274],"elapsed":2.361830504,"_type":"aimessage"}]
