Then it calculates the number of rows for each group using the `nrow` function. The results are returned as a dictionary where keys are unique model names and values - corresponding counts.\n\nLet's check this solution:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThe output will be a dictionary where each unique model is a key and the corresponding count of rows for this model is a value: `Dict(\"a4\"=>3, \"a6\"=>1, \"q7\"=>1)`. So, for example, there are 3 rows with \"a4\" models, 1 row with \"a6\" models and 1 row with \"q7\" models.","status":200,"tokens":[0,306],"elapsed":2.683777678,"_type":"aimessage"}]
