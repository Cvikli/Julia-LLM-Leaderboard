It groups rows that have the same values in certain columns and applies a function to each group, returning a new DataFrame with the results. \n\nHere is how you could implement the `count_model_rows` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    return nrow.(grouped)\nend\n\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nIn this code, `groupby` function groups the rows by `:model`, and `nrow.` calculates the number of rows in each group.\n\nThe returned counts will be a DataFrame with columns `:model` and `:n`. You can convert it to a plain array if you prefer:\n\n```julia\ncounts_array = [collect(first.(eachrow(counts))), collect(last.(eachrow(counts)))], :autoformat => true)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[244,257],"elapsed":4.079242912,"_type":"aimessage"}]
