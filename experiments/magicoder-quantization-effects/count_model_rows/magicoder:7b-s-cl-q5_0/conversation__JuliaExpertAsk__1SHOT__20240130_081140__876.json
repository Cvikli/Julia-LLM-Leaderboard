Here's an example of how you could define such a function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\n# Define function\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = nrow.(grouped)\n    return counts\nend\n\n# Create sample DataFrame for testing\ndata = [[\"Ford\", \"Mustang\", 2005], [\"Tesla\", \"Model S\", 2021], [\"Tesla\", \"Model Y\", 2021]]\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=first.(data), year=last.(data))\n\n# Call function and print results\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nfor (k, v) in zip(groupbykeys(df_cars, :model), counts)\n    println(\"$k: $v\")\nend\n```\n\nThis will group the DataFrame by the \"model\" column and return an array of integers where each integer represents the number of rows for that particular model. Note that this solution assumes your DataFrame has a single column named `model`. If you have multiple columns, you may need to adjust the function accordingly. \n\nThe `groupbykeys` function is used to extract the keys from each group in the grouped data. The `nrow` function returns the number of rows in each group. Finally, we print out each model and its count.","status":200,"tokens":[0,347],"elapsed":2.974837888,"_type":"aimessage"}]
