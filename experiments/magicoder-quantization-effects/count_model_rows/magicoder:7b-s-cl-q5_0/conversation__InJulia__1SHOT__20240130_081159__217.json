The count() function will be used to get the number of rows for each model. Here is an example:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\n# assuming df_cars has been loaded into memory\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = DataFrame(model = [], rowcounts = []) # initialize output dataframe\n    \n    for grp in grouped\n        push!(counts, (grp[1], count(grp)))  # add a new row to the counts data frame with model and its count\n    end\n    \n    return counts\nend\n```\nThis function creates an empty DataFrame `counts` to store the results. Then it goes through each group in `grouped`, which are rows of `df_cars` grouped by their 'model' column, calculates the number of rows for each group (using count()), and adds a new row to `counts`. The function finally returns the filled `counts` DataFrame.\n\nRemember that this function modifies the input DataFrame (`df`) in-place while grouping it by :model. If you want to avoid modifying the original DataFrame, consider passing a copy of it instead: `count_model_rows(copy(df))`.","status":200,"tokens":[59,330],"elapsed":2.861587554,"_type":"aimessage"}]
