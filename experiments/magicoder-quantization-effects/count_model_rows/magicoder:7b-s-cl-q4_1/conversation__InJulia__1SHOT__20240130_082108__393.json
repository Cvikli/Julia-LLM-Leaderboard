Inside this function, we call the groupby function to group our data by the `:model` column. Then, we use the `combine` function to calculate the number of rows for each model and return it.\n\nYou can then use this like so:\n```julia\nmodel_counts = count_model_rows(df)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,243],"elapsed":1.936558217,"_type":"aimessage"}]
