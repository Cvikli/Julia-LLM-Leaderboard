It assumes you have the DataFrames package installed. The code first creates a sample DataFrame, then defines the function `count_model_rows`, which uses the `groupby` function from DataFrames.jl to group the data by model and then computes the number of rows in each group:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, CategoricalArrays  # Required packages for this example\n\n# Create a sample DataFrame\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"BMW\", \"Audi\", \"BMW\", \"Mercedes-Benz\", \"Audi\"])\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame, col)\n    # Group by the column and use count() to compute how many rows are in each group\n    return groupby(df, :$(Symbol(col))).count\nend\n\n# Use the function on our sample DataFrame\nmodels = [\"BMW\", \"Audi\"]  # Models we're interested in\nfor model in models\n    println(\"Model: $model\")\n    rows = count_model_rows(df_cars, :model)\n    # Print number of rows for each model\n    for (k, v) in zip(collect(keys(rows)), collect(values(rows)))\n        if k == model\n            println(\"Number of $model cars: $v\")\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis will print out the number of BMW and Audi models in `df_cars`. If you want to count all models, not just a specific list, you can remove the loop over `models` and directly call `count_model_rows(df_cars, :model)`.","status":200,"tokens":[59,383],"elapsed":3.093863156,"_type":"aimessage"}]
