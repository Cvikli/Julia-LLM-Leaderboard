Here is a function that solves this task:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = map(x -> length(first(x)), grouped)\n    return counts\nend\n\n# Test the function with given data:\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThe `groupby` function groups rows in a dataframe by the values of one or more columns. The `map` function applies a function to each group and returns an array of results. In this case, we apply `length` function which counts the number of elements in a vector, and `first(x)` function is used to get the first element of each group (as we only need the count per model). This way, the resulting value is simply the total number of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,251],"elapsed":2.021490419,"_type":"aimessage"}]
