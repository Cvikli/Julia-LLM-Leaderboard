Here is an example of such function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, CategoricalArrays\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    # Convert model column to a categorical type for efficient grouping operation\n    df[:model] = CategoricalArray(df[:model])\n\n    grouped_data = groupby(df, :model)\n    \n    counts = nrow.(grouped_data)\n    \n    return counts\nend\n```\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\ncars = DataFrame(make=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"A\", \"B\"], model=[\"a1\", \"a2\", \"a3\", \"a4\", \"a5\"])\ncounts_by_model = count_model_rows(cars)\n```\nThis will return an array with the number of rows for each model in the DataFrame. For the example above, the result would be `[2, 1]` as there are two 'a1' and one 'a4' models.","status":200,"tokens":[0,252],"elapsed":2.012891723,"_type":"aimessage"}]
