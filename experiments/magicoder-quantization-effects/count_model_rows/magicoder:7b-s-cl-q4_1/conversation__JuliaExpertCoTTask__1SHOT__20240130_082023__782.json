We will use the `groupby` function from DataFrames and count the rows for each model.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = transform(grouped, n=:size)[:n]\n    return counts\nend\n```\nThis function first groups the DataFrame by model using `groupby`. It then uses `transform` to add a new column \"n\" containing the size of each group (i.e., the number of rows per model). Finally, it returns this new column.\n\nNow you can call your function with your DataFrame:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,213],"elapsed":1.735948149,"_type":"aimessage"}]
