Here's how you would write this function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Pandas\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = nrow.(grouped)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `groupby` function to split `df` into groups based on the values in the `model` column. It then calculates the number of rows in each group with the `nrow` function and returns this as a vector of integers. \n\nIf you want to get a DataFrame, you can modify it like:\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = nrow.(grouped)\n    return DataFrame(:model=>keys(grouped), :count=>counts)\nend\n```\n\nThen you will get a new DataFrame like:\n\n```julia\n| model | count |\n|-------|-------|\n|  \"a4\" |     3 |\n|  \"a6\" |     1 |\n| \"q7\"   |     1 |\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,281],"elapsed":2.27726903,"_type":"aimessage"}]
