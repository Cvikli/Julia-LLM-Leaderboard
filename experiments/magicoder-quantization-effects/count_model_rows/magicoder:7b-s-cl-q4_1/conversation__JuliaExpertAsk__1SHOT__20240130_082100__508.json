Please ensure that your DataFrame's column name for grouping is correct, as in this example it is `\"model\"`. If you are dealing with categorical variables and have to convert them first into CategoricalArrays before using groupby function, please make sure your Julia environment supports `CategoricalArrays` package.","status":200,"tokens":[0,406],"elapsed":3.260842329,"_type":"aimessage"}]
