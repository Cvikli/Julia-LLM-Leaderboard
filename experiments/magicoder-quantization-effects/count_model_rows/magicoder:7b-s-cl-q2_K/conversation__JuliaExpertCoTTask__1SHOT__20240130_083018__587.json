This example assumes that you have a DataFrame called df_cars with column 'model'.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped_data = groupby(df, :model)\n    \n    model_counts = combine(grouped_data, length, :model => \"count\" => length)\n    \n    return model_counts\nend\n```\n\nThis function first groups the data by the 'model' column and then combines each group to calculate how many rows there are for each unique value in the 'model' column. \nThe `groupby` function from DataFrames.jl is used to perform this grouping operation. The `combine` function calculates the desired count of rows for each model.\n\nTo run it, you can use:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThe function returns a new DataFrame that contains the counts for each unique model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,271],"elapsed":2.082721274,"_type":"aimessage"}]
