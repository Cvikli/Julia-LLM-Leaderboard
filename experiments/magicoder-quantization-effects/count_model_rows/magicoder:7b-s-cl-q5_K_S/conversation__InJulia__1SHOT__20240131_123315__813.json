You can do this via the Pkg REPL mode with the following command: `]add DataFrames`.\n\nHere is a sample code snippet that defines the function and then uses it on a DataFrame:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, CategoricalArrays\n\n# Define the DataFrame\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"Ford\", \"Toyota\", \"Honda\", \"Fiat\", \"Ford\", \"Toyota\"])\n\n# Function to count rows by model\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    counts = zeros(Int, length(unique(df.model)))\n    for (i, m) in enumerate(unique(df.model))\n        counts[i] = sum(df.model .== m)\n    end\n    return counts\nend\n\n# Use function on DataFrame\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nIn this code, we first define a simple DataFrame `df_cars` with column 'model'. We then define the function `count_model_rows`. This function iterates over all unique values in the 'model' column and counts how many times each value appears. The result is stored in an array of integers.\n\nFinally, we use our function on `df_cars` to get the count of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,349],"elapsed":2.948302646,"_type":"aimessage"}]
