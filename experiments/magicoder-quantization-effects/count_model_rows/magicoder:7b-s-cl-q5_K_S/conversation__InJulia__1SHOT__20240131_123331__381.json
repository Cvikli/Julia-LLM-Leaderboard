Then we call the `nrow` function on each group to get the number of rows in each group (i.e., for each model). The results are returned as a Vector of integers.\n\nNote: If you have categorical variables, you may need to convert them to strings or numbers before using this function. This is because DataFrames' `groupby` method does not handle CategoricalArrays directly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,240],"elapsed":2.028815584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
