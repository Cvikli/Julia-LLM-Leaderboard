Then, we use the `combine` function to calculate the number of rows for each model and store it in a new DataFrame called `counts`. The `=>` operator is used to rename the resulting column to \"count\".\n\nYou can then call this function on your DataFrame like so:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\"]) # example dataframe\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will return a new DataFrame with one row for each unique model in `df_cars`, and a column called \"count\" that contains the number of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,263],"elapsed":2.191872316,"_type":"aimessage"}]
