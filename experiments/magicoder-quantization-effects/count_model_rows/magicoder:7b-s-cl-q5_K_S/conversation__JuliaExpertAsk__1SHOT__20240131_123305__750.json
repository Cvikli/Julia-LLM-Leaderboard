The function uses the `groupby` function to create a GroupedDataFrame, then it uses the `combine` function with the `nrow` function to count the number of rows in each group. The result is a new DataFrame where each row corresponds to a unique value in the `model` column and there is one additional column called \"count\" that holds the corresponding row count for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,175],"elapsed":1.477274002,"_type":"aimessage"}]
