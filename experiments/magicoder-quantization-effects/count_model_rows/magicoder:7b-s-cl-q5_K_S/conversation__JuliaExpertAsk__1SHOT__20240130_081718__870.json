It then converts this result to a pandas Series and returns it, which can be used directly with your DataFrame for further analysis or visualization if needed.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```python\ndf_cars = pd.DataFrame({\n    'model': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'B', 'C'],  # Example DataFrame for a column 'model'\n})\nprint(count_model_rows(df_cars))\n```\nThis would return a Series where the index are the unique values in your `model` column and the values are their corresponding counts.","status":200,"tokens":[0,255],"elapsed":2.172313022,"_type":"aimessage"}]
