Here is an example of such a function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = nrow.(grouped)\n    return counts\nend\n```\nIn this code, `groupby(df, :model)` groups the dataframe by the 'model' column. The function `nrow()` then calculates the number of rows for each group. The result is a vector where the i-th element corresponds to the number of rows in the i-th group.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 3], other=[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\", \"f\", \"g\"])\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln.(counts)\n```\nThis will output the number of rows for each model in the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,257],"elapsed":2.167729772,"_type":"aimessage"}]
