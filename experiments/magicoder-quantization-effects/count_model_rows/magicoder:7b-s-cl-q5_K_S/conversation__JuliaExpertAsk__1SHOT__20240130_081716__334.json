Here's an example:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef count_model_rows(df):\n    # Check if column 'model' exists in the dataframe\n    assert 'model' in df.columns, \"Column 'model' does not exist\"\n    \n    # Create a dictionary to store model and their respective counts\n    model_counts = defaultdict(int) \n    \n    # Iterate over each row of the DataFrame\n    for _, row in df.iterrows():\n        # Increment count of that specific model\n        model_counts[row['model']] += 1\n        \n    return dict(model_counts)\n```\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```python\ndf_cars = pd.DataFrame({'model': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'B', 'B'], 'other column': [1,2,3,4,5,6]})  # example dataframe\nprint(count_model_rows(df_cars))   # Output: {'A': 2, 'B': 3, 'C': 1}\n```\nThis will return a dictionary where keys are different models and values are counts of rows for each model. Please replace the column name with your actual column name in your DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,344],"elapsed":2.939318678,"_type":"aimessage"}]
