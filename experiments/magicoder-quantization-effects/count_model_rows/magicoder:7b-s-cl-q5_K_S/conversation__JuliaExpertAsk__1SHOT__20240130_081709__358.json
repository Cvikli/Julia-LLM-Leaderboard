Note: It assumes you've installed DataFrames and have it imported as \"DF\" in your Julia environment.\n\n```julia\nusing DF\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)  # Group by column 'model'\n    grouped_counts = mapreduce(nrow, +, grouped)  # Map each group to the number of rows and reduce using addition (sum)\n    \n    return grouped_counts\nend\n```\nThis function first groups your DataFrame based on the model. Then, for each group (which corresponds to a unique `model`), it calculates the number of rows in that group using `nrow`. This operation is performed for all groups simultaneously by `mapreduce` and then reduced using addition (`+`) to obtain a single result.","status":200,"tokens":[90,197],"elapsed":1.704641457,"_type":"aimessage"}]
