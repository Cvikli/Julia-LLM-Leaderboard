The result is a Vector of integers where the i-th element represents the number of rows in the i-th group.\n\nYou can use this function with your DataFrame like this:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\nprintln.(count_model_rows(df_cars))  # Outputs: 2,1,2,1,2\n```\nThe output indicates that there are 2 rows for the model \"a4\", 1 row for the model \"a6\", and so on.","status":200,"tokens":[244,242],"elapsed":7.199756888,"_type":"aimessage"}]
