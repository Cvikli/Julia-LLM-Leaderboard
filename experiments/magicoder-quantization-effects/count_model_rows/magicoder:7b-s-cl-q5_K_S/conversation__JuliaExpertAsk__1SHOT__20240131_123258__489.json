The result is a new dataframe where each row represents a unique model from the original dataframe, and the value in the first (and only) column is the number of rows that had that model.\n\nYou can use it like this:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\"])\ncounts = count_model_rows(df)\n```\nThis will create a dataframe with columns `model` and `first`, where the value in the `first` column is the number of rows that had each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,242],"elapsed":2.042949415,"_type":"aimessage"}]
