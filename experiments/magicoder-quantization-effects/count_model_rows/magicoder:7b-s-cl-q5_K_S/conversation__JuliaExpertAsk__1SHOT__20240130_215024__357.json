The `nrow` function is used inside `combine` to count the number of rows in each group. \n\nYou can then call this function with your DataFrame as follows:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"A\", \"C\", \"B\"])\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThis will return a new DataFrame `counts` where each row corresponds to a unique model in the original DataFrame, and the second column contains the number of rows for that model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,234],"elapsed":1.953386134,"_type":"aimessage"}]
