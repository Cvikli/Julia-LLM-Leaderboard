Then, the `nrow` function will count the number of rows in each group:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    df_grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    model_counts = combine(df_grouped, nrow => first)\nend\n```\nIn the above code:\n- `groupby` function is used to group data by column 'model'.\n- `combine` function is used to apply a function over each group and return a new DataFrame. Here we are using `nrow => first` which counts number of rows in each group and assigns it as the value for that row in the new DataFrame.\n\nYou can use this function like:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"BMW\", \"Audi\", \"BMW\", \"Mercedes\", \"BMW\"])\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will return a new DataFrame with each unique model and the count of rows for that model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,272],"elapsed":2.295184617,"_type":"aimessage"}]
