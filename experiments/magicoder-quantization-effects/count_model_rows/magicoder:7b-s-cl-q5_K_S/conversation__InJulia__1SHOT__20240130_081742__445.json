It then uses the `combine` function to calculate the number of rows in each group and returns a new DataFrame containing these counts, with the column name set as \"count\".\n\nHere's an example of how you can use it:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Random  # include necessary packages\nRandom.seed!(123)         # for reproducibility\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[string(\"Car\", i) for i in 1:50], othercols=rand(1:100,50))\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will return a new DataFrame with the model names as its row indices and the counts of rows per model in another column named \"count\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,268],"elapsed":2.249336278,"_type":"aimessage"}]
