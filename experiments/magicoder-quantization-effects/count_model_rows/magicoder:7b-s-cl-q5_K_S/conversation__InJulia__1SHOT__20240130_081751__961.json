Here is an example:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n    nrow.(grouped)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a dataframe as input and returns an array of integers representing the number of rows in each group. The `groupby` function separates the data into groups based on the values in the column specified (in this case `:model`). The `.` operator is used to apply the `nrow` function to each group, which gives the count of rows in that group.","status":200,"tokens":[0,158],"elapsed":1.345230281,"_type":"aimessage"}]
