It then calculates the number of rows for each group using the `nrow` function on the grouped data. The result is a vector where the i-th element corresponds to the number of rows in the i-th group.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", \"A\", \"B\"])\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nfor (i, model) in enumerate(unique(df_cars.model))\n    println(\"Model $model has $(counts[i]) rows\")\nend\n```\n\nThis will print out the number of rows for each unique model in the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[90,261],"elapsed":2.20724098,"_type":"aimessage"}]
