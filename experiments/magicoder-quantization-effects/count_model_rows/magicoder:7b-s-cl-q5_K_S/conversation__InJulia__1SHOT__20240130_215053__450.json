Then it uses the `combine` function to calculate the number of rows (`nrow`) for each group and assigns this count to a new column named `\"count\"`. The result is a new DataFrame where each row represents a unique model from the original DataFrame, and the corresponding count in the `\"count\"` column shows how many times that model appears.\n\nYou can use it like so:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", \"A\", \"B\"])\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\ndisplay(result) # to print the result\n```\nThis will output:\n```julia\n| Row | model | count |\n|-----|-------|-------|\n| 1   | A     | 2     |\n| 2   | B     | 2     |\n| 3   | C     | 1     |\n| 4   | D     | 1     |\n| 5   | E     | 1     |\n| 6   | F     | 1     |\n```\nThis shows that the model \"A\" appears twice, \"B\" also appears twice and so on.","status":200,"tokens":[0,376],"elapsed":3.148614311,"_type":"aimessage"}]
