Then it uses `combine` to calculate the number of rows for each group. The result is a new dataframe where each row represents a unique model and its count in the original dataframe.\n\nYou can then call this function with your DataFrame as an argument:\n```julia\ndf_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,225],"elapsed":1.894734141,"_type":"aimessage"}]
