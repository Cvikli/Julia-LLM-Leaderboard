Then we group it by 'model'. After that, we use `combine` function from `GroupedDataFrame` in combination with `sum`. This will sum all values in 'count' column for each 'model'. Lastly, we return the counts of rows (which is the only column remaining).\n\nYou can test this function by calling it like this:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will output the counts of rows for each model in the DataFrame:\n```julia\n2-element Vector{Int64}:\n 3\n 1\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,308],"elapsed":2.421069296,"_type":"aimessage"}]
