We'll create a function `count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)` to count the number of rows per model:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = combine(length, grouped)\n    return counts\nend\n\n# Use the function with some sample data\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model = [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"B\", \"A\"])\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n\nprintln(\"Counts:\")\nfor (k, v) in pairs(result)\n    println(\"Model $k has $(v) rows.\")\nend\n```\nThis script will group the data by `model` and then count how many rows there are for each one. It will output a DataFrame with one column (the counts), indexed by model. Each row of this DataFrame corresponds to a unique value in the `model` column, and the number of rows in that model.\n\nPlease note you need to have installed DataFrames.jl package in your Julia environment. You can add it using Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\").","status":200,"tokens":[0,292],"elapsed":2.248178775,"_type":"aimessage"}]
