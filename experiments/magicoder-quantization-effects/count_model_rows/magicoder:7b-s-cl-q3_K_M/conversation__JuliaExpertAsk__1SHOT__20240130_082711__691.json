Then it uses the `combine()` function to calculate the number of rows for each group (which is equivalent to counting the number of rows in each group). The result is a new DataFrame with grouped data and their counts.\n\nNote that if you have any missing values in your 'model' column, this function will treat them as separate groups because `groupby()` by default treats missing values as separate categories. If you want to exclude these from the count, add `skipmissing=true` argument to `groupby()`.","status":200,"tokens":[90,197],"elapsed":1.536573482,"_type":"aimessage"}]
