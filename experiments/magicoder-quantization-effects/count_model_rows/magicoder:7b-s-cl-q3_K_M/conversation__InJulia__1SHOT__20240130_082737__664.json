The following example shows how to implement this:\n\nFirst, let's assume that we have a DataFrame \"df_cars\" containing a column named \"model\". Here is an example of how you could write your function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nusing GroupedData\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    return nrow.(grouped)\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `groupby` function from the \"GroupedData\" package to divide the DataFrame into groups based on the values in the \"model\" column. Then it uses the `nrow` function from the \"GroupedData\" package to calculate the number of rows for each group and return these numbers as a vector.","status":200,"tokens":[0,203],"elapsed":1.551563644,"_type":"aimessage"}]
