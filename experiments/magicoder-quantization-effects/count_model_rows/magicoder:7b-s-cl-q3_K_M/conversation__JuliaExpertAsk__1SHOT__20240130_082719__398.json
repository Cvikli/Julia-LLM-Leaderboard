Then we simply use the `nrow()` function to count how many rows each group has. This is done for every unique value in the `model` column, and thus gives a count of rows per model.\n\nYou can call this function with your DataFrame as an argument like so:\n```julia\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will return a dictionary or Dict where keys are unique models from `df_cars` and values - number of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,209],"elapsed":1.608149207,"_type":"aimessage"}]
