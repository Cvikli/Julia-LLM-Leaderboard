Here is a simple example:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    return nrow.(grouped)\nend\n\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nIn this code, `groupby` groups the dataframe `df_cars` by the column 'model'. The function `nrow` then counts how many rows are in each group. The result is returned as a vector of integers where index i corresponds to the count of rows for the model with name df[i,\"model\"].\n\nThe output will be:\n```julia\n3-element Vector{Int64}:\n 2\n 1\n 2\n```\nThis indicates that there are 2 rows for 'a4' and 'a6', and 2 rows for 'q7'.","status":200,"tokens":[0,251],"elapsed":1.942361577,"_type":"aimessage"}]
