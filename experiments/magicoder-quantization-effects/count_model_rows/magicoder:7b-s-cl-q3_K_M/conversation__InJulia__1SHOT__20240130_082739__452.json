It uses `groupby` from DataFrames to group the data by the \"model\" column.\n2. Then it counts the number of rows in each grouped data using `nrow`.\n\nYou can use your function like this:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"A\", \"C\"])\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(result)\n```\nThis will print the number of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,288],"elapsed":2.209162207,"_type":"aimessage"}]
