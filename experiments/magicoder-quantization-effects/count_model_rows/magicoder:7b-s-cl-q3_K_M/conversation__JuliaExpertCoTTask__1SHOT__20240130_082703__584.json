Here is a simple solution:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, CategoricalArrays\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return df |> \n           groupby(:model) |> \n           nrow\nend\n```\n\nThis function groups the dataframe by column \"model\" and then counts how many rows are in each group. The result is a Vector where the i-th element corresponds to the number of rows in the i-th group.\n\nWhen you use this function with your example DataFrame:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\nprintln(count_model_rows(df_cars))\n```\nYou'll get `[2, 1, 2]` which corresponds to the number of rows for each model `[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"q7\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,225],"elapsed":1.737251956,"_type":"aimessage"}]
