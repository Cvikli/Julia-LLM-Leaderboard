[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can implement this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestion = false\n    inAnswer = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestion = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inQuestion = false\n            inAnswer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if inQuestion && !isempty(line)\n            question *= line[end-1:end]\n        elseif inAnswer && !isempty(line)\n            answer *= line[end-1:end]\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each line of the input markdown string. If a line starts with \"# Question\", it sets `inQuestion` to true and continues to the next line. Similarly, if a line starts with \"# Answer\", it sets `inAnswer` to true and continues to the next line. If `inQuestion` is true and the current line is not empty (to avoid processing blank lines), it appends the last character of the line to `question`. Similar logic applies for `answer`.\n\nAfter going through all the lines, it returns a tuple containing the stripped strings `question` and `answer`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,335],"elapsed":3.205917266,"_type":"aimessage"}]
