Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might write this function using Julia's `eachline` method to iterate over lines in the markdown file:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    reading_question = false\n    reading_answer = false\n    \n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            reading_question = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            reading_question = false\n            reading_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if reading_question\n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif reading_answer\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each line in the markdown text. If it encounters a line starting with \"# Question\", it starts recording question text. If it encounters a line starting with \"# Answer\", it stops recording question text and starts recording answer text. It then returns a tuple of the extracted question and answer texts, stripped of leading spaces and newlines.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is exactly one `# Question` section followed by exactly one `# Answer` section in the markdown file. If your markdown files can have multiple questions or answers, you'll need a more complex solution to handle that.","status":200,"tokens":[0,329],"elapsed":3.167037281,"_type":"aimessage"}]
