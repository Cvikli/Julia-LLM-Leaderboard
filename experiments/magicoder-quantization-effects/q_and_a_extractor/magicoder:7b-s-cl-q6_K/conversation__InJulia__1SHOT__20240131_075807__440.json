Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

If a line starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`, it sets the corresponding flag to true, and continues to the next line. If the current line is not indented (i.e., does not start with a space) and the question/answer flag is set, it appends the text to the respective variable. Finally, it returns the extracted question and answer after stripping any leading spaces or newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,307],"elapsed":2.913786688,"_type":"aimessage"}]
