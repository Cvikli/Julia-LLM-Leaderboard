Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

The `re.DOTALL` flag is used to make `.` match any character, including newline. After extracting the text, leading spaces and newlines are removed using `re.sub()`. If there's no question or answer in the given markdown, it returns `None`.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```python\nmd = \"\"\"\n### Question\nThis is a sample question with multiple lines of text.\nIt can have any number of lines and symbols like $ or % etc.\n\n### Answer\nThis is the corresponding answer for the above question.\nAgain, it has multiple lines of text and symbols as well.\n\"\"\"\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(md))  # Outputs: ('Thisisasamplques...', 'Thisisthecorrespondinganswerfor...')\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,359],"elapsed":3.455439769,"_type":"aimessage"}]
