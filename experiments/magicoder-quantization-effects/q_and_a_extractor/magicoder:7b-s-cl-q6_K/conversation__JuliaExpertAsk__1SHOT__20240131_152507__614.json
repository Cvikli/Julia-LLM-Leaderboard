Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            continue\n        end\n        if startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        if in_question && !startswith(line, \" \") && line != \"\"\n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif in_answer && !startswith(line, \" \") && line != \"\"\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the markdown text into lines and then iterating over each line. If a line is found that starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it sets `in_question` or `in_answer` to `true`. Any subsequent lines that do not start with spaces are considered part of either the question or answer, depending on the current mode. The `strip(line)` function removes any leading spaces and newlines from each line before concatenating them into the question and answer strings.\n\nYou can test this function with some sample input:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nThis is a sample question?\n\n# Answer\nThis is the answer to the question above.\n\"\"\"\n@show q_and_a_extractor(md)\n```\nThis should output `(question=\"This is a sample question?\", answer=\"This is the answer to the question above.\")`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,394],"elapsed":3.796987497,"_type":"aimessage"}]
