If it encounters a line starting with `# Question`, it starts capturing question text. Similarly for answer. It also strips leading whitespace and newline characters from each section of the text before returning them as a tuple. The `strip` function is used to remove any extra leading spaces or newlines at the end of the extracted sections.","status":200,"tokens":[0,357],"elapsed":3.467017314,"_type":"aimessage"}]
