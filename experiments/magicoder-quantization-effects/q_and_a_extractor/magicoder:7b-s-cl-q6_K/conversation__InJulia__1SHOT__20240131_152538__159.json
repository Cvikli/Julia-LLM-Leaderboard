Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

If a line starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`, it sets the corresponding boolean to `true`. For all other lines, if we are inside a question or answer (based on the booleans), it appends the stripped content of that line to the appropriate string variable (`question` or `answer`). After going through all lines, it returns the question and answer in a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,298],"elapsed":2.852741981,"_type":"aimessage"}]
