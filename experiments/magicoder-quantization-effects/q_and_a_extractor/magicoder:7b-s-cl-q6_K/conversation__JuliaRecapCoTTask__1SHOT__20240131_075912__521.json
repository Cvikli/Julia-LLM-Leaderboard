[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple solution using regular expressions to extract the sections:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer\n    question = matchall(r\"# Question(.*?)# Answer\", md, 1)\n    answer = matchall(r\"# Answer(.*)\", md, 1)\n    \n    # Strip leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text\n    question = replace.(question, r\"\\n\\s*\" => \"\")\n    answer = replace.(answer, r\"\\n\\s*\" => \"\")\n    \n    return (join(question), join(answer))\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses `matchall` to find all occurrences of the pattern in the markdown text. The pattern `# Question(.*?)# Answer` matches any text between `# Question` and `# Answer`. The `.*?` makes it non-greedy, so it stops at the first `# Answer`, not the last one.\n\nThe `join` function is used to concatenate all the matched sections into a single string. This is necessary because `matchall` returns an array of matches, which can be multiple strings if there are multiple occurrences in the markdown text. \n\nThen, `replace(str::AbstractString, pattern::Regex)` is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from each extracted section. The `\\n\\s*` pattern matches any newline followed by zero or more spaces.","status":200,"tokens":[0,331],"elapsed":3.244823104,"_type":"aimessage"}]
