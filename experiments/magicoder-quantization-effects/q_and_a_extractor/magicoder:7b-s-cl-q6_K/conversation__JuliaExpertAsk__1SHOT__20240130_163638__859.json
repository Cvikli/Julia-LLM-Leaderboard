Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple Python solution using regular expressions:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = re.findall(r'\\n## Question\\n(.+?)\\n', md, re.DOTALL)  # DOTALL for making . also match new line character\n    answer = re.findall(r'\\n## Answer\\n(.+?)\\n', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # Strip leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text\n    question = [re.sub(r'^[\\s\\n]+|[\\s\\n]+$', '', i).strip() for i in question]\n    answer = [re.sub(r'^[\\s\\n]+|[\\s\\n]+$', '', i).strip() for i in answer]\n    \n    return (question[0], answer[0]) if question and answer else (None, None)\n```\n\nThis function first uses the `findall` method from Python's `re` module to find all matches of the regular expressions for questions and answers. The `(.+?)` part of the regexp captures all text between the delimiters. \n\nThe `re.DOTALL` flag makes `.` match newlines, which is necessary since markdown allows paragraph breaks with multiple spaces in Markdown files.\n\nNext, we use a list comprehension to strip any leading spaces or newline characters from the extracted text using regular expressions. We replace `^[\\s\\n]+|[\\s\\n]+$` with an empty string (`''`), which effectively removes all instances of this pattern. The `.strip()` method is used to remove any remaining whitespace at both ends of the string.\n\nFinally, we return the first item in each list (there should be only one question and answer), or `(None, None)` if no questions or answers were found.","status":200,"tokens":[0,422],"elapsed":4.113374597,"_type":"aimessage"}]
