Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you might write that function:\n\n```julia\nimport Base.strip\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestion = false\n    inAnswer = false\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestion = true\n            continue\n        end\n        if startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inQuestion = false\n            inAnswer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        if inQuestion && line != \"\"\n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif inAnswer && line != \"\"\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function iterates through each line of the input markdown. If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\", it sets a flag `inQuestion` to true and continues processing the next lines until it finds another section or reaches the end of the text. It does similar logic for the Answer section. All extracted questions and answers are concatenated and returned as a tuple. The `strip()` function is used to remove any leading spaces and newlines from the text before adding it to the respective question or answer variable.","status":200,"tokens":[0,285],"elapsed":2.816566668,"_type":"aimessage"}]
