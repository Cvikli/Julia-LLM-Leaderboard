[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use regular expressions to parse your markdown text. Here's how you might approach this:\n\n```julia\nusing DotPlus\nimport README\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(strip(md), '\\n')\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    in_question, in_answer = false, false \n    \n    for line in lines\n        if match(r\"^# Question\", line).match !== nothing\n            in_question = true\n        elseif match(r\"^# Answer\", line).match !== nothing\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n        end\n        \n        if in_question \n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we first split the markdown string by newline characters to get a list of lines. Then for each line: \n- If it starts with \"# Question\", we start capturing questions. \n- If it starts with \"# Answer\", we stop capturing questions and start capturing answers. \n- We strip leading whitespace from both the question and answer strings by concatenating them onto `question` or `answer`, respectively, without leading spaces. The resulting function will return a tuple of the extracted question and answer text stripped of any leading spaces or newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,329],"elapsed":3.259454595,"_type":"aimessage"}]
