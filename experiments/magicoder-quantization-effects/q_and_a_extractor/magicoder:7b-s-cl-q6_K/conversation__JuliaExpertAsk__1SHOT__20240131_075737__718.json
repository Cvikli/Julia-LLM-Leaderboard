Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

The `re.DOTALL` flag makes sure that `.+?` matches any character, including newlines. \n\nThe `.strip()` method is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text. If no question or answer section was found in the markdown text, the function returns `None`.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that there will be only one `# Question` and `# Answer` sections in the given markdown text. If there can be multiple such sections, you would need to modify the regular expressions accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,253],"elapsed":2.420156344,"_type":"aimessage"}]
