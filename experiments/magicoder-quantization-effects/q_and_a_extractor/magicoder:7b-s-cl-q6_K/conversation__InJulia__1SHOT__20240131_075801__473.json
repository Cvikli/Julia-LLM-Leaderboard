[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem using Julia's regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = match(r\"# Question\\n(.*?)(?=\\n##|\\Z)\", md, re.MULTILINE | re.DOTALL).captures[1]\n    answer = match(r\"# Answer\\n(.*?)(?=\\n##|\\Z)\", md, re.MULTILINE | re.DOTALL).captures[1]\n    \n    # Remove leading spaces and newlines\n    question = replace(question, r\"^[\\s]*\\n\" => \"\")\n    answer = replace(answer, r\"^[\\s]*\\n\" => \"\")\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to match the sections of text that start with `# Question` and `# Answer`. The `captures[1]` is used to extract the first matching group. The `re.MULTILINE | re.DOTALL` flags are used to make the `.` character in the regex match any character, including newline characters.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there will be exactly one `# Question` and `# Answer` section in the input markdown string. If your markdown can have multiple sections of either type, you would need a different approach.","status":200,"tokens":[0,306],"elapsed":2.925431192,"_type":"aimessage"}]
