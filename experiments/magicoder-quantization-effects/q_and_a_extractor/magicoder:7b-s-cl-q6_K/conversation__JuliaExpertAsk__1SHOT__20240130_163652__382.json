If it does, it toggles a corresponding flag. If the flag is on and the line isn't empty, it appends the stripped text to the respective section. After going through all lines, it returns a tuple of (question, answer).\n\nIt assumes that there are no nested or incorrectly formatted sections. The `#` symbol at the start of each section is only used for formatting and doesn't signify different sections as in HTML headers.","status":200,"tokens":[0,394],"elapsed":3.896736902,"_type":"aimessage"}]
