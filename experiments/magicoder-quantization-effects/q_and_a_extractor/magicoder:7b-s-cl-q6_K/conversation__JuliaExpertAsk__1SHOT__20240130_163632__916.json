When these are found, it sets a flag to indicate that we're inside the corresponding section. \n\nWhen we're inside the appropriate section (i.e., `in_question=true` or `in_answer=true`), it adds the line to the relevant text section (`question` or `answer`) after stripping leading spaces and newlines using the `strip` function.\n\nFinally, once all lines have been processed, the function returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer text.","status":200,"tokens":[128,311],"elapsed":3.071149643,"_type":"aimessage"}]
