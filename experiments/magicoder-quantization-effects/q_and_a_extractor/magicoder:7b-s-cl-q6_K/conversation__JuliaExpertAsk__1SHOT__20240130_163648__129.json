Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function that uses regular expressions to solve this problem:\n\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Extracts all lines between \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\", stripping leading spaces and newlines.\n    question = replace(matchall(r\"\\n#+ Question\\n(.+?)(?=\\n#+ Answer|\\Z)\", md).captures[1], r\"\\n|^\\s*\" => \"\")\n\n    # Extracts all lines after \"# Answer\", stripping leading spaces and newlines.\n    answer = replace(matchall(r\"(?<=\\n#+ Answer\\n)([\\s\\S]+?)(?=\\Z)\", md).captures[1], r\"\\n|^\\s*\" => \"\")\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses two regular expressions: one to match all lines between \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\", and the other to match all lines after \"# Answer\". The `matchall` function returns an array of matching substrings, which we then use with `captures` to extract the actual matches. The replace functions are used to strip leading spaces and newlines from each extracted section.\n\nPlease note that this is a simple solution and may not work perfectly for all types of markdown documents. In particular, if your document includes indented code blocks or other special cases, it might be necessary to use a more advanced parsing library than RegularExpressions.jl.","status":200,"tokens":[0,334],"elapsed":3.283219352,"_type":"aimessage"}]
