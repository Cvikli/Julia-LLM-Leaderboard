[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could implement this function using Julia's regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Extract questions and answers\n    q = matchall(r\"# Question(.+?)(?=^# Answer|\\Z)\", md, flags = re.MULTILINE | re.DOTALL)\n    a = matchall(r\"# Answer(.+?)\", md, flags = re.MULTILINE | re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # Remove leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text\n    q = map(x -> replace(x, r\"^[ \\t]*\\n\" => \"\"), q)\n    a = map(x -> replace(x, r\"^[ \\t]*\\n\" => \"\"), a)\n    \n    return (q, a)\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, `matchall` is used to find all matches in the markdown text that follow the specified pattern. The `r\"...\"` syntax defines a regular expression. The `.+?` part of the regex means \"one or more any characters, but as few as possible\". The `(?=...)` is a positive lookahead assertion, which ensures that the next character does not start another match. The `\\Z` matches at the end of the string.\n\nThe `replace(x, r\"^[ \\t]*\\n\" => \"\")` part removes leading spaces and newlines from each extracted text section. This is done using Julia's built-in replace function with a regular expression to match any number of spaces or tabs at the beginning of a line (`r\"^[ \\t]*\\n\"`), and then replacing that match with nothing (`=> \"\"`).\n\nFinally, we return a tuple containing the extracted questions and answers.","status":200,"tokens":[0,408],"elapsed":4.021969317,"_type":"aimessage"}]
