[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could solve this problem using regular expressions in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = match(r\"# Question\\n(.*?)(?=\\n## Answer)\", md, re.MULTILINE | re.DOTALL).captures[1]\n    answer = match(r\"# Answer\\n(.*?)(?=\\n#)\", md, re.MULTILINE | re.DOTALL).captures[1]\n    \n    # Strip leading spaces and newlines\n    question = replace(question, r\"^[\\s]*\\n\" => \"\")\n    answer = replace(answer, r\"^[\\s]*\\n\" => \"\")\n\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to match the sections of the markdown text that start with `# Question` and `# Answer`. The `captures[1]` gets the first capture group from the regex match, which is the text inside those sections. \n\nThe `strip()` function removes leading spaces and newlines from the strings. The `.*?` in the regular expression makes it non-greedy, so it stops matching at the first `#`, not the last one. \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that there is only one question and answer per markdown text. If there can be multiple questions or answers, you would need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[98,323],"elapsed":3.11852275,"_type":"aimessage"}]
