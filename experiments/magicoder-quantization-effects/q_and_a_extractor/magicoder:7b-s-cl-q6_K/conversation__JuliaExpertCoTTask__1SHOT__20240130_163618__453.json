Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    q_start = findfirst(==(\"# Question\"), md)\n    a_start = findfirst(==(\"# Answer\"), md)\n    \n    if isnothing(q_start) || isnothing(a_start)\n        return nothing\n    end\n    \n    question = strip(md[q_start.start:min(a_start.start-1, length(md))])\n    answer = strip(md[a_start.start+len(\"# Answer\"):end])\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nHere `findfirst` is used to find the index of the start of \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\".

The end marker for the answer does not include the \"# Answer\" part because it's already included in the question start marker, so we subtract len(\"# Answer\") from its index. \nThe function finally returns a tuple containing the question and the answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,275],"elapsed":2.707041216,"_type":"aimessage"}]
