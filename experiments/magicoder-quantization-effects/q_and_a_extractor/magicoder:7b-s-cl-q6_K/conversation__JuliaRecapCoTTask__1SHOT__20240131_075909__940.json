[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple solution using Julia's built-in regular expression (regex) functionality:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Extract the text between `# Question` and `# Answer`\n    question = match(r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n# Answer\", md, re\"s\")\n    \n    if question === nothing \n        return (\"No question found.\", \"No answer found.\")\n    end\n    \n    # Extract the text following `# Question` and before `# Answer`\n    question_text = strip(question.captures[1])\n    \n    # Extract the text after `# Answer`\n    answer = match(r\"# Answer\\n(.*)\", md, re\"s\")\n    answer_text = strip(answer.captures[1])\n    \n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find the sections of the markdown text that start with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively. The `match()` function returns a match object if it finds a match in the string, otherwise it returns `nothing`. If there is no question found, it will return (\"No question found.\", \"No answer found.\") as a default answer.\n\nThe `.captures[1]` part of the match object gives us the text that matched the first (and only) capture group in the regex pattern. The `strip()` function removes leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\nYou can call this function with your markdown string like so:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\n    This is a question?\n# Answer\n    Yes, this is an answer!\n\"\"\"\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md))  # Outputs: (\"This is a question?\", \"Yes, this is an answer!\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,418],"elapsed":4.106446701,"_type":"aimessage"}]
