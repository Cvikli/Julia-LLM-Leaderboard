[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem, we can use regular expressions in Julia to find sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, then strip any leading spaces or newlines:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question = match(r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n# Answer\", md, re.MULTILINE | re.DOTALL).captures[1]\n    answer = match(r\"# Answer\\n(.*?)($|\\n#)\", md, re.MULTILINE | re.DOTALL).captures[1]\n    \n    # strip leading spaces and newlines\n    question = replace(question, r\"^[ \\t]*\\n\" => \"\")\n    answer = replace(answer, r\"^[ \\t]*\\n\" => \"\")\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n``` \nThis function returns a tuple with the extracted text from the Question and Answer sections of the markdown.\n\nPlease make sure you have installed the necessary package to use regular expressions in Julia by using `using REGEX` before running this function. If it is not available, you may need to install it via Pkg or add it into your Project file manually.","status":200,"tokens":[0,279],"elapsed":2.768582577,"_type":"aimessage"}]
