[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can implement this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question = replace(line[13:end], r\"^[ \\t]*(.*?)$\", s\"\\1\")\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer = replace(line[10:end], r\"^[ \\t]*(.*?)$\", s\"\\1\")\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function first splits the markdown text into individual lines. Then it iterates over each line. If a line starts with \"# Question\", it extracts the content after that and assigns it to `question`. Similarly, if a line starts with \"# Answer\", it extracts the content after that and assigns it to `answer`. The function then returns a tuple of `question` and `answer`.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is only one question and answer in the markdown text. If there are multiple questions or answers, you would need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,283],"elapsed":2.702047825,"_type":"aimessage"}]
