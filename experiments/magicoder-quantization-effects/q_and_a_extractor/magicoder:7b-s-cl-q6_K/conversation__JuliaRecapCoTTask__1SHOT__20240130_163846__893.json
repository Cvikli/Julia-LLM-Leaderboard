[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a basic function that can extract the question and answer from a markdown-formatted string:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestion = false\n    inAnswer = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestion = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inAnswer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if inQuestion && !startswith(line, \"##\")\n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif inAnswer && !startswith(line, \"##\")\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the input markdown into lines and then scanning each line for special markers. If it encounters a line that starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`, it toggles a flag to indicate whether we are currently in a question or an answer section. If it sees a line that is not part of a section, it appends the text to the appropriate section (after stripping leading spaces and newlines). \n\nThis function assumes that each section is on its own line and does not handle nested sections well. However, if the input markdown always uses a `# Question` / `# Answer` structure in this way, it should work fine.","status":200,"tokens":[0,336],"elapsed":3.339594005,"_type":"aimessage"}]
