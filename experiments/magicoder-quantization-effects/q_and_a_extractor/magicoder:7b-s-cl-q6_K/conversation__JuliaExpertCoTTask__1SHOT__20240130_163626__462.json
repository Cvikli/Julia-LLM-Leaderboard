Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple Python program that does this:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    match = re.findall('(?<=# Question\\n)(.*?)(?=\\n# Answer)', md, re.DOTALL)\n    question = ' '.join([i.lstrip() for i in match[0].split('\\n')]) if match else ''\n    \n    match = re.findall('(?<=# Answer\\n)(.*)', md, re.DOTALL)\n    answer = ' '.join([i.lstrip() for i in match[0].split('\\n')]) if match else ''\n    \n    return (question,answer)\n\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n# Answer\\nThe capital of France is Paris.\"))\n```\nThis program uses regular expressions to find the sections with the questions and answers. The `re.DOTALL` flag allows the dot in a regular expression to match any character, not just newlines. \n\nThe extracted text is then stripped of leading spaces using list comprehension and the lstrip method. It's converted back into a single string by joining on whitespace before being returned as a tuple.\n\nWhen the given `md` input string is passed to this function, it should return a tuple containing 'What is the capital of France?' as the question and 'The capital of France is Paris.' as the answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,334],"elapsed":3.311942878,"_type":"aimessage"}]
