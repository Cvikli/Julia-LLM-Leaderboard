[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible solution using Julia's built-in Markdown parsing functionality:\n\n```julia\nusing Documenter\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(strip(md), '\\n')\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    in_question, in_answer = false, false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n        end\n        \n        if in_question && !isempty(line)\n            question *= line[end] == '#' ? line[2:end] : line\n        elseif in_answer && !isempty(line)\n            answer *= line[end] == '#' ? line[2:end] : line\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each line in the markdown string. If it encounters a line starting with \"# Question\", it sets `in_question` to true and starts collecting text for the question. Similarly, if it encounters a line starting with \"# Answer\", it sets `in_answer` to true and starts collecting text for the answer. It continues this until it has collected both the question and the answer.\n\nNote that this function assumes that each section (question or answer) is on its own line, separated by lines containing only `#`. If there are other sections in your markdown file, you would need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[398,367],"elapsed":3.649456857,"_type":"aimessage"}]
