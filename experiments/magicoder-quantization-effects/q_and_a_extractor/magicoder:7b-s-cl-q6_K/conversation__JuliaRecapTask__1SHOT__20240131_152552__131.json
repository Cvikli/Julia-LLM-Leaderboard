[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of this task using Julia's built-in string manipulation functions:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    inQuestion = false\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestion = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inQuestion = false\n        elseif inQuestion && !isempty(strip(line))\n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif !inQuestion && !isempty(strip(line))\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\n\nHere is how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nHow do I solve this problem?\n\n# Answer\nYou should write code to solve it!\n\"\"\"\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md)) # prints (\"How do I solve this problem?\", \"You should write code to solve it!\")\n```\nThis function splits the input markdown text into lines and then checks each line for the start of a question or answer section. If it finds such a line, it starts recording the corresponding text until it encounters another section header or an empty line (indicating end of the section). It also ignores any leading spaces and newlines when recording the text. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is only one question and one answer in your markdown text, and that they are separated by at least one blank line. If your markdown has multiple questions or answers, you would need a different approach.","status":200,"tokens":[0,394],"elapsed":3.879345825,"_type":"aimessage"}]
