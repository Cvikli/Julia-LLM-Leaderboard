[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestion = false\n    inAnswer = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestion = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inAnswer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if inQuestion && !startswith(line, \" \")\n            question *= line[2:end]\n        elseif inAnswer && !startswith(line, \" \")\n            answer *= line[2:end]\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the markdown text into lines and iterating over each line. If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it sets the corresponding flag to true and continues to the next line. If it encounters a line that is not indented (i.e., does not start with \" \") and the question/answer flag is set, it appends the text to the question/answer string respectively. Finally, it returns a tuple of stripped strings for the question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,309],"elapsed":2.944317009,"_type":"aimessage"}]
