[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could solve this problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    lines = split(strip(md), '\\n')\n    \n    inQuestion = false\n    for line in lines \n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestion = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inQuestion = false\n        end\n        \n        if inQuestion && !isempty(strip(line))\n            question *= strip(line) * \"\\n\"\n        elseif !inQuestion && !isempty(strip(line))\n            answer *= strip(line) * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nThis function first splits the input markdown into lines and iterates through each line. If a line starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`, it sets the corresponding boolean flag (`inQuestion`). If the current line is not empty and we are currently inside a question section, it appends the stripped line to the `question`; similarly for answer section. It finally returns a tuple of the extracted question and answer after going through all lines.\n\nPlease remember that this function doesn't account for nested sections (like \"Question 1\" within \"Answer 2\"), or for markdown features like indentation or lists. If you need to handle these cases, you would need to update your solution accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,334],"elapsed":3.308903831,"_type":"aimessage"}]
