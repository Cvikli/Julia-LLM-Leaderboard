[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might implement this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    current_section = \"\"\n\n    for line in split(md, '\\n')\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            current_section = \"question\"\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            current_section = \"answer\"\n        elseif current_section == \"question\" && !isempty(line)\n            question *= line[2:end] * \"\\n\"\n        elseif current_section == \"answer\" && !isempty(line)\n            answer *= line[2:end] * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nThis function splits the input string into lines and iterates over each line. If a line starts with \"# Question\", it switches to collecting question text. Similarly, if a line starts with \"# Answer\", it switches to collecting answer text. It then appends the stripped content of each line (excluding the initial '#') to either the question or answer string.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is only one question and one answer in the markdown, and that they are correctly formatted as per your instructions. If there can be multiple questions/answers or if they could be incorrectly formatted, you would need a more complex parsing logic to handle these cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,339],"elapsed":3.243580398,"_type":"aimessage"}]
