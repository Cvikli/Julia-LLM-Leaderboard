Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

If it encounters a line starting with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it switches to that section. Any subsequent non-indented lines are added to the current section until another section header is encountered. The `strip` function is used to remove any leading spaces or newlines from the extracted text.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nThis is a question?\n\n# Answer\nThis is an answer!\n\"\"\"\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: \", question)\nprintln(\"Answer: \", answer)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```julia\nQuestion: This is a question?\nAnswer: This is an answer!\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,379],"elapsed":3.622042252,"_type":"aimessage"}]
