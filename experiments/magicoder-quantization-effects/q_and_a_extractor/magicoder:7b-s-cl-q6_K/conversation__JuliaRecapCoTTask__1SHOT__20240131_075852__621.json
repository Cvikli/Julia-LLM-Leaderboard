[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution using Julia's regular expression (regex) package `Regex` for extracting the question and answer sections:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Find all sections starting with '# Question' or '# Answer'\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"^(# Question|# Answer)\\n(.*?)(?=\\n^(?!# Question|# Answer))\", md, 1));\n    \n    if length(matches) == 2\n        # Extract the text without leading spaces and newlines\n        question = strip(matches[1].match[2])\n        answer   = strip(matches[2].match[2])\n        \n        return (question, answer)\n    else\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Markdown does not contain both a 'Question' and an 'Answer' section.\"))\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `eachmatch` function to find all matches of the regex pattern in the markdown string. The pattern starts with either `# Question` or `# Answer`, followed by any characters (`.*?`) until it finds another section (`(?=\\n^(?!# Question|# Answer))`). The `.*` is a non-greedy match, meaning it will stop at the first possible match of the next regex part.\n\nThe `strip` function removes leading spaces and newlines from the text.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that there are exactly two sections starting with `# Question` or `# Answer`, and that they are in order (question first, answer second). If these assumptions do not hold, an error will be thrown.","status":200,"tokens":[11,363],"elapsed":3.581634474,"_type":"aimessage"}]
