Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you can solve this problem using regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nimport Base.Regex\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = match(r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n## Answer\", md, regex=true)[1]\n    answer = match(r\"## Answer\\n(.*)\", md, regex=true)[1]\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function first uses the `match` function from Base.Regex module to find the text between `# Question` and `# Answer` and then it extracts and strips leading spaces and newlines. The extracted question and answer are returned in a tuple. Note that this implementation assumes that there is only one pair of `# Question` and `# Answer` tags, and each tag appears on its own line. \n\nPlease note that you might need to modify the pattern based on your exact markdown format, if it doesn't strictly follow the format above. For example, if you have multiple questions or answers per document, you may want a more complex pattern which can handle such cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,248],"elapsed":2.428051194,"_type":"aimessage"}]
