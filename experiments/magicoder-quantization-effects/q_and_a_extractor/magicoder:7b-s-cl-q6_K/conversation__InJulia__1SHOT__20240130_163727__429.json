[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the function `q_and_a_extractor` using regular expressions (regex):\n\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = matchall(r\"# Question\\n(.*?)(?=\\n##|$)\", md, regex=false)[1]\n    answer   = matchall(r\"# Answer\\n(.*?)(?=\\n##|$)\", md, regex=false)[1]\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThe function `q_and_a_extractor` uses the `matchall` method of Julia's RegularExpressions module to find all matches in `md` that fit the patterns `# Question\\n(.*?)(?=\\n##|$)`, and `# Answer\\n(.*?)(?=\\n##|$)`. The `.*?` inside the parentheses is a lazy match (`.*?`) meaning it will stop matching at the first occurrence of `\\n##`, which ensures we only get text that lies between a `Question` header and an `Answer` header.\n\nNote: This function assumes that there's exactly one `# Question` and one `# Answer` in `md`. If there are multiple `Question` or `Answer` sections, the function will return only the first one it finds.","status":200,"tokens":[0,304],"elapsed":2.938886189,"_type":"aimessage"}]
