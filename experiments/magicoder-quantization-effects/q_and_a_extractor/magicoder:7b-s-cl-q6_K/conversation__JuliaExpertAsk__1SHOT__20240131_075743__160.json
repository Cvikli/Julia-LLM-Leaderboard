Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution using regular expressions:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = re.findall(r'# Question(.*?)(?=^# Answer|\\Z)', md, re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE)\n    answer = re.findall(r'# Answer(.*?)(?=\\n\\n|$)', md, re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE)\n    \n    # Remove leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text\n    question = [re.sub(r'\\A[\\s\\n]*', '', q).strip() for q in question]\n    answer = [re.sub(r'\\A[\\s\\n]*', '', a).strip() for a in answer]\n    \n    return (question,answer)\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to match the sections of text that start with `# Question` and `# Answer`. The `re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE` flags are used to make `.` match any character including newline (`\\n`), and `^` and `$` match the start and end of a line respectively, not just the string.\n\nThe extracted text is then processed with `strip()` to remove leading spaces and newlines, and with list comprehension to apply this operation to all elements in the lists returned by `re.findall()`.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that each `# Question` section is followed by exactly one `# Answer`, and vice versa. If there can be multiple sections of either type, or if they are not always directly adjacent, you would need a more complex approach to handle these cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,370],"elapsed":3.554956573,"_type":"aimessage"}]
