Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

The `re.DOTALL` flag allows `.` to match newline characters, and `re.MULTILINE` allows `^` and `$` to match the start/end of each line (not just the whole string).\n\nPlease note that this function assumes there is exactly one `# Question` and `# Answer` in your markdown text. If there are multiple questions or answers, you may want to modify the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,253],"elapsed":2.406673333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
