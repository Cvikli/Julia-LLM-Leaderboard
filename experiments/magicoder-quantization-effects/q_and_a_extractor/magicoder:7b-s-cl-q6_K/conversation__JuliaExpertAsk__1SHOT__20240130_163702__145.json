Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can define this function using Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    # Find all sections that start with `# Question` or `# Answer`\n    pattern = r'\\n(# (Question|Answer))\\n(.*?)(?=\\n\\n|\\Z)'\n    matches = re.findall(pattern, md, re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE)\n    \n    # Extract text in each section and strip leading spaces/newlines\n    question = next((m[2].strip() for m in matches if m[1] == 'Question'), '')\n    answer = next((m[2].strip() for m in matches if m[1] == 'Answer'), '')\n    \n    return (question,answer)\n```\nIn this function, `re.findall` is used to find all sections that start with `# Question` or `# Answer`. The pattern `\\n(# (Question|Answer))\\n(.*?)(?=\\n\\n|\\Z)` matches the section header and captures everything until the next empty line or end of text (`\\Z`). The `re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE` flags allow `.` to match any character including newline, and `(?=\\n\\n|\\Z)` is a lookahead that ensures the matched text ends with an empty line (`\\n\\n`) or end of text (`\\Z`).\n\nThe extracted sections are stripped of leading spaces/newlines using the `strip` method. If no matching section is found, an empty string is returned for that section. The function returns a tuple containing the question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,369],"elapsed":3.588444381,"_type":"aimessage"}]
