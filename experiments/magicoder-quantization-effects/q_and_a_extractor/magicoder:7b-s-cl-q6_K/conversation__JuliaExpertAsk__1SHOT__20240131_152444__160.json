Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

If there are multiple such sections in the markdown, it will only return the first one.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes a simple markdown structure where each question/answer section is separated by two newlines (`\\n\\n`). If your markdown has different formatting or more complex structures, you may need to adjust the regular expressions and/or preprocessing steps accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[128,316],"elapsed":3.066628924,"_type":"aimessage"}]
