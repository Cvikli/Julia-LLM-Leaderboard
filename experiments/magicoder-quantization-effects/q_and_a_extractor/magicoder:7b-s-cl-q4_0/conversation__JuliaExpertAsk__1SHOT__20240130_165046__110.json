Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can achieve this using Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = None\n    answer = None\n    lines = md.split('\\n')\n    \n    for i in range(len(lines)):\n        if lines[i] == '# Question':\n            question = ''\n            for j in range(i+1, len(lines)):\n                line = lines[j].strip()\n                if not line:\n                    break\n                question += line + '\\n'\n            \n        elif lines[i] == '# Answer':\n            answer = ''\n            for j in range(i+1, len(lines)):\n                line = lines[j].strip()\n                if not line:\n                    break\n                answer += line + '\\n'\n    \n    return question.strip(), answer.strip()\n```\n\nThis function splits the markdown text into lines and loops through each line to find the Question and Answer sections. It then appends all subsequent non-empty lines until it encounters a blank one, strips leading/trailing spaces and newlines from the resultant string, and returns the question and answer in a tuple.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the structure of your markdown text remains consistent with these sections, i.e., there is always exactly one '# Question' before an '# Answer'. If the structure can be more complex than that or if the sections don't exist at all, you may need a different approach.","status":200,"tokens":[0,341],"elapsed":2.586029694,"_type":"aimessage"}]
