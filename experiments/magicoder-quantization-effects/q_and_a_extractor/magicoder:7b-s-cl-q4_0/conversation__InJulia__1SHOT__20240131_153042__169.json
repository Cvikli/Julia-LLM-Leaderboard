[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function `q_and_a_extractor` that extracts the question and answer from a markdown-formatted string:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question *= strip(replace(line[14:end], \" \" => \"\"))\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer *= strip(replace(line[12:end], \" \" => \"\"))\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating through each line in the markdown string. If a line starts with \"# Question\", it appends the rest of the line to `question` after removing any leading spaces and newlines. Similarly, if a line starts with \"# Answer\", it appends the rest of the line to `answer`. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is only one question and answer per markdown string. If there are multiple questions or answers in the same markdown string, you would need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,277],"elapsed":2.071141022,"_type":"aimessage"}]
