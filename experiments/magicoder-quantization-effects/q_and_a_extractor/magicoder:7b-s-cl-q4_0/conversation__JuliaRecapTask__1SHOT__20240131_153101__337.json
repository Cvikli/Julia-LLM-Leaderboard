[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of `q_and_a_extractor` function using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestion = false\n    inAnswer = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestion = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inAnswer = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"## \") && !inAnswer\n            inQuestion = false\n        elseif startswith(line, \"## \") && inAnswer\n            inAnswer = false\n        end\n        \n        if inQuestion\n            question *= strip(line[3:end])\n        elseif inAnswer\n            answer *= strip(line[3:end])\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the markdown text into lines and checking each line for the start of a new section. If it is a question or an answer section, it appends to the `question` or `answer` string respectively, stripping leading spaces and newline characters from each line. The `startswith(line, \"## \")` checks if the line starts with \"##\" which denotes subsection in markdown.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that a question and answer sections are separated by other subsections (denoted as \"##\"). If this is not the case for your specific use-case, you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,359],"elapsed":2.7746481,"_type":"aimessage"}]
