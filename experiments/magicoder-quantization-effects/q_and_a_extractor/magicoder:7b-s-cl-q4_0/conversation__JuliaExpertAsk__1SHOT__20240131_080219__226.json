The `re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE` flags are used to make `.` match any character (including a newline) and `^` and `$` match start and end of lines respectively.\n\nThe function then uses `sub` method of Python's built-in `re` module to remove leading spaces and newlines from the matched text, and returns it as a tuple. If no matches are found, the function returns None.","status":200,"tokens":[0,294],"elapsed":2.232085784,"_type":"aimessage"}]
