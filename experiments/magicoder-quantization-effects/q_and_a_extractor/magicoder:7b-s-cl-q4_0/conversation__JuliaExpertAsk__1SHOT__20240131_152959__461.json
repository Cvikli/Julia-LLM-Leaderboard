If a line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it sets the corresponding boolean to true. If a line is not empty and the boolean for that section is true, it appends the last character of the line to the relevant variable (removing any leading spaces). It finally returns the question and answer as a tuple after removing leading spaces from each string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,272],"elapsed":2.03917023,"_type":"aimessage"}]
