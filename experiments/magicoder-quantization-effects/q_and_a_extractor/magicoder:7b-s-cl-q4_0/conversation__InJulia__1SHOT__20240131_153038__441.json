[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can use regular expressions (regex) to extract the question and answer from the markdown formatted text. Here is an example of how this could be done:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Extract the question and answer using regex\n    match = match(r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n# Answer\\n(.*)\", md, dotall=true)\n    \n    if match === nothing\n        return \"No question or answer found.\"\n    end\n    \n    # Strip leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text\n    question = replace(match.captures[1], r\"^[\\s\\n]*(.*)\"se=>\\1)\n    answer = replace(match.captures[2], r\"^[\\s\\n]*(.*)\"se=>\\1)\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by searching the markdown string for a match that starts with `# Question` and ends with `# Answer`. If no such match is found, it returns a message saying \"No question or answer found.\" Otherwise, it extracts the question and answer text, strips leading spaces and newlines from them, and returns them as a tuple.\n\nPlease note: This function assumes that there will be exactly one occurrence of `# Question` and `# Answer` in the markdown string, and that they are not part of any other text. If there could be multiple such sections or if they can appear within another section, this function would need to be modified accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,347],"elapsed":2.618484678,"_type":"aimessage"}]
