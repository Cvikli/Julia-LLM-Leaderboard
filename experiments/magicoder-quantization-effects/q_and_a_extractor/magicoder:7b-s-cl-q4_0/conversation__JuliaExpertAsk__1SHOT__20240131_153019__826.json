If a line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it sets the corresponding boolean variable to true, and continues to the next line. If the current line is inside a question (or answer) section and not empty, it appends the stripped version of the current line to the appropriate string (question or answer).\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that all the text in the `md` variable is correctly formatted as per your given instructions. If there are multiple sections (for example, \"Question\" and \"Answer\") in a single markdown section, you may need to adjust this code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,349],"elapsed":2.62892508,"_type":"aimessage"}]
