[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_question && !isempty(line)\n            question *= lstrip(rstrip(line))\n        elseif in_answer && !isempty(line)\n            answer *= lstrip(rstrip(line))\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function splits the markdown text into lines and then checks each line for the start of a question or an answer. If it finds such a line, it sets the corresponding flag and continues to the next line. If it encounters a non-empty line while in a question or answer section, it appends the line stripped of leading spaces and newlines to either `question` or `answer`.\n\nFor example, if you call this function like so:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nThis is my first question.\n\n# Answer\nHere's an answer for the first question.\n\"\"\"\nq_and_a_extractor(md)\n```\nIt will return `(\"This is my first question.\", \"Here's an answer for the first question.\")`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,369],"elapsed":2.765613189,"_type":"aimessage"}]
