[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can do this using Julia's regular expression matching:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = match(r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n(?=# Answer)\", md, re.I)\n    answer = match(r\"# Answer\\n(.*?)\\n\", md, re.I)\n    \n    if question === nothing || answer === nothing\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Markdown does not contain both 'Question' and 'Answer' sections.\"))\n    end\n\n    return (strip(question.captures[1]), strip(answer.captures[1]))\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses two regular expressions to match the question and answer sections in the markdown text. The `match` function returns a Match object if it finds a match, or nothing if not. We then check that both matches were successful before returning the stripped question and answer as a tuple. \n\nPlease note that this code assumes that there is only one 'Question' section and one 'Answer' section in the markdown text. If there are multiple sections of each type, you may need to adjust the regular expressions or the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,268],"elapsed":2.025752877,"_type":"aimessage"}]
