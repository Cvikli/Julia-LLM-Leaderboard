[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is an example of how you could solve this task using Julia programming language:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String) \n    questions = String[]\n    answers = String[]\n    lines = split(strip(md), \"\\n\")\n    \n    block = nothing\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            block = :Question\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\") \n            block = :Answer\n        elseif block !== nothing\n            push!(block == :Question ? questions : answers, strip(line))\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(questions, \" \") * \"\\n\" * join(answers, \" \")\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the markdown text into lines and iterating through each line. If it encounters a `# Question` or `# Answer`, it starts recording in either `questions` or `answers`. Otherwise, if it is reading a block of either `questions` or `answers`, it strips any leading spaces or newlines from the current line and pushes it into the corresponding list. Finally, it joins all the questions together with a space character in between and appends to the answer block. This way, both the question and the answer are returned as a single string separated by a newline.","status":200,"tokens":[0,299],"elapsed":2.346871432,"_type":"aimessage"}]
