Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

The cleaning removes leading spaces and newlines from each section. \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that there is only one `# Question` or `# Answer` per markdown section. If there are multiple, you might need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,281],"elapsed":2.109634255,"_type":"aimessage"}]
