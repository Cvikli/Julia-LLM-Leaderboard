Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

The `findall` method returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two parts - the header (\"Question\" or \"Answer\") and the corresponding text. The '.*?' matches any character (except for a newline), 0 or more times.\n\nThe function then checks that exactly two matches are found. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\nFinally, it strips leading spaces and newlines from both the question and answer using the `lstrip` method and returns them as a tuple.\n\nHere is an example usage:\n```python\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nThis is my question? \n  \n# Answer\nThis is my answer!\n\"\"\"\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(md)) # Outputs ('This is my question?', 'This is my answer!')\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,352],"elapsed":2.690069812,"_type":"aimessage"}]
