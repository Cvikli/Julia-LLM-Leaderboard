[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can write this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if in_question && !isempty(strip(line))\n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif in_answer && !isempty(strip(line))\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function splits the input markdown string into lines and iterates over each line. If a line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it sets the corresponding flag to true and continues to the next line. If a line is not empty and the question or answer flags are set, it appends the stripped line to the respective variable. After going through all lines, it returns the extracted question and answer as a tuple.\n\nNote: This function assumes that each section (question and answer) ends with another section heading or the end of the markdown string. If there could be other sections mixed in between the question and answer, you would need to adjust this code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,334],"elapsed":2.532626951,"_type":"aimessage"}]
