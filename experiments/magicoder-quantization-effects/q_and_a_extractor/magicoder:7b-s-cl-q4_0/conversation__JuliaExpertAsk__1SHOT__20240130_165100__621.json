Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

If a line starts with `# Question`, it adds the rest of that line to `question`. If a line starts with `# Answer`, it adds the rest of that line to `answer`. It then returns the question and answer stripped of leading spaces and newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,208],"elapsed":1.585171283,"_type":"aimessage"}]
