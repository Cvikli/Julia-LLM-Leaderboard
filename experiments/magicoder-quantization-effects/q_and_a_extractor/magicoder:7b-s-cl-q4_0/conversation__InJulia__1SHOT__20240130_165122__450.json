[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple implementation of the function `q_and_a_extractor`:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line,\"# Question\")\n            question *= line[12:end]\n        elseif startswith(line,\"# Answer\")\n            answer *= line[10:end]\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nIn the function, we split the markdown text by newline character and iterate over each line. If a line starts with `# Question`, we add the rest of the line to the `question` string. Similarly, if it starts with `# Answer`, we add the rest of the line to the `answer` string. The `strip` function is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from the text.\n\nThis assumes that your markdown text is formatted consistently as in the example: \n```markdown\n# Question\nHow old are you?\n# Answer\nI am 20 years old.\n```\nIf there could be different indentation levels before `# Question` and `# Answer`, we would have to adjust our function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,294],"elapsed":2.217176755,"_type":"aimessage"}]
