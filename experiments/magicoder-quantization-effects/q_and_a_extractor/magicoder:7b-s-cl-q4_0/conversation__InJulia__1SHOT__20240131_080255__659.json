[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can accomplish this task using Julia's regular expression capabilities:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = match(r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n*?# Answer\", md, re.I).captures[1]\n    answer = match(r\"# Answer\\n(.*?)\\n*?(?=#|$)\", md, re.I).captures[1]\n    \n    # Remove leading spaces and newlines\n    question = replace(question, r\"^[\\s\\n]*\" => \"\")\n    answer = replace(answer, r\"^[\\s\\n]*\" => \"\")\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to match the text between `# Question` and `# Answer`. The `re.I` flag makes the matching case-insensitive. It then removes any leading spaces or newlines from both the question and the answer using the `replace()` function with a regular expression that matches any number of spaces at the start of the string (`^[\\s\\n]*`).\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that there is only one `# Question` and `# Answer` in the markdown text. If there are multiple sections, you may want to adjust the regular expressions accordingly or use a different approach altogether.","status":200,"tokens":[0,299],"elapsed":2.255924778,"_type":"aimessage"}]
