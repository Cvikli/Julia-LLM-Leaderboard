Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple Python solution using regular expressions:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    pattern = r'# Question(.*?)(?=^# Answer|^$|\\Z)'\n    match = re.search(pattern, md, re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE)\n    if match:\n        question = match.group(1).strip()\n    else:\n        question = \"\"\n    \n    pattern = r'# Answer(.*?)(?=^# Question|^$|\\Z)'\n    match = re.search(pattern, md, re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE)\n    if match:\n        answer = match.group(1).strip()\n    else:\n        answer = \"\"\n    \n    return (question, answer)\n```\n\nThis function works by using regular expressions to search for the sections of text that start with \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\". The `re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE` flags are used to make \".\" match any character including newline, and \"^\" and \"$\" to match start/end of a line respectively.\n\nThe extracted text is then stripped of leading spaces and newlines using the `.strip()` method. If no matching section is found for either question or answer, an empty string is returned for that part. The function finally returns a tuple containing the question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,315],"elapsed":2.368246971,"_type":"aimessage"}]
