[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple function that will do this:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\") \n            question *= line[13:end] # skip first 12 characters (assuming it's \"# Question\")\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer *= line[11:end]   # skip first 11 characters (assuming it's \"# Answer\")\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function splits the markdown string into an array of lines, then iterates over each line. If a line starts with `\"# Question\"` or `\"# Answer\"`, it concatenates to `question` or `answer` variable respectively. Then it trims any leading spaces and newlines from these strings using Julia's built-in `strip()` function.\n\nPlease note that this assumes that the question and answer are on the same line as `# Question/Answer` tag, which is usually not the case in markdown files. A more robust solution would involve identifying the lines of text following `# Question/Answer`, not just the tags.","status":200,"tokens":[0,302],"elapsed":2.293400582,"_type":"aimessage"}]
