Here's an example solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    # Find lines starting with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\"\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question_section = false\n    in_answer_section = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \" # Question \")\n            in_question_section = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \" # Answer \")\n            in_answer_section = true\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if in_question_section\n            question *= line[13:end]  # Extract the text after \"# Question \"\n        end\n\n        if in_answer_section\n            answer *= line[10:end]    # Extract the text after \"# Answer \"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Strip leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text\n    question = replace(question, \"\\n\" => \"\")\n    question = ltrim(question)\n    answer = replace(answer, \"\\n\" => \"\")\n    answer = ltrim(answer)\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function splits the markdown text into lines and checks each line for a \"# Question \" or \"# Answer \" prefix. When it finds one of these, it sets a flag to indicate which section it's currently in and skips over that part. It then continues to collect the rest of the line for that section (after stripping off the prefix), concatenating all text into the question and answer variables. After it has collected all lines, it removes leading spaces and newlines from the question and answer strings before returning them in a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,421],"elapsed":3.262332668,"_type":"aimessage"}]
