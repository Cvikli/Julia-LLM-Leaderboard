[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function that does this:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestion = false\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestion = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inQuestion = false\n        elseif inQuestion && !isempty(line)\n            question *= lstrip(rstrip(line))\n        elseif !inQuestion && !isempty(line)\n            answer *= lstrip(rstrip(line))\n        end\n    end\n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function splits the markdown string into lines and iterates over each line. If a line starts with \"# Question\", it sets `inQuestion` to true and continues reading until it encounters a line starting with \"# Answer\". Any non-empty lines that are encountered when `inQuestion` is true are appended to `question`, and any non-empty lines that are encountered when `inQuestion` is false are appended to `answer`. The function then returns the question and answer as a tuple.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is your name?\n\n# Answer\nMy name is Julia.\n\"\"\"\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md)) # prints (\"What is your name?\", \"My name is Julia.\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,350],"elapsed":2.748200421,"_type":"aimessage"}]
