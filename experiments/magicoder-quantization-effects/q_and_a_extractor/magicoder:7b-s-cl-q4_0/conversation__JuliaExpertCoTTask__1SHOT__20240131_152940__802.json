If it encounters a line that says '# Question', it starts collecting question lines. If it encounters a line that says '# Answer', it starts collecting answer lines. Any other line is either part of the question or the answer, depending on which section you're currently in. The function returns the question and answer as tuples after joining them with spaces.\n\nThis script assumes that there will be exactly one 'Answer' header following each 'Question' header and that each section (question and answer) will end with a new line. If your markdown text can have multiple sections per page, or if it can contain other headers besides 'Question' and 'Answer', you would need to adjust the script accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,448],"elapsed":3.417733825,"_type":"aimessage"}]
