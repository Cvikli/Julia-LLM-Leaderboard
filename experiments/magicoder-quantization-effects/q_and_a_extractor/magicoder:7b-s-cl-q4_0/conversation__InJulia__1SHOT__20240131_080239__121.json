[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_question && !isempty(strip(line))\n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif in_answer && !isempty(strip(line))\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the markdown text into lines and then iterating over each line. If a line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it sets the corresponding boolean to true and continues to the next line. If a line is not empty and is within a question or an answer section, it appends the stripped line to the appropriate string (question or answer). Finally, it returns a tuple of the extracted question and answer text.","status":200,"tokens":[98,288],"elapsed":2.202717597,"_type":"aimessage"}]
