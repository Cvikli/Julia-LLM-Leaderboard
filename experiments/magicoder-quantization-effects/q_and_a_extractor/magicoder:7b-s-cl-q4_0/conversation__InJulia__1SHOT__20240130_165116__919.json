If it finds a question section and encounters a line that is not code block (````), it will append the content to the `question`. Same applies to answer section. \n\nThe `replace(line, r\"^[ ]+\", \"\")` part will remove any leading spaces in the lines.\n\nUsage of this function:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\n    This is a question?\n\nThis is not part of the question.\n\n# Answer \n    This is an answer.\n  \n  This is also part of the answer.\n\"\"\"\n\n@show q_and_a_extractor(md) # outputs (\"This is a question?\\nThis is not part of the question.\", \"This is an answer.\\nThis is also part of the answer.\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,423],"elapsed":3.219333797,"_type":"aimessage"}]
