If it does, it appends the rest of the line to `question` or `answer`, respectively. The `strip()` function is used to remove any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n    # Question\n        What is your name?\n    # Answer\n        My name is Julia.\n\"\"\"\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md))  # outputs (\"What is your name?\", \"My name is Julia.\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,298],"elapsed":2.230677754,"_type":"aimessage"}]
