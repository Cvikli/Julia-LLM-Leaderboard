[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you can implement this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Split the markdown into sections\n    sections = split(md, \"# \")\n    \n    # Extract the question and answer text\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    for section in sections\n        if startswith(section, \"Question\")\n            question = section[14:end]\n        elseif startswith(section, \"Answer\")\n            answer = section[10:end]\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Strip leading spaces and newlines from the text\n    question = replace(question, r\"^[ \\t]*\\n\" => \"\")\n    answer = replace(answer, r\"^[ \\t]*\\n\" => \"\")\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the markdown into sections based on the \"# \" prefix. Then it iterates through these sections to find the question and answer text. It checks if a section starts with \"Question\" or \"Answer\", and if so, assigns that section's content to either the `question` or `answer`. Finally, it strips any leading spaces or newlines from the extracted text.\n\nKeep in mind this function assumes your markdown follows the standard format of starting sections with \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\". If this is not the case, you may need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,330],"elapsed":2.478926311,"_type":"aimessage"}]
