The `.*?` part of the pattern is a lazy quantifier that matches as few characters as possible. The `re.DOTALL` flag is used to make the dot in the pattern match any character, including newlines.\n\nThe function then splits the matched section into two parts using '#' as separator and removes leading spaces and newlines from both sections before returning them in a tuple. If no matches are found, an empty string is returned for either question or answer.","status":200,"tokens":[128,297],"elapsed":2.277182591,"_type":"aimessage"}]
