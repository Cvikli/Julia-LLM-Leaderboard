Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution using regular expressions:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = re.findall(r'# Question(.+?)# Answer', md, re.DOTALL)\n    answer = re.findall(r'# Answer(.+?)$', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    if len(question) > 0:\n        question = ' '.join(question[0].split())\n    else:\n        question = ''\n        \n    if len(answer) > 0:\n        answer = ' '.join(answer[0].split())\n    else:\n        answer = ''\n    \n    return (question, answer)\n```\nThis function works by first using the `re.findall` method to find all occurrences of the strings `# Question` and `# Answer`, followed by `.+?` which matches any character (except for a newline), until it reaches the next `#`. The `re.DOTALL` flag is used to make the dot in the regular expression match any character, including newlines.\n\nThen it splits each found string on whitespace and joins them back together with single spaces between words to remove extra spaces. If no matching strings are found for either question or answer, an empty string is returned instead.","status":200,"tokens":[0,293],"elapsed":2.233531898,"_type":"aimessage"}]
