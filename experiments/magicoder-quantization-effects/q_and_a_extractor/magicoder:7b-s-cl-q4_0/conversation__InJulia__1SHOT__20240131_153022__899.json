It then reads until it encounters another section header, removing leading spaces and newlines. The extracted text is stored in a variable (`question` or `answer`) and returned as a tuple once all sections have been read.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes the markdown file ends with either `# Question` or `# Answer`. If it doesn't, you might need to add additional checks for EOF (End of File).","status":200,"tokens":[98,382],"elapsed":2.897254316,"_type":"aimessage"}]
