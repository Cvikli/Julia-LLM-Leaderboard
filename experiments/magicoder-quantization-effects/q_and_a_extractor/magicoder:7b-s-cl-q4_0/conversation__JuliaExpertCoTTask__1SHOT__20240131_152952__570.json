Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Python function that uses regular expressions to extract the question and answer from the markdown text:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    pattern = r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n# Answer\\n(.*?)(?=\\n#|\\Z)\"\n    match = re.search(pattern, md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    if match:\n        question = match.group(1).strip()\n        answer = match.group(2).strip()\n        \n        return (question, answer)\n    else:\n        return None\n```\nThis function first compiles a regular expression pattern that matches the question and answer sections in the markdown text. The `.*?` part of the pattern is a non-greedy match for any characters (except for newline), and `(?=\\n#|\\Z)` is a lookahead assertion to make sure we stop at the next section or end of the string.\n\nThe function then searches the markdown text using this pattern, and if it finds a match, it extracts the question and answer text from the groups in the match object, strips any leading spaces and newlines, and returns them as a tuple. If there is no match (i.e., the input string does not appear to be a properly formatted markdown question-and-answer), the function returns `None`.\n\nFor example:\n```python\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n\\n# Answer\\nThe capital of France is Paris.\\n\"))\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,355],"elapsed":2.697828218,"_type":"aimessage"}]
