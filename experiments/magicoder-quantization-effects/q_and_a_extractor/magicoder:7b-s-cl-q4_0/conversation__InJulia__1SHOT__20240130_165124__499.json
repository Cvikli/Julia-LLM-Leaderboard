Here is a simple solution written in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question *= line[13:end] # strip '# Question' from the start of each subsequent line until the next line starting with '# Answer'\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\") \n            answer *= line[12:end]  # strip '# Answer' from the start of each subsequent line until the end of markdown\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer)) \nend\n```\n\nNote that this function assumes that the markdown always starts with a `# Question` and ends with a `# Answer`. If this is not the case, additional error checking may be necessary.\nAlso note that `strip()` function removes leading spaces and newlines from the text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,263],"elapsed":1.993013157,"_type":"aimessage"}]
