Then it goes through each line one by one, checking if it is a start of Question or Answer section and sets `in_question` and `in_answer` accordingly. It also checks if the line contains any non-empty characters (so it doesn't add empty lines to the question/answer) and appends them to the `question` or `answer`.\n\nTo test this function you could use something like:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nThis is my question. \n\nSome more detail about the question. \n# Answer\nHere is the answer to the question. \n\nMore details about the answer. \n\"\"\"\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md)) # should print (\"This is my question.\\nSome more detail about the question.\", \"Here is the answer to the question.\\nMore details about the answer.\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,435],"elapsed":4.878075277,"_type":"aimessage"}]
