Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution using the `re` module to parse the markdown:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = re.findall(r'\\n# Question(.+?)# Answer', md, re.DOTALL)\n    answer = re.findall(r'# Answer(.+?)\\n\\n', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    return (question[0].strip(), answer[0].strip()) if question and answer else None\n```\nThis function uses regex to find the text between `# Question` and `# Answer` as the `question` and also extracts the text after `# Answer` as the `answer`. The `.+?` part means \"match any character (.) one or more times (?), non-greedy\". This ensures that only the first question and answer are returned.\n\nThe `re.DOTALL` flag allows `.` to match any character, including newline. Without this flag, `.` would not match a newline character, so the `# Answer` tag would not be detected correctly.\n\nIf there is no question or answer in the text, the function will return None. This ensures that the function always returns a tuple, even if there are no questions or answers in the markdown text.","status":200,"tokens":[128,287],"elapsed":3.234829219,"_type":"aimessage"}]
