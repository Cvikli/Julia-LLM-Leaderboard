[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can achieve this:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    \n    question_started = false\n    question = \"\"\n    answer_started = false\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question_started = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if question_started && !startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            question *= strip(line[2:end])\n        elseif answer_started\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    \n        if startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            question_started = false\n            answer_started = true\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function splits the markdown string into lines and goes through each line. If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\", it starts adding text to `question`. If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Answer\", it stops adding text to `question` (if any) and start adding text to `answer`. After extracting the question and answer, the function returns them in a tuple. \n\nPlease make sure your input markdown format adheres to the guidelines. It's always recommended to have well-formatted, clean Markdown files as input for this kind of processing.","status":200,"tokens":[0,339],"elapsed":3.784487765,"_type":"aimessage"}]
