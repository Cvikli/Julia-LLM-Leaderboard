Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

If it encounters a line starting with '# Answer', it stops looking for the question. It also ignores lines that start with '#'. If it finds a line starting with '# Question', it starts recording the question. If it is already in the middle of recording a question, it continues to record it by adding any subsequent lines to the question variable.\n\nPlease note that this function does not handle cases where there might be nested sections like '## Sub-question'. You can extend this function to handle such cases if needed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,309],"elapsed":3.457960042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
