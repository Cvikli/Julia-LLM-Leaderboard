[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

Here's an example of how you could solve this problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    doc = parse(md)\n\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestion = false\n    inAnswer = false\n    \n    for block in eachblock(doc)\n        if isa(block, Markdown.HeaderBlock) && block.level == 1\n            if startswith(block.content[1], \"Question\")\n                inQuestion = true\n            elseif startswith(block.content[1], \"Answer\")\n                inAnswer = true\n            end\n        elseif isa(block, Markdown.ParagraphBlock) && (inQuestion || inAnswer)\n            text = join([inner_html(x) for x in block.content])\n            if inQuestion\n                question *= strip(text)\n            else\n                answer *= strip(text)\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each block of the markdown document. It checks if a block is a header block (which are typically used to start new sections in markdown). If it's a header and it starts with \"Question\" or \"Answer\", then it sets a flag for that section (inQuestion for Question, inAnswer for Answer) and continues on until the next header. If it's a paragraph block and one of the flags is set, it adds to the corresponding text variable after stripping leading spaces and newlines.\n\nFor example, if `md` was:\n```markdown\n# Question\nWhat is your name?\n\n# Answer\nMy name is Julia.\n```\nThen calling `q_and_a_extractor(md)` would return `(\"What is your name?\",\"My name is Julia.\")`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,456],"elapsed":5.269609664,"_type":"aimessage"}]
