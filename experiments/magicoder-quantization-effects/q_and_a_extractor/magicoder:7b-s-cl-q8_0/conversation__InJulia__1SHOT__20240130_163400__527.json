If a line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it sets the corresponding variable to `true` and continues to the next line. Otherwise, if both variables are set and the line is not empty, it strips any leading spaces and adds the text to the appropriate variable. Finally, it returns the extracted question and answer as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,317],"elapsed":3.538530803,"_type":"aimessage"}]
