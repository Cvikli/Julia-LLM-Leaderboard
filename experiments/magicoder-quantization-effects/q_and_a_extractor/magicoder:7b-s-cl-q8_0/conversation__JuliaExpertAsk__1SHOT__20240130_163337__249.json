Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution using regular expressions:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = re.search(r'# Question(.*?)# Answer', md, re.DOTALL)\n    answer = re.search(r'# Answer(.*)', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    if question:\n        q = question.group(1).strip()\n    else:\n        q = None\n        \n    if answer:\n        a = answer.group(1).strip()\n    else:\n        a = None\n    \n    return (q, a)\n```\nThis function works by first using the `re` module to search for the question and answer sections in the markdown text. The `re.DOTALL` flag means that `.` will match any character including newlines. If either section is not found, it returns `None`. Then it strips leading spaces and newlines from each extracted section using the `strip()` method.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use this function:\n\n```python\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question \n\nThis is a long question that goes on for several lines. It may even contain code blocks or other markdown syntax.\n\n# Answer\n\nThe answer to the question above is simple, but can be quite lengthy as well. It might also contain code snippets too!\n\"\"\"\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(md))  # outputs: ('This is a long question that goes on for several lines.
