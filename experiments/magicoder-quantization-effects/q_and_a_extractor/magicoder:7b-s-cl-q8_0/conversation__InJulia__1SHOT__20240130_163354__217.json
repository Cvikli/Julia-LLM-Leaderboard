[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, Here is an example of such function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    \n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    readingQuestionSection = false\n    readingAnswerSection = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if line == \"# Question\"\n            readingQuestionSection = true\n        elseif line == \"# Answer\"\n            readingAnswerSection = true\n        elseif readingQuestionSection && line[1] != '#' \n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif readingAnswerSection && line[1] != '#'\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the markdown string into lines and scanning each line. When it encounters \"# Question\", it starts recording text until it sees another \"#\". It does similar thing for \"Answer\" section. The `strip` function is used to remove any leading spaces or newlines from the extracted text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,245],"elapsed":2.733457517,"_type":"aimessage"}]
