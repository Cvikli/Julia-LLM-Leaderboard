Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution:\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = re.findall('(?<=# Question\\n).*', md, re.DOTALL)[0].strip()\n    answer = re.findall('(?<=# Answer\\n).*', md, re.DOTALL)[0].strip()\n    return (question,answer)\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions (`re` module in Python) to find the text between `# Question` and `# Answer`. The `re.findall()` function returns all non-overlapping matches of pattern in string as a list of strings. The `re.DOTALL` flag tells the regex engine that `.` should match any character including newline (`\\n`).\nThe strip() method is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,193],"elapsed":2.168052955,"_type":"aimessage"}]
