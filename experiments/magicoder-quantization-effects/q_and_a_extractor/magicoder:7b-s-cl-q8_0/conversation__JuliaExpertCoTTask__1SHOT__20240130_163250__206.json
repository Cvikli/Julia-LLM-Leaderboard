Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a solution using Python's built-in `re` module for regular expressions to parse the markdown:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = None\n    answer = None\n\n    lines = md.split('\\n')\n    current = None\n    \n    for line in lines:\n        match = re.match(r'# (Question|Answer)', line)\n        \n        if match:\n            current = match.group(1).lower()\n            continue\n\n        if current == 'question':\n            question = line.lstrip(' ')\n\n        elif current == 'answer':\n            answer = line.lstrip(' ')\n\n    return (question, answer)\n```\n\nThis function works by first splitting the markdown string into lines and then iterating over each line. For every line, it checks if the line matches a \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If so, it sets the current section to either \"question\" or \"answer\", skipping further processing on that line. \n\nIf the current section is \"question\", it stores the question text in the `question` variable. If it's \"answer\", it stores the answer text in the `answer` variable. After iterating over all lines, it returns a tuple of the question and answer text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,297],"elapsed":3.341673176,"_type":"aimessage"}]
