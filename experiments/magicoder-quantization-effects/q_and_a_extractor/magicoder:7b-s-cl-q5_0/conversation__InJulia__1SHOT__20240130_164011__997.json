[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example implementation of `q_and_a_extractor` function using Julia's regular expression module:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = matchall(r\"# Question(.*?)(?=# Answer)\", md, capture=true).strip\n    answer = matchall(r\"# Answer(.*?)\", md, capture=true)[1].strip\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nIn the above function, `matchall` is a helper function to extract all matches of a regular expression. The pattern `\"# Question(.*?)(?=# Answer)\"` looks for all text following `# Question`, while the pattern `\"# Answer(.*?)\"` looks for all text following `# Answer`. The `.strip` method is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text. \n\nThis function assumes that there will only be one question followed by answer section in your markdown text. If you have multiple questions/answers, or if a question might not have an associated answer (e.g., it's just asking for clarification), you would need to adjust the regular expression and possibly add error handling code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,261],"elapsed":2.246081432,"_type":"aimessage"}]
