[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Below is a simple solution that uses the `eachline` function to iterate through each line of the markdown string. It also makes use of the `startswith` method to check if the line starts with \"Question\" or \"Answer\", and then appends the rest of the line (after stripping any leading spaces and newlines) to the corresponding list, which is returned as a tuple at the end.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question = []\n    answer = []\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    for line in lines\n        stripped = strip(line)\n        if startswith(stripped, \"# Question\")\n            push!(question, stripped[14:end])\n        elseif startswith(stripped, \"# Answer\")\n            push!(answer, stripped[10:end])\n        end\n    end\n    return (join(question, \"\"), join(answer, \"\"))\nend\n```\nPlease note that this assumes each question and answer are separated by a single line with the appropriate section heading. If questions or answers can span multiple lines or are nested under other headings, more complex parsing would be needed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,271],"elapsed":2.37862477,"_type":"aimessage"}]
