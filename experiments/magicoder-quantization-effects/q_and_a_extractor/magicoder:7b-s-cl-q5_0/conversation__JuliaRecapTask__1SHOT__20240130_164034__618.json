[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution using Julia's regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    m = match(r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n# Answer\\n(.*)\", md, re.MULTILINE | re.DOTALL)\n    if m == nothing \n        return (\"No question or answer found\", \"\")\n    end\n    question = strip(m[1])\n    answer   = strip(m[2])\n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `match` function of Julia's regular expressions module (`re`) to search for text between `# Question\\n` and `\\n# Answer`. The `re.MULTILINE | re.DOTALL` flags ensure that the `.` in the pattern matches any character, including newlines. The `strip` function removes leading spaces and newlines from the question and answer strings.\n\nThis is a basic implementation. If your markdown file includes more complex sections or has varying formats (e.g., different number of leading whitespaces), you may need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,253],"elapsed":2.238762084,"_type":"aimessage"}]
