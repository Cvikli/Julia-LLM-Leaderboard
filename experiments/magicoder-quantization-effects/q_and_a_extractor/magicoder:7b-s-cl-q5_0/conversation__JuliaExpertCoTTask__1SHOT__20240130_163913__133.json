Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use the `re` module in python to extract the required sections from the markdown text and then strip any leading spaces and newlines. The code below accomplishes this:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = re.search('(?<=# Question\\n).*?(?=\\n# Answer)', md, re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE)\n    answer = re.search('(?<=# Answer\\n).*', md, re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE)\n    \n    if question and answer:\n        return (question.group(0).strip(), answer.group(0).strip())\n    else:\n        return (\"No Question or Answer found\", \"\")\n\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n# Answer\\nThe capital of France is Paris.\"))\n```\nThis code first finds a match for text between \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\". The `re.DOTALL` flag allows `.*` to span multiple lines and `re.MULTILINE` allows `^` and `$` to match at the start/end of each line. If matches are found, they are stripped of leading whitespaces using the `strip()` method.\n\nIf no match is found, it returns a tuple with an appropriate error message.","status":200,"tokens":[0,311],"elapsed":2.710942378,"_type":"aimessage"}]
