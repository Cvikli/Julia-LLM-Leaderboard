Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

The `re.DOTALL` flag makes `.` match any character, including newlines, which is necessary for multi-line matches. The function then strips any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text using the `strip()` method.\n\nThe question and answer are returned as a tuple `(question,answer)`. If no matches were found, it will return None.","status":200,"tokens":[0,232],"elapsed":1.983472876,"_type":"aimessage"}]
