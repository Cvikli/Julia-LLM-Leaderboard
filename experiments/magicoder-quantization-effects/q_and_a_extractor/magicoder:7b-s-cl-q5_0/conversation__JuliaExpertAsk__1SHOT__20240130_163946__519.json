Then it iterates through each line. If the line is \"# Question\", it changes the mode to 1. Similarly, if the line is \"# Answer\", it changes the mode to 2. For all other lines, it appends the stripped version of the line (after removing leading spaces and newlines) to either the question or answer based on the current mode. At the end, it returns a tuple with the extracted question and answer text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,300],"elapsed":2.571788266,"_type":"aimessage"}]
