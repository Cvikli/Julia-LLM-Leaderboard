If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\", it sets `in_question` to true and `in_answer` to false, effectively indicating that we are currently processing a question section. Similarly, if it encounters a line that starts with \"# Answer\", it sets `in_question` to false and `in_answer` to true.\n\nIf the current line is in a question section (`in_question == true`), it appends the stripped content of the line to the `question` variable. If the current line is in an answer section (`in_answer == true`), it appends the stripped content of the line to the `answer` variable.\n\nFinally, it returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,385],"elapsed":6.655264678,"_type":"aimessage"}]
