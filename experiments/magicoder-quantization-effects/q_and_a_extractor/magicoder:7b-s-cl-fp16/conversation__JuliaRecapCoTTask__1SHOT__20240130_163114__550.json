[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is a simple implementation of the task using the `eachline` function to iterate through each line of the markdown file, and `strip` method to remove leading spaces and newline characters.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)::Tuple{String, String}\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestionSection = false \n    inAnswerSection = false\n    \n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestionSection = true\n            inAnswerSection = false\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inAnswerSection = true\n            inQuestionSection = false\n        elseif inQuestionSection \n            question *= line.strip()\n        elseif inAnswerSection\n            answer *= line.strip()\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nThis function assumes that the `# Question` and `# Answer` lines are on separate lines with no leading spaces or newlines. The `startswith` function is used to check if a line starts with either `\"# Question\"` or `\"# Answer\"`, and the `*=` operator is used to append the stripped line (without any leading spaces or newline characters) to the question or answer string.\n\nPlease note that this is a basic implementation and may not cover all edge cases in your markdown files. For example, it doesn't handle nested sections or other complex markdown structures. You might need to adjust the solution based on how your markdown files are formatted.","status":200,"tokens":[0,350],"elapsed":6.198723957,"_type":"aimessage"}]
