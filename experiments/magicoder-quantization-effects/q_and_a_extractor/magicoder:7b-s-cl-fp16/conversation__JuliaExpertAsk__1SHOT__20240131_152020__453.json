The `^` symbol is used to denote the start of a line, and `.` matches any character except newline. The `*` quantifier means \"zero or more of the preceding element\". \n\nThe `re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE` flags are used to make dot match all characters (including newlines) and to make `^` match both the start of a string and the start of each line, respectively.\n\nIf there is no question or answer in the input markdown text, it returns None. Otherwise, it strips any leading spaces and newline from the extracted texts using `re.sub('\\s+', ' ', ...)`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,315],"elapsed":5.450194198,"_type":"aimessage"}]
