[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible solution using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_text(md)\n    lines = split(strip(md), \"\\n\")\n    q_and_a = Dict(\"Question\" => [], \"Answer\" => [])\n\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n        end\n        \n        if in_question && !isempty(line) && !startswith(line, \" \")\n            question *= line[2:end] * \"\\n\"\n        elseif in_answer && !isempty(line) && !startswith(line, \" \")\n            answer *= line[2:end] * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the markdown text into lines and checking each line to see whether it's part of a question or an answer. If a line is starting with `#` symbol, we can identify that as the start of the Question or Answer section. We then append all subsequent non-empty lines (after stripping any leading spaces) to the current section until we encounter another section.\n\nYou can call this function like so: `extract_text(md)`. It will return a tuple containing the question and answer text, with any leading/trailing whitespace removed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,364],"elapsed":6.423313326,"_type":"aimessage"}]
