If it encounters a line starting with `# Question`, it sets `in_question` to true, ignores that line, and continues to the next one. Similarly for `# Answer`. When it finds a line that is not indented (i.e., does not start with a space), it appends the text of that line to the current section (question or answer). Finally, it returns the question and answer stripped of leading spaces and newlines.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no other sections in your markdown file starting with `#`. If there are, you might want to adjust this code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,358],"elapsed":6.180157961,"_type":"aimessage"}]
