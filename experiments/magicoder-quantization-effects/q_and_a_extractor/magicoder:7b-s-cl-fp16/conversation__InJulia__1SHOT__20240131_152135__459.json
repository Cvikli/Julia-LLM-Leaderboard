Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

If it is, it extracts the text without the leading `#` and any spaces afterward. The extracted text is then concatenated to the respective variable (`question` or `answer`).\n\nIt also ignores lines starting with ``` as they might contain code blocks that should not be considered as part of the question/answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,299],"elapsed":5.175017951,"_type":"aimessage"}]
