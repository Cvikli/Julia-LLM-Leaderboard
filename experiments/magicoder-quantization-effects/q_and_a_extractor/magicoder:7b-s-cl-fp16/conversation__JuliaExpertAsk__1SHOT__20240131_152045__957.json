Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might implement this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_question && !isempty(strip(line))\n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif in_answer && !isempty(strip(line))\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the input markdown `md` into lines and iterating over each line. It checks if a line is starting with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If it's true, it changes the corresponding flag to true and continue to next line. If it's not starting with these two strings but within the question section, it adds the stripped content of the line into `question`. Same goes for `answer` variable.\n\nYou can call this function like:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question \nWhat is your name?\n\n# Answer\nJohn Doe\n\"\"\"\n@show q_and_a_extractor(md) # prints (\"What is your name?\", \"John Doe\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,365],"elapsed":6.32210583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
