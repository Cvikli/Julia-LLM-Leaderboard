[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function that will do this:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestion = false\n    inAnswer = false\n    \n    for line in split(md, '\\n')\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestion = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inAnswer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if inQuestion && !startswith(line, \" \")\n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif inAnswer && !startswith(line, \" \")\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nThe function works by iterating over each line of the input string. If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\", it sets `inQuestion` to true and continues to the next line. Similarly, if it encounters a line starting with \"# Answer\", it sets `inAnswer` to true and continues to the next line. \n\nIf `inQuestion` is true and the current line does not start with a space (indicating that it's not part of the same paragraph as the previous one), it appends the stripped version of the line to the question string. Similarly, if `inAnswer` is true and the current line does not start with a space, it appends the stripped version of the line to the answer string.\n\nFinally, once all lines have been processed, it returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,366],"elapsed":6.321186788,"_type":"aimessage"}]
