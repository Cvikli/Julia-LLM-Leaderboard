[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestion = false\n    inAnswer = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestion = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inAnswer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if inQuestion && !startswith(line, \" \")\n            question *= line[3:end]\n        end\n        \n        if inAnswer && !startswith(line, \" \")\n            answer *= line[3:end]\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nThis function splits the input markdown string into lines and iterates over each line. If a line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it sets the corresponding flag to true and continues to the next line. If a line does not start with a space (assuming that lines starting with spaces are indented), then it appends the text to the question or answer string, stripping any leading spaces or newlines. Finally, it returns a tuple of the processed question and answer strings. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that your markdown does not have multiple levels of headers (i.e., a line starting with \"# Question\" followed by another line starting with \"## Sub-question\") and does not handle such cases. It also assumes that there are no mixed questions and answers within the same document, as it will only keep track of whether it is currently processing a question or an answer based on the last header it encountered.","status":200,"tokens":[0,397],"elapsed":6.871439463,"_type":"aimessage"}]
