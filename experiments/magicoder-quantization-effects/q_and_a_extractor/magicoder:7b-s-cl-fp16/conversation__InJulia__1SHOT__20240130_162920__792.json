[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can do this using Julia's built-in regular expression module:\n\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    match = collect(eachmatch(r\"(?sm)\\n#\\s*Question(.*?)#\\s*Answer\", md))\n    if isempty(match)  # No matches found, return empty tuple.\n        return ()\n    end\n    question_answer = mapreduce(x -> replace(x, r\"\\n|^\\s*\" => \"\"),\n                                (acc, x) -> acc * \"\\n\" * strip(x), match[1], init=\"\")\n    return question_answer\nend\n```\nIn the above function:\n\n- `(?sm)` - Enable multi-line and dot matches.\n- `.*` - Match any character (except a newline).\n- `(.*?)` - Non-greedy match on filler characters.\n- `^` - Assert position at the start of the string.\n- `\\s*Answer` - Matches zero or more white space characters followed by \"Answer\".\n- `#\\s*` - Matches a hash symbol (`#`) and zero or more white spaces.\n- `collect(eachmatch)` - Collect all non-overlapping matches.\n- `replace(x, r\"\\n|^\\s*\", \"\")` - Replaces newline characters and leading spaces with nothing in the match `x`.\n- `mapreduce` - Reduce a collection by applying a function to each element and accumulating the results. In this case, it strips leading spaces from every line of the extracted text.\n  \nPlease note that the regular expression used here assumes that `# Question` and `# Answer` are on separate lines at the start of their respective sections. If they can be part of a paragraph, additional handling would be needed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,414],"elapsed":7.240609487,"_type":"aimessage"}]
