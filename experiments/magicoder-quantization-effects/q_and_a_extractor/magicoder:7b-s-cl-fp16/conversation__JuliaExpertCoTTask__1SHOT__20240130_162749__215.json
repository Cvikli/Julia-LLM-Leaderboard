If it encounters a line starting with \"# Question\", it starts recording that section as the question, removing leading and trailing spaces. Similarly for the answer section. The function continues capturing until an end marker is encountered or a new start marker is found.","status":200,"tokens":[0,445],"elapsed":7.82837954,"_type":"aimessage"}]
