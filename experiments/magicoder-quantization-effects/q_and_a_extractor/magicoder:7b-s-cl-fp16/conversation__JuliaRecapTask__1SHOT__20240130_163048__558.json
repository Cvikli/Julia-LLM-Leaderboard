[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can use regular expressions to match patterns in strings (also known as regex). Here is how we might implement this task:\n\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    for line in split(md, '\\n')\n        if match(r\"^# Question\", line) !== nothing\n            question *= replace(line[1:end-2], r\"^\\s*\" => \"\") # remove leading spaces and '#'\n        elseif match(r\"^# Answer\", line) !== nothing\n            answer *= replace(line[1:end-2], r\"^\\s*\" => \"\") \n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the markdown text into lines and then checking each line to see if it starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If so, it appends the rest of the line (minus any leading spaces and '#') to either `question` or `answer`.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that a markdown section starting with `# Question` is followed by another section starting with `# Answer`, and both are not nested. If more complex nesting or other variations in the markdown format need to be handled, additional logic would need to be added. \n\nAlso, as it is, this function will include leading spaces of any subsequent lines after a `# Question` or `# Answer` line (since we only remove leading spaces and '#' from the current line). If this needs to be fixed, more complex parsing will be necessary.","status":200,"tokens":[0,361],"elapsed":6.358549543,"_type":"aimessage"}]
