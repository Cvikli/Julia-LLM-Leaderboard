[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could implement this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Split the markdown string into sections based on \"# \"\n    sections = split(md, \"\\n# \")\n    \n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    for section in sections\n        if startswith(section, \"Question\")\n            question = replace(strip(split(section, '\\n')[2]), '\\n', ' ')\n        elseif startswith(section, \"Answer\")\n            answer = replace(strip(split(section, '\\n')[2]), '\\n', ' ')\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the markdown string into sections based on \"# \". Then it iterates over each section and checks if it starts with \"Question\" or \"Answer\". If so, it extracts the text following the \"# \" and strips any leading spaces or newlines. It then stores this extracted text in `question` or `answer`, respectively. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the question and answer.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that each section of markdown starts with exactly one \"# \". If there are multiple sections per line, or if there is more than one \"# \" in a line, this function will not work correctly. You may need to adjust the function accordingly based on your specific requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,317],"elapsed":5.544162666,"_type":"aimessage"}]
