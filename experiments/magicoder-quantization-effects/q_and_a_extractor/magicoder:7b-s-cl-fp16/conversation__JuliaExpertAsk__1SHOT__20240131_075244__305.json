Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

It then strips any leading spaces or newlines from the extracted text. If no question or answer is found, it returns an empty string for that part of the tuple.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there will be at most one question and one answer in the markdown text. If there are multiple questions or answers, only the last ones will be returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,278],"elapsed":4.80666586,"_type":"aimessage"}]
