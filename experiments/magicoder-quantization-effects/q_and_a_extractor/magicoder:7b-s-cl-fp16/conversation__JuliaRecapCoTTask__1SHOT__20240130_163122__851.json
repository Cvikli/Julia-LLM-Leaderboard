[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem, we will use the `eachline` function to read through the markdown line by line, keep track of which section we are in (Question or Answer), and strip leading spaces and newlines. We can use a simple state machine to switch between these sections. Here is a sample code for it:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    section = \"\" # initially empty, then \"Question\" or \"Answer\".\n    \n    lines = split(replace(strip(md), \"\\r\\n\" => \"\\n\"), '\\n') \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            section = \"Question\"\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            section = \"Answer\"\n        elseif section == \"Question\" && !isempty(line)\n            question *= strip(line)  # append to the question string after stripping leading spaces and newlines.\n        elseif section == \"Answer\" && !isempty(line)\n            answer *= strip(line)    # append to the answer string after stripping leading spaces and newlines.\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer) \nend\n```\nIn this function, the `split` function is used to split the markdown by lines, and then for each line, we check whether it starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If it does, we update the `section` variable. Then, if the current section is \"Question\" and the line is not empty (i.e., there's some text following), we append the stripped line to our question string. The same applies for the answer string.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that each `# Question` or `# Answer` markdown is on its own line, and there are no nested questions or answers. If there could be these cases, you would need a more complex state machine or recursive function to handle them correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,446],"elapsed":7.897618359,"_type":"aimessage"}]
