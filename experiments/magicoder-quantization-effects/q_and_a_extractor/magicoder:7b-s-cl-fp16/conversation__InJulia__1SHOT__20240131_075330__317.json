The function `q_and_a_extractor` splits the markdown string into sections based on `# Question` and `# Answer`, then extracts the relevant text for each section. \n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Split the markdown string by lines\n    md_lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    \n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    \n    for line in md_lines\n        if occursin(\"# Question\", line)\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n        elseif occursin(\"# Answer\", line)\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n        end\n        \n        # Extract text for question and answer sections\n        if in_question && !isempty(line)\n            question *= strip(line[2:end])\n        elseif in_answer && !isempty(line)\n            answer *= strip(line[2:end])\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nYou can use this function to extract the question and answer from a markdown string like so:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question \nThis is a sample question.\n\n# Answer\nThis is a sample answer.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: \", question)\nprintln(\"Answer: \", answer)\n```\n\nThis will print:\n\n```julia\nQuestion: This is a sample question.\nAnswer: This is a sample answer.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[98,410],"elapsed":7.110279011,"_type":"aimessage"}]
