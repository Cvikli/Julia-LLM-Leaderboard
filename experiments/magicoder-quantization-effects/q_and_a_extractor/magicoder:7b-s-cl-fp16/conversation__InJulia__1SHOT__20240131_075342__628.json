[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestionSection = false\n    inAnswerSection = false\n\n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestionSection = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inQuestionSection = false\n            inAnswerSection = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if inQuestionSection\n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif inAnswerSection\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each line of the markdown text. If a line starts with \"# Question\", it sets `inQuestionSection` to true and continues to the next line. Similarly, if a line starts with \"# Answer\", it sets `inAnswerSection` to true and continues to the next line. If a line is in either section (i.e., neither section has been started or ended), it appends the stripped version of that line to the appropriate variable (`question` or `answer`).\n\nPlease note, this function assumes that there are no nested sections for Questions and Answers. Also, it does not handle cases where a question or an answer may span multiple lines. You might need to adjust this code based on your specific requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,339],"elapsed":5.863573762,"_type":"aimessage"}]
