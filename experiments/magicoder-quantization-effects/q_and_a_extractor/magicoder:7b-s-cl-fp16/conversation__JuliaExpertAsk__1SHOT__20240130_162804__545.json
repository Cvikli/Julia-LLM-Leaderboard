The `startswith` function checks if a line starts with a certain string (\"# Question\" or \"# Answer\") and the indexing operation extracts the relevant portion of the string. This approach assumes that each `# Question` section is followed by exactly one `# Answer` section, and that there are no other sections (like `# Hint`) that might need to be extracted in future versions of this function.","status":200,"tokens":[128,298],"elapsed":5.203145289,"_type":"aimessage"}]
