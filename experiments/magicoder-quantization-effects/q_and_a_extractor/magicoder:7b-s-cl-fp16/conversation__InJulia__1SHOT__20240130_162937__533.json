[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can do this using regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    m = matchall(r\"(?<=#\\s{1,2})(Question|Answer)(.*?)(?=\\n##)\", md)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    for s in m\n        if contains(\"Question\", s[2])\n            question = strip(s[3])\n        elseif contains(\"Answer\", s[2])\n            answer = strip(s[3])\n        end\n    end\n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `matchall` function from the Markdown.jl package to find all matches of the regular expression pattern in the markdown text. The pattern is set up so that it will match `# Question` or `# Answer`, followed by any characters until it encounters a newline. The matched strings are then stripped of leading spaces and newlines using `strip`. The question and answer are returned as a tuple.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n## Question\nThis is the question part.\n## Answer\nThis is the answer part.\n\"\"\"\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(md)) # should print (\"This is the question part.\", \"This is the answer part.\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,312],"elapsed":5.444156848,"_type":"aimessage"}]
