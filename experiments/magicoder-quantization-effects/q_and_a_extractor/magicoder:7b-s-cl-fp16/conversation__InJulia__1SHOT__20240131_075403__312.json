Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem using Julia's Regex module:\n\n```julia\nusing REGEX\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = matchall(r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n## Answer\", md, 1)\n    answer = matchall(r\"# Answer\\n(.*?)\\n## End\", md, 1)\n    return (strip.(question), strip.(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `matchall` function from REGEX module to find all matches of the given regular expressions in the markdown text. The `r\"...\"` syntax is used to define a regular expression. The `.*?` part of the regex means \"any character (.) any number of times (*), but as few as possible (?). The `\\n` part means newline.\n\nThe `strip` function is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that there will be exactly one question and answer in the markdown text, and that they are separated by a section with \"## End\". If this is not the case, you might need to adjust the regular expressions or the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,268],"elapsed":4.633826886,"_type":"aimessage"}]
