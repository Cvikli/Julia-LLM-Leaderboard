If it encounters a line starting with \"# Question\", it starts recording the question. If it encounters a line starting with \"# Answer\", it stops recording the question and starts recording the answer. It also removes leading spaces and newlines from each recorded section before returning them as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,294],"elapsed":5.079624181,"_type":"aimessage"}]
