It then extracts the text from these sections into two variables, `question` and `answer`, respectively. The extracted text is stripped of leading spaces and newlines before being returned as a tuple.\n\nNote: This function assumes that the markdown file contains exactly one `# Question` section followed immediately by one `# Answer` section. If your markdown files can have multiple sections, you will need to adjust this code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,344],"elapsed":5.959495878,"_type":"aimessage"}]
