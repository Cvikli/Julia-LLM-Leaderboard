Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

The `re.DOTALL` flag allows the dot (.) to match any character at all, including a newline. If there are multiple questions or answers in the markdown, it will return only the last one. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the question and answer sections do not overlap. If they do, you may need to adjust the regular expressions or the logic of the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,296],"elapsed":5.151525929,"_type":"aimessage"}]
