Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution using regular expressions:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = re.findall(r'# Question(.+?)(?=# Answer|$)', md, re.DOTALL)\n    answer = re.findall(r'# Answer(.+?)(?=$)', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # Remove leading spaces and newlines\n    question = [re.sub('\\n',' ', q).strip() for q in question] if question else None\n    answer = [re.sub('\\n',' ', a).strip() for a in answer] if answer else None\n\n    return (question,answer)\n```\nThis function `q_and_a_extractor` will find all the text between `# Question` and `# Answer`, or the end of the string (`$`). It will also strip newlines from the extracted text. The output is a tuple of two lists: one for the questions and another for the answers, both in the same order as they appeared in `md`. If there are no questions or answers, the corresponding list will be `None`.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that each section of Question and Answer appears on its own line (i.e., it does not consider sections separated by other markdown elements). To handle more complex cases where questions and answers can be interleaved with other markdown elements, you'll need a more sophisticated parser or use a library such as `mistune` to parse markdown into an AST (abstract syntax tree) and then traverse the tree.","status":200,"tokens":[0,355],"elapsed":6.146651261,"_type":"aimessage"}]
