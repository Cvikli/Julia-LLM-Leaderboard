[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could implement this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split markdown into sections based on headers\n    sections = split(md, \"# \")\n    \n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    for section in sections\n        if startswith(section, \"Question\")\n            question = strip(split(section, \"\\n\")[2])\n        elseif startswith(section, \"Answer\")\n            answer = strip(split(section, \"\\n\")[2])\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the markdown into sections based on headers. It then loops through these sections and checks if they start with \"Question\" or \"Answer\". If they do, it extracts the text after that section's header and strips any leading spaces or newlines. Finally, it returns a tuple of the question and answer.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that each section (except for the first one) starts on a new line and does not contain any other headers. If your markdown can have different formats, you would need to adjust this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,271],"elapsed":4.742930329,"_type":"aimessage"}]
