It checks if the line starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`, and then appends all subsequent lines to the appropriate list (`question` for the question, `answer` for the answer). \n\nIt also uses a regular expression to exclude lines starting with numbered lists (as these are likely part of the question itself), and strips leading spaces from each line before appending. Finally, it joins all the lines in each list into single strings and returns them as a tuple `(question,answer)`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,331],"elapsed":5.743208449,"_type":"aimessage"}]
