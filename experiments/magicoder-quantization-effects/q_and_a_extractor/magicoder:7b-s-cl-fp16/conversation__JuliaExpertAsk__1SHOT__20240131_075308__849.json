Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution using regular expressions:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = re.findall(r'# Question(.*?)# Answer', md, re.DOTALL)\n    answer = re.findall(r'# Answer(.*?)$', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    if question and answer:  # If both are found\n        return (question[0].strip(), answer[0].strip())\n    else:\n        return None\n```\n\nHere is how it works:\n- `re.findall(r'# Question(.*?)# Answer', md, re.DOTALL)` finds all text between `# Question` and `# Answer`. The `.*?` inside the parentheses makes it non-greedy, so it stops at the first `# Answer` it encounters.\n- `re.findall(r'# Answer(.*?)$', md, re.DOTALL)` does the same for the answer text. `$` matches the end of the string, ensuring that we only get the last `# Answer` in case there are multiple.\n- `.strip()` is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from the extracted texts.\n- If both question and answer are found (i.e., if `question` and `answer` lists aren't empty), it returns a tuple of the question and answer text. Otherwise, it returns None.","status":200,"tokens":[0,318],"elapsed":5.503087459,"_type":"aimessage"}]
