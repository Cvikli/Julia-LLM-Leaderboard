[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple solution using regular expressions to extract the question and answer sections:\n\n```julia\nusing README_checks: readme_check, readme_contents\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer.\n    q_and_a = matchall(r\"(?<=\\n# Question\\n)(.*?)(?=\\n# Answer\\n)\", md)\n    \n    if length(q_and_a) == 2 # If there are exactly two matches, extract the question and answer.\n        q = strip(q_and_a[1])\n        a = strip(q_and_a[2])\n        \n        return (q, a)\n    else\n        error(\"Markdown does not contain both 'Question' and 'Answer' sections.\")\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `matchall` function from the README_checks package to find all occurrences of text between `# Question` and `# Answer`. It then strips any leading spaces or newlines from these matches using the `strip` function. If there are not exactly two matches (i.e., if there is no 'Question' section or no 'Answer' section), it throws an error.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the markdown file follows the standard format where each question and answer section starts with a `# Question` or `# Answer` line, respectively. If your markdown files have a different format, you would need to modify the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[398,348],"elapsed":6.15738015,"_type":"aimessage"}]
