[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple solution using Julia's built-in regular expression function `match` to find the sections:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = match(r\"# Question(.*?)(?=# Answer)\", md, re.MULTILINE | re.DOTALL).captures[1]\n    answer = match(r\"# Answer(.*)\", md, re.MULTILINE | re.DOTALL).captures[1]\n\n    # Remove leading spaces and newlines\n    question = replace(question, r\"\\n^ +\" => \"\")\n    answer = replace(answer, r\"\\n^ +\" => \"\")\n\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by using regular expressions to match the sections of text that start with `# Question` and `# Answer`. The `captures[1]` part gets the first matching group. \n\nThe `(.*?)` in the regex matches any characters (except for newlines), `.*?` is a non-greedy match, meaning it will stop at the closest possible point to fulfill the match, rather than trying to match as many characters as possible. \n\nThe `re.MULTILINE | re.DOTALL` flags are used to make the regex work across multiple lines and also to include newlines in `.`.\n\nFinally, the `strip` function is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from both the question and answer strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,334],"elapsed":5.848466762,"_type":"aimessage"}]
