[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might approach this using the `Markdown.jl` package in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    blocks = split(md, \"## \")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    for block in blocks\n        lines = split(block, \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(lines[1], \"# Question\") \n            question = join(map(x -> strip(x), filter!(x -> !startswith(x, \"###\"), lines[2:end])), \" \")\n        elseif startswith(lines[1], \"# Answer\")\n            answer = join(filter!(x -> !startswith(x, \"###\"), lines[2:end]), \" \")\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function splits the input `md` into blocks based on `##` as a separator. Then it checks if each block starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`. If it does, it extracts the relevant text and assigns it to `question` or `answer`, respectively. It strips leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text using Julia's built-in string processing functions. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,294],"elapsed":5.138197983,"_type":"aimessage"}]
