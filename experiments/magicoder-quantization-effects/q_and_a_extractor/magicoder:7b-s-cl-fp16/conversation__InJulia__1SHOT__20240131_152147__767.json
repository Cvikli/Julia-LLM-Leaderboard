If so, it sets a corresponding flag to `true`, indicating that subsequent lines should be added to the question or answer. If not, but both flags are true, it adds the line to the answer.\n\nThe `strip(line[2:end])` part strips any leading spaces from the line and returns only the text content.","status":200,"tokens":[0,305],"elapsed":5.271532063,"_type":"aimessage"}]
