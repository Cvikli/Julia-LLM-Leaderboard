[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use Julia's built-in regular expression capabilities to solve this problem efficiently. Here is an implementation of `q_and_a_extractor`:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = replace(matchall(r\"# Question\\n(.*?)(?=\\n*# Answer)\", md; regex=true)[1], r\"\\s*\" => \"\", r\"\\n\" => \" \")\n    answer = replace(matchall(r\"# Answer\\n(.*?)\\n(?=\\n*\\Z)\", md; regex=true)[1], r\"\\s*\" => \"\", r\"\\n\" => \" \")\n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\n\nHere's how it works: `q_and_a_extractor` uses two regular expressions to extract the question and answer from the markdown text. The first one, `# Question\\n(.*?)(?=\\n*# Answer)`, matches the part of the markdown that starts with \"# Question\", captures all characters until it encounters a line starting with \"# Answer\". The second one, `# Answer\\n(.*?)\\n(?=\\n*\\Z)`, is similar but for the part of the text that starts with \"# Answer\" and ends at the end of the input string.\n\nThe `matchall` function returns all matches in an array. We only care about the first match here, so we use `[1]` to get it, then apply the `replace` function to remove any leading spaces or newlines using regular expressions. The `r\"\\s*\" => \"\", r\"\\n\" => \" \"` part of `replace` removes all instances of whitespace (spaces, tabs) and newlines from the matched text.\n\nThis solution assumes that your markdown text is well-formed: it always starts with a line with \"# Question\", followed by some text (the question), then another line with \"# Answer\" and then the answer. Any lines before or after this structure are ignored.","status":200,"tokens":[0,430],"elapsed":7.516254286,"_type":"aimessage"}]
