The `capture=true` keyword in the match function makes it extract these parts for us. \n\nThe `replace()` function then removes any leading spaces or newlines from the extracted text by replacing them with an empty string.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n    # Question\n    This is a question about programming in Julia.\n    \n    # Answer\n    The answer to your question is yes, indeed. Programming in Julia is quite fun!\n    \"\"\"\nquestion_answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: \", question_answer[1])\nprintln(\"Answer: \", question_answer[2])\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,333],"elapsed":5.819969937,"_type":"aimessage"}]
