[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is an example of how you could solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestionSection = false\n    inAnswerSection = false\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestionSection = true\n            continue\n        elseif inQuestionSection && !startswith(line, \"## Answer\")\n            question *= strip(line[1:end])\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inAnswerSection = true\n            continue\n        elseif inAnswerSection \n            answer *= strip(line[1:end])\n        end\n    end\n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\n\nThe `startswith` function checks if the given string starts with a specified substring. The `strip` function removes any leading spaces and newlines from a string. \n\nThis code assumes that there is only one question followed by one answer in the markdown text. If multiple questions or answers exist, you might want to adjust this implementation accordingly. For example, you could store all questions and answers in arrays and return these arrays as tuples.","status":200,"tokens":[0,281],"elapsed":4.966032522,"_type":"aimessage"}]
