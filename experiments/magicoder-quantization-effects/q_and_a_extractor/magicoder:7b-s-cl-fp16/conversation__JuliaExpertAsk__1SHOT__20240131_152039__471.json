The `re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE` flags are used in order to make the dot (.) match any character at all, including a newline.\n\nThe extracted text is then stripped of leading spaces and newlines using regular expressions again (`\\A[ \\t]*\\n|\\n[ \\t]*\\Z`). The `strip()` function removes trailing spaces as well. \n\nFinally, the function returns the question(s) and answer(s) in a tuple. If there are no questions or answers found, it will return an empty string for that field.","status":200,"tokens":[0,377],"elapsed":6.537008724,"_type":"aimessage"}]
