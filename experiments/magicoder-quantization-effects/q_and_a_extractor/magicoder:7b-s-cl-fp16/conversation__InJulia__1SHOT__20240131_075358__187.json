If it's a question, it appends the line to `question` variable after stripping any leading spaces. Same goes for the answer. The `strip` function is used to remove any leading spaces and newlines from the text.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is your name?\n\n# Answer\nMy name is Julia.\n\"\"\"\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md)) # prints (\"What is your name?\", \"My name is Julia.\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,333],"elapsed":5.758105508,"_type":"aimessage"}]
