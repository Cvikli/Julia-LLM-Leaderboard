[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example solution using regular expressions:\n```julia\nusing Regex\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question = match(r\"# Question(.*?)# Answer\", md, re\"s\") do match\n        return strip(match.captures[1])\n    end\n    \n    answer = match(r\"# Answer(.*?)(?:#|$)\", md, re\"s\") do match\n        return strip(match.captures[1])\n    end\n    \n    if question === nothing || answer === nothing\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Markdown does not have a Question or an Answer.\"))\n    else\n        return (question, answer)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first extracts the text between `# Question` and `# Answer` using a regular expression. Then, it extracts the text between `# Answer` and either the next `#` or the end of the string. It strips any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text before returning them as a tuple.\n\nPlease note that the regular expressions used here are quite simple and may not work for all possible inputs. If you have more complex markdown formatting, you might need to adjust the regular expressions accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,270],"elapsed":4.702196435,"_type":"aimessage"}]
