Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Python solution using regular expressions to match the question and answer sections:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    pattern = r\"(?<=# Question\\n)(.*?)(?=\\n# Answer)\"\n    matches = re.findall(pattern, md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    if not matches:\n        return None\n    \n    question = \"\\n\".join([x.lstrip(\" \") for x in matches[0].split(\"\\n\")])\n    answer = \"\\n\".join([x.lstrip(\" \") for x in matches[1].split(\"\\n\")])\n\n    return (question, answer)\n```\nIn this function, we first compile a regular expression pattern that looks for the \"Question\" and \"Answer\" sections of your markdown text. The `?=` syntax means \"match only if it's followed by\", which helps us get rid of any leading white space in our matches. \n\nThe `.lstrip(\" \")` function is used to remove any leading spaces from the matched text, since Python's regular expression matching includes whitespace before and after the matched text. The `re.DOTALL` flag tells the `findall` function to treat the input as a single string, not as individual lines.\n\nFinally, we return the question and answer as a tuple. If there are no matches (i.e., no sections labeled \"Question\" and \"Answer\"), we return `None`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,329],"elapsed":5.768982671,"_type":"aimessage"}]
