[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could approach this problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(strip(md), '\\n')  # Split the markdown into individual lines.\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question, in_answer = false, false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if in_question && isempty(question)\n            question = strip(replace(line, r\"^# \" => \"\"))  # Remove '# Question' and leading spaces.\n        elseif in_answer && isempty(answer)\n            answer = strip(replace(line, r\"^# \" => \"\"))  # Remove '# Answer' and leading spaces.\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each line of the provided markdown text and checking if it's a question or an answer section based on whether it starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If it is, we set `in_question` or `in_answer` to true. If it isn't but we are currently in a question/answer section, we strip the '# ' from the start of the line and add it to our respective variables (`question` or `answer`). The function returns these two strings in a tuple.\n\nAs for the \"Special Instructions\", you can use this function like so:\n```julia\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Question\nHow do I write a function in Julia?\n\n# Answer\nYou can define functions using the `function` keyword followed by the name of your function and its parameters. The body of the function is indented, just like an if statement or loop. Here's an example:\n```\ninstructions = \"\"\"\nInstructions for this task go here...\n\"\"\"\nq_and_a = q_and_a_extractor(md_text * \"\\n\" * instructions)\nprintln(\"Question: $(q_and_a[1])\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $(q_and_a[2])\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,519],"elapsed":9.19959327,"_type":"aimessage"}]
