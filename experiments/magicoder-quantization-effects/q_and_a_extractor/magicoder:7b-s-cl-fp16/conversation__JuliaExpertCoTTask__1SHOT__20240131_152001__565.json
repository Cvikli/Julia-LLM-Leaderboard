Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that uses regex to extract the question and answer from the markdown-formatted text:\n\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    m = match(r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n# Answer\\n(.*)\", md, dotall=true)\n    question = strip(m.captures[1])\n    answer = strip(m.captures[2])\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by looking for the sections \"Question\" and \"Answer\". The `match` function returns a Match object that contains all the captures made in the pattern. In this case, there are two captures: one for everything after \"# Question\\n\" until the next newline (\\n), and another for everything after \"# Answer\\n\" until the end of the string.\n\nThe `dotall=true` option is used to make \".\" match any character including newlines. The `strip` function removes leading spaces and newlines from each section.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n# Answer\\nThe capital of France is Paris.\"\nq_and_a_extractor(md)\n```\nThis will return `(\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,314],"elapsed":5.456086213,"_type":"aimessage"}]
