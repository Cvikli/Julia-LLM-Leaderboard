Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of `q_and_a_extractor` function using Python's built-in markdown library:\n\n```python\nimport re\nfrom markdown import markdown\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = re.findall(r'\\n# Question(.*?)# Answer', md, re.DOTALL)\n    answer = re.findall(r'# Answer(.*?)(?=\\n# Question|\\n$)', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    if question and answer:\n        return (markdown(question[0].strip()), markdown(answer[0].strip()))\n    else:\n        return (\"No question or answer found\", \"\")\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find the sections of text between `# Question` and `# Answer`. The `re.DOTALL` flag allows `.` to match any character, including newlines. It then converts these matched strings into HTML using Python's markdown library (you may need to install it with pip if you haven't done so already) before returning them in a tuple.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is only one question and answer per input `md`. If your input can contain multiple questions or answers, you will need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,287],"elapsed":5.031456558,"_type":"aimessage"}]
