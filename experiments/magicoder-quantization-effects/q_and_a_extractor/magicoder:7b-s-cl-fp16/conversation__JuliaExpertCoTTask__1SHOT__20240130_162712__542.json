When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia function that extracts question and answer from a given markdown formatted text:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n        end\n        \n        if in_question && !startswith(line, \"# \")\n            question *= line[4:end]\n        elseif in_answer && !startswith(line, \"# \")\n            answer *= line[5:end]\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function splits the input text `md` by newline character `\\n` and processes each line. If it encounters a line starting with `# Question`, it starts capturing question, same for `# Answer`. It continues to do so until it encounters another line that starts with `# `. After processing all lines, it returns the extracted questions and answers as a tuple after stripping any leading spaces and newline characters.\n\nNow you can test your function using the provided data:\n```julia\nmd = \"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\"\n\nq_and_a_extractor(md)\n```\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the markdown format strictly adheres to the provided pattern (each section starting with `# `, question and answer separated by a blank line). If not, some adjustments might be necessary.","status":200,"tokens":[0,392],"elapsed":6.89946281,"_type":"aimessage"}]
