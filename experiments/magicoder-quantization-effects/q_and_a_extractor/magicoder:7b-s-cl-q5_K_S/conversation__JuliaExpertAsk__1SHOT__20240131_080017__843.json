The `re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE` flags are used to make `.` match any character at all, including a newline, and `(?=\\n\\n|\\Z)` is a positive lookahead that ensures we only capture up until the next blank line or end of string.\n\nThe `re.sub(r'\\s*(?:\\n|\\r)\\s*', '', ...)` part removes any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\nIf there are no questions or answers in the markdown, it returns `None`. If there is more than one question or answer, only the first one will be returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,343],"elapsed":2.987032537,"_type":"aimessage"}]
