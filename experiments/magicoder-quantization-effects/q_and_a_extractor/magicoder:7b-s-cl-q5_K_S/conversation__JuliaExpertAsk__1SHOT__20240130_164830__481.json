Depending on whether we're in a question or an answer section (`inQuestion` and `inAnswer`), we either add to the corresponding variable (trimming leading spaces). We ignore sections that start with \"## \", which are sub-sections under the main Question/Answer titles.\n\nThis function assumes that each question has exactly one answer, and it does not handle cases where there might be multiple answers. If you need to handle those cases, you'll have to adjust the implementation accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,329],"elapsed":2.865917698,"_type":"aimessage"}]
