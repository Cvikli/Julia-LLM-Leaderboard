Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

If a line starts with `# Question`, it sets `inQuestion` to true which tells the program that we are in question section. Similarly for the answer part. It also checks if `inQuestion` or `inAnswer` is true before adding the line to `question` or `answer`. The text extracted from each section will have leading spaces and newlines removed by calling `strip()` function on them.\n\nNote: This function assumes that there's only one `# Question` and one `# Answer` in your markdown string. If you may have multiple sections, this code will need to be modified.","status":200,"tokens":[0,333],"elapsed":2.86700754,"_type":"aimessage"}]
