[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could write this function using Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)::Tuple{String, String}\n    # Convert the markdown to a parsed AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)\n    doc = parse_markdown(md)\n    \n    # Extract the Question and Answer sections\n    question = \"\"\n    answer   = \"\"\n\n    for block in each_block(doc)\n        if firstline(block) == \"# Question\" \n            question = strip(restofblock(block))\n        elseif firstline(block) == \"# Answer\"\n            answer = strip(restofblock(block))\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return the extracted question and answer as a tuple\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function uses `Markdown.jl` to parse the markdown document into an Abstract Syntax Tree, then iterates over each block in the document checking for the `# Question` or `# Answer` headers. If these are found it extracts and strips any leading spaces and newlines from the block content respectively and assigns them to `question` or `answer`. Finally, it returns a tuple of the extracted question and answer.\n\nPlease note that this is just an example and might not work as expected if your markdown document does not adhere exactly to the format you specified. It also assumes that there will only be one \"# Question\" section and one \"# Answer\" section in the document, which may or may not be a valid assumption depending on your use case.","status":200,"tokens":[0,350],"elapsed":3.111202605,"_type":"aimessage"}]
