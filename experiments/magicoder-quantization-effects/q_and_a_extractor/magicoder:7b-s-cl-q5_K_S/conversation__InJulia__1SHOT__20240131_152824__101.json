[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you can solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestionSection = false\n    inAnswerSection = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestionSection = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inQuestionSection = false\n            inAnswerSection = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if inQuestionSection\n            question *= line[end] # append to the question string\n        elseif inAnswerSection\n            answer *= line[end] # append to the answer string\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the markdown text into lines and iterating over each line. If a line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it toggles the corresponding boolean variable `inQuestionSection` or `inAnswerSection`. When these variables are true, it appends to the relevant string (question or answer). The strip function is used to remove any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\nNote: This code assumes that each question has exactly one answer and does not handle cases where a question might have multiple answers (or no answers) or where there are sections of markdown outside of the Question/Answer sections. If these assumptions do not hold, you would need to modify this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,347],"elapsed":2.938967873,"_type":"aimessage"}]
