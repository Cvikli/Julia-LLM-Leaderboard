[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible solution using Julia's built-in Markdown parser `Documenter.jl`. This package can parse and manipulate markdown documents in Julia. Note that the code needs to be run in an environment with Documenter.jl installed. \n\n```julia\nusing Documenter\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)::Tuple{String, String}\n    parsed = Markdown.parse(md)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    for block in parsed\n        if typeof(block) <: Documenter.Fields.MetaBlock\n            for field in block.fields\n                if field[1] == :Questions\n                    question = strip(field[2])\n                elseif field[1] == :Answers\n                    answer = strip(field[2])\n                end\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first parses the markdown document into an AbstractSyntaxTree. It then loops through each block in this tree. Each block is a field from which we can extract its type and content. If it's a `:Questions` or `:Answers`, we strip the leading spaces, newlines, and return the question and answer separately.\n\nKeep in mind that this solution assumes you have `# Questions` or `# Answers` headers in your markdown file. It would be different if your markdown uses different conventions to denote questions or answers.","status":200,"tokens":[398,331],"elapsed":3.058612601,"_type":"aimessage"}]
