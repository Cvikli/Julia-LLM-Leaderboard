It checks if the current line is a header for either a question or an answer based on the line's prefix and toggles the corresponding boolean variable. If it's a regular line and inside a question/answer section, it concatenates the stripped line to the appropriate variable. The function finally returns a tuple with the extracted question and answer text.\n\nYou can use this function by passing your markdown string like `q_and_a_extractor(\"\"\"\n# Question: What is your name?\nYour name is...\n# Answer: Your name is John Doe.\n\"\"\")`","status":200,"tokens":[0,387],"elapsed":3.321069167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
