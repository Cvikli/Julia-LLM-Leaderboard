[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could solve this task using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\") \n            question = strip(line[13:end])\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer = strip(line[10:end])\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nThis function `q_and_a_extractor` splits the input markdown text by newline characters and checks each line for whether it starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If it does, it strips the prefix from the line and assigns it to the variable \"question\" or \"answer\", respectively. The `strip` function is used to remove any leading spaces or newlines from the extracted text.\n\nIf there's a specific format for how the markdown sections are formatted in your problem (for example, maybe the text should start after the '#' character rather than a specific string), you could adjust this code accordingly. \n\nRemember that this is quite a basic solution and may not work with more complex markdown structures. For a robust solution, you might want to use an existing library like `Markdown.jl`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,310],"elapsed":2.727236321,"_type":"aimessage"}]
