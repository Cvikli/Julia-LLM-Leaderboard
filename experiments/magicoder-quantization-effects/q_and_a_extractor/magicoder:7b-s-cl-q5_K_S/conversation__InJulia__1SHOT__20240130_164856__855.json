Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

Then it goes through each line and checks if it is a question or answer section header. If found, it toggles the corresponding boolean to true and skips that line. Otherwise, it appends the text of the current line to either `question` or `answer`, depending on which section we're currently in. After scanning all lines, it strips any leading/trailing whitespaces and newlines from both the question and answer strings and returns them as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,325],"elapsed":2.788744066,"_type":"aimessage"}]
