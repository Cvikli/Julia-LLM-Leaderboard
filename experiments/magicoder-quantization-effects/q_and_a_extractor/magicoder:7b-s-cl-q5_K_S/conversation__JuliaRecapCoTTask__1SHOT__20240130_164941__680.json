[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem, you can use Julia's `Markdown.parse` function to parse the markdown string into an AbstractSyntaxTree (AST), then traverse the AST looking for specific sections of text that start with `# Question` and `# Answer`. Here is a sample implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    parsed = Markdown.parse(md)\n\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    for block in blocks(parsed)\n        if isa(block, Markdown.Paragraph) && startswith(block.text, \"# Question\")\n            question = strip(join(block.content))\n        elseif isa(block, Markdown.Paragraph) && startswith(block.text, \"# Answer\")\n            answer = strip(join(block.content))\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThe function `q_and_a_extractor` takes a markdown-formatted string as an input and returns a tuple containing the question and answer extracted from the text. The `strip` function is used to remove any leading spaces or newlines present in the text. \n\nIf you need to handle multiple questions or answers, you can modify this solution by storing all questions and answers and returning them in a list of tuples. \n\nThe instructions are passed as `{instructions}` in the function call and are replaced with actual instructions during code execution.","status":200,"tokens":[11,333],"elapsed":2.959122772,"_type":"aimessage"}]
