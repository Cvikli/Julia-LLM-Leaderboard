[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem using Julia's `replace` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = replace(md, r\"^# Question\\n(.*?)\\n# Answer\"s => \\1; flags=re.MULTILINE | re.DOTALL)\n    answer = replace(md, r\"^# Answer\\n(.*?)\\n# End\"s => \\1; flags=re.MULTILINE | re.DOTALL)\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to match the sections of text that start with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively, and captures everything in between. The `?` after `.*` makes it a non-greedy match, meaning it will stop at the first `# Answer` or `# End` encountered. The `s` flag is used to make the pattern work on multi-line strings.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no other sections in your markdown file starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, and also assumes that there's a `# End` after the answer section. If these assumptions don't hold, you may need to adjust the regular expressions or add additional checks.","status":200,"tokens":[0,286],"elapsed":2.473197613,"_type":"aimessage"}]
