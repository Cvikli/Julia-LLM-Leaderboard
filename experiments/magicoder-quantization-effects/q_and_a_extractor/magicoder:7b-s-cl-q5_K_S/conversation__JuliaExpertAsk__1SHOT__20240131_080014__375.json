Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

The `re.findall()` method returns a list of matching strings, so we take the first element from these lists (`question[0]` and `answer[0]`) and strip any leading spaces or newlines with `.strip()`. If there is no match (i.e., if the markdown doesn't contain either `# Question` or `# Answer`), it returns an empty string.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```python\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is your name?\n# Answer\nMy name is Julia.\n\"\"\"\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(md))  # Outputs: ('What is your name?', 'My name is Julia.')\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,285],"elapsed":2.457785279,"_type":"aimessage"}]
