[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is a Julia function which will extract the question and answer from the markdown text:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString) \n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n            in_question = false\n        end \n        \n        if in_question && !isempty(strip(line))\n            question *= line[4:end]\n        elseif in_answer && !isempty(strip(line))\n            answer *= line[7:end]\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the markdown text into lines and iterating through each line. If it encounters a line starting with \"# Question\", it sets `in_question` to true, if it encounters a line starting with \"# Answer\", it sets `in_answer` to true and sets `in_question` to false. It then checks for lines inside the question or answer section (by checking whether `in_question` is true or `in_answer` is true) and adds them to their respective strings. \n\nFor each line, it removes leading spaces using `line[4:end]` if we are in a question section and `line[7:end]` if we are in an answer section to remove the hash and space that markdown uses for headers. It finally returns a tuple of stripped strings for the question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,392],"elapsed":3.45204628,"_type":"aimessage"}]
