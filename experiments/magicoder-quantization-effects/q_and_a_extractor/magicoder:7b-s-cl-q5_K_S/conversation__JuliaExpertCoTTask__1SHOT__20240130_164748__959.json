Then it goes through each line one by one, checking if we're currently processing a question or an answer and what to do with the current line. If we find a new section, we switch our \"in\" variable accordingly. For any lines that aren't empty, we strip the leading whitespace (so we can just add the line directly) and append it to the correct part of our results.\n\nTo use this function:\n```julia\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\"))\n```\nThis should output: \n`(\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris\")`","status":200,"tokens":[0,399],"elapsed":3.453706785,"_type":"aimessage"}]
