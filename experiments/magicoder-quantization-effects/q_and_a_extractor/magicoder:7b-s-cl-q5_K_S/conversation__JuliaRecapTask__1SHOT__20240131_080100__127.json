[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestionSection = false\n    inAnswerSection = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestionSection = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inQuestionSection = false\n            inAnswerSection = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if inQuestionSection\n            question *= line[end]\n        elseif inAnswerSection\n            answer *= line[end]\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function splits the markdown text into lines and iterates through each line. If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\", it sets `inQuestionSection` to true and continues to the next line. Similarly, if it encounters a line that starts with \"# Answer\", it sets `inAnswerSection` to true and continues to the next line.\n\nIf it is in the question section (i.e., `inQuestionSection` is true), it appends the current line to the `question`. If it is in the answer section (i.e., `inAnswerSection` is true), it appends the current line to the `answer`.\n\nFinally, it returns a tuple of stripped strings `(strip(question), strip(answer))`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,354],"elapsed":3.137028051,"_type":"aimessage"}]
