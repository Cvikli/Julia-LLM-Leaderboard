Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might write this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    \n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestionSection = false\n    inAnswerSection = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestionSection = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inAnswerSection = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if inQuestionSection && !startswith(line, \" \")\n            inQuestionSection = false\n        end\n        \n        if inAnswerSection && !startswith(line, \" \")\n            answer *= line[end] == ' ' ? line[2:end-1] : line\n        elseif inQuestionSection\n            question *= line[end] == ' ' ? line[2:end-1] : line\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating through each line of the markdown text. If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\", it sets `inQuestionSection` to true and continues processing the next lines. Similarly, if it encounters a line that starts with \"# Answer\", it sets `inAnswerSection` to true and continues processing the next lines. Whenever it encounters a line that is not indented (i.e., does not start with a space), it sets its corresponding section to false. Any text in these sections is then appended to the respective variables, stripping leading spaces and newlines as it goes. Finally, once all lines have been processed, the function returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,399],"elapsed":3.40238613,"_type":"aimessage"}]
