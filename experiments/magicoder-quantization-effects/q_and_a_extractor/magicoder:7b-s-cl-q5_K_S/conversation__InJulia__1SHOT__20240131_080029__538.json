[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could implement this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestion = false\n    inAnswer = false\n    \n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestion = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inQuestion = false\n            inAnswer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if inQuestion\n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif inAnswer\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nThis function reads the markdown line by line and checks whether each line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If it does, it sets a flag accordingly. If it's not a question or answer line but falls within a question or answer section, it appends the stripped text to the appropriate variable.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that your markdown is formatted correctly and doesn't contain nested sections. If there are nested sections (like `# Question` inside another `# Question`), you would need a more complex solution.","status":200,"tokens":[0,285],"elapsed":2.450450898,"_type":"aimessage"}]
