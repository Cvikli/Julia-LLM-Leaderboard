[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is an example of how you can solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_question && !isempty(strip(line))\n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif in_answer && !isempty(strip(line))\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nIn this function, we split the input markdown string by newline characters and iterate through each line. We use `startswith` to check if a line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", which indicate the beginning of either question section or answer section. For lines that are not in the question or answer sections but belong to them (i.e., they contain some content), we add their stripped contents to corresponding variables (`question` and `answer`). At last, we return a tuple containing the extracted question and answer text. \n\nRemember to strip leading spaces and newlines from each line before adding it to the question or answer variable because markdown format may have these characters at the start of lines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,348],"elapsed":2.978414531,"_type":"aimessage"}]
