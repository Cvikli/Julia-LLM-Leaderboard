[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of such function written in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            continue\n        elseif in_question && !startswith(line, \"## \")\n            question *= lstrip(rstrip(line))\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        elseif in_answer && !startswith(line, \"## \")\n            answer *= lstrip(rstrip(line))\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each line of the input markdown string. If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\", it switches on to collecting question text. Similarly, if it encounters a line starting with \"# Answer\", it switches on to collecting answer text. All other lines are ignored. It keeps adding to `question` and `answer` variables until the next section is encountered.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes well-formatted markdown where each section starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`, followed by a space, and then the actual content of the section.","status":200,"tokens":[0,326],"elapsed":2.757424908,"_type":"aimessage"}]
