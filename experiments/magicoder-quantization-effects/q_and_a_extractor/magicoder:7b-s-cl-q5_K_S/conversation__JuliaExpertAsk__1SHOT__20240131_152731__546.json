Whenever it encounters the lines starting with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it switches its state to either collecting question or answer, and continues. Otherwise, if it is currently collecting question or answer and encounters non-empty lines, it appends stripped version of those lines to the current section.\n\nAfter processing all lines, it returns a tuple with both question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[128,318],"elapsed":2.730801925,"_type":"aimessage"}]
