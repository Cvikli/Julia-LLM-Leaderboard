If a line starts with `# Question`, it sets `current` to `:question`. Similarly, if a line starts with `# Answer`, it sets `current` to `:answer`. For any other lines, it checks whether `current` is set to either `:question` or `:answer` and if the line is not empty after stripping leading spaces. If these conditions are met, it appends the line to the corresponding variable (`question` for `:question`, `answer` for `:answer`).\n\nFinally, it returns a tuple with the extracted question and answer text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,314],"elapsed":2.667280528,"_type":"aimessage"}]
