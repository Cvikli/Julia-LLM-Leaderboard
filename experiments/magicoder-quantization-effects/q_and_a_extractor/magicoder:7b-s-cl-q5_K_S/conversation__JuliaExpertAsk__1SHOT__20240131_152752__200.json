If a line starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`, it sets the corresponding flag to true and continues to the next line. It then checks if the current line is not starting with a space (which means it's not indented) and appends the text to either the question or answer variable accordingly. The `strip` function is used to remove any leading spaces or newlines from the extracted text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,304],"elapsed":2.589696552,"_type":"aimessage"}]
