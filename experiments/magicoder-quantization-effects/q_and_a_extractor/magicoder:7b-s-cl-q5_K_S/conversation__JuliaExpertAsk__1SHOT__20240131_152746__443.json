If it encounters a line that starts with `# Question`, it sets `in_question_section` to true and starts accumulating question text. Similarly, if it encounters a line that starts with `# Answer`, it sets `in_answer_section` to true and starts accumulating answer text. It continues this until it has found both the question and the answer.\n\nAfter finding the sections, it removes leading spaces and newlines from each section using Julia's `strip` function and returns a tuple with the extracted question and answer texts.","status":200,"tokens":[0,318],"elapsed":2.696545415,"_type":"aimessage"}]
