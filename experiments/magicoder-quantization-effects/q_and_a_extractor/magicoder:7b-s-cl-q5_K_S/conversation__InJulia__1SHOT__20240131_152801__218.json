[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can do this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    current_section = \"\"\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            current_section = \"question\"\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            current_section = \"answer\"\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# \") && current_section == \"question\"\n            question *= line[8:end]\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# \") && current_section == \"answer\"\n            answer *= line[8:end]\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function first splits the markdown text into lines. Then it iterates over each line, checking if it starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`. If so, it changes the `current_section` variable to either \"question\" or \"answer\". If a line in the correct section (i.e., starts with \"# \") and is not in the current section, it appends the text after the \"# \" to the appropriate string. Finally, it returns the stripped versions of the question and answer strings as a tuple.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that each `# Question` or `# Answer` line will be followed by another line with actual content. If there are other lines without starting with \"# \", they may mess up the extraction process.","status":200,"tokens":[98,351],"elapsed":2.999652794,"_type":"aimessage"}]
