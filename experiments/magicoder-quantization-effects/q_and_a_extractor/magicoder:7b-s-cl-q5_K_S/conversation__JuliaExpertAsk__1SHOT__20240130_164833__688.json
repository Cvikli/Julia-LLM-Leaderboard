When it finds a line starting with `# Question`, it switches on `inQuestion` and continues to ignore lines until the next question or answer section is reached. Similarly, when it sees a line starting with `# Answer`, it stops collecting questions. For other lines in between these sections, it appends them to either `question` or `answer`. \n\nPlease note that this function does not handle nested sections (like \"### Subsection\" under \"# Question\"). If you need to handle such scenarios, you would need a more complex parser which can parse and handle markdown syntax.","status":200,"tokens":[0,324],"elapsed":2.796215064,"_type":"aimessage"}]
