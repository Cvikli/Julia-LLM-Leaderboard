Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestionSection = false\n    inAnswerSection = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestionSection = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inAnswerSection = true\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if inQuestionSection && !inAnswerSection\n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif inAnswerSection && !startswith(line, \"## \")\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function splits the input string `md` into lines and iterates over each line. If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\", it sets `inQuestionSection` to true and continues to the next line. Similarly, if it encounters a line that starts with \"# Answer\", it sets `inAnswerSection` to true and continues to the next line.\n\nIf it is currently in the question section (i.e., `inQuestionSection == true`) and not yet in the answer section (i.e., `inAnswerSection == false`), it appends the stripped version of the current line to the question string. If it encounters a line that starts with \"## \", it assumes we've finished reading the answer section, so it stops adding lines to the answer string.\n\nFinally, it returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,378],"elapsed":3.254092605,"_type":"aimessage"}]
