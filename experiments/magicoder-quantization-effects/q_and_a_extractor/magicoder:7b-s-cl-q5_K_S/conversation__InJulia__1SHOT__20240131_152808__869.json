The `replace` function replaces these lines with a space in between them, effectively separating the question and answer. Then it strips any leading spaces or newlines from both strings using the `strip` function.\n\nYou can test this function on some input:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\n    What is your name?\n# Answer\n    My name is Julia.\n\"\"\"\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md))  # Outputs: (\"What is your name?\", \"My name is Julia.\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,248],"elapsed":2.094303429,"_type":"aimessage"}]
