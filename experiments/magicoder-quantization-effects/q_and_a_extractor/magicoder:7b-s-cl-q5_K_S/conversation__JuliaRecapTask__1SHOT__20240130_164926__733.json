[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this task using Julia's `replace` function to replace the Markdown headers with regular text strings, then `split` the text by these strings. Here is a code snippet demonstrating this:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    md = replace(md, \"# Question\" => \"Q\")\n    md = replace(md, \"# Answer\" => \"A\")\n    question, answer = split(md, 'Q', limit=2)\n    question = strip(question[findfirst(isequal('Q'), question)+1:end]) # strip leading spaces and newlines\n    answer = strip(answer[findfirst(isequal('A'), answer)+1:end])       # strip leading spaces and newlines\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by replacing the specific header strings with a placeholder symbol (`Q` for question and `A` for answer). Then it splits the input string into two parts at the first occurrence of the placeholder. After that, it strips leading spaces and newlines from each part (since split method doesn't do this automatically), and returns these as a tuple.\n\nThis function assumes that there is only one `# Question` or `# Answer` in the markdown string, and that no headers are nested. If those assumptions may not hold true for your use case, you will need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,308],"elapsed":2.711616243,"_type":"aimessage"}]
