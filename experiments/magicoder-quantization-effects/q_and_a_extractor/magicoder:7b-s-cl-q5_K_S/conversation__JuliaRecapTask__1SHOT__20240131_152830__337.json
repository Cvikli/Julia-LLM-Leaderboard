[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example solution written in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question *= line[13:end] # get the text after \"# Question\"\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer *= line[12:end]  # get the text after \"# Answer\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function splits the markdown string into lines and iterates over each line. If a line starts with `# Question`, it appends the text to `question` variable. If a line starts with `# Answer`, it appends the text to `answer` variable. After going through all the lines, it returns a tuple of stripped questions and answers.\n\nNote: This function assumes that each question is followed by its answer directly in the markdown file. If there are multiple sections (questions and answers), this function will only consider the last one. Also, it doesn't handle nested questions or answers.","status":200,"tokens":[0,274],"elapsed":2.383231344,"_type":"aimessage"}]
