If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\", it sets `in_question` to true and begins recording the question. Similarly, if it encounters a line that starts with \"# Answer\", it sets `in_answer` to true and begins recording the answer. It then appends each line of text (without leading spaces) to the appropriate variable (`question` or `answer`) depending on whether it's inside a question or an answer section.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the sections are well-formed and don't overlap or nest, and that there's no extra whitespace at the start of each line within the sections.","status":200,"tokens":[0,342],"elapsed":2.903780833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
