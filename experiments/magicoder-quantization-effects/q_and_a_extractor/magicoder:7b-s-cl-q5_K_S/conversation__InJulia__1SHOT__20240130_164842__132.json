If it's a start of question/answer block, it sets corresponding flags (in_question and in_answer). \nIf this line belongs to question or answer (checked by flags), strips leading spaces from the string, appends it to question/answer strings accordingly. Finally returns the extracted question and answer strings after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces from them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,368],"elapsed":3.155811987,"_type":"aimessage"}]
