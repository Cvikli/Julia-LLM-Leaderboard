[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could write this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            continue\n        elseif in_question && !startswith(line, \" \")\n            question *= line[2:end]\n            in_question = false\n        end\n        \n        if startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        elseif in_answer && !startswith(line, \" \")\n            answer *= line[2:end]\n            in_answer = false\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the input markdown string into lines and then iterating over each line. If a line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it sets the corresponding flag to true and continues to the next line. If a line starts with a space (indicating that it's not part of the header), it appends the text to the question or answer string, stripping any leading spaces. Finally, it returns a tuple of the extracted question and answer strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,316],"elapsed":2.727905839,"_type":"aimessage"}]
