Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can do this using Julia's `eachline` function to iterate over each line of the markdown file:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestionSection = false\n    inAnswerSection = false\n    \n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestionSection = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inAnswerSection = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if inQuestionSection && !startswith(line, \"## \")\n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif inAnswerSection && !startswith(line, \"## \")\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nThis function goes through each line of the markdown file. If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\", it sets `inQuestionSection` to true and continues to the next line. Similarly, if it encounters a line that starts with \"# Answer\", it sets `inAnswerSection` to true and continues to the next line.\n\nIf it is currently in the question section (`inQuestionSection == true`) and the current line does not start with \"## \", then it appends the stripped version of the line to the question string. Similarly, if it is currently in the answer section (`inAnswerSection == true`) and the current line does not start with \"## \", then it appends the stripped version of the line to the answer string.\n\nOnce it has gone through all lines, it returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,388],"elapsed":3.338949946,"_type":"aimessage"}]
