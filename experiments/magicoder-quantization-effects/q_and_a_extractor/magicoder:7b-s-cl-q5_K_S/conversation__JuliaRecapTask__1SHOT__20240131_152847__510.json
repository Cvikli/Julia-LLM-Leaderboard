[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestion = false\n    inAnswer = false\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestion = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inQuestion = false\n            inAnswer = true\n        end\n        if inQuestion && !isempty(line)\n            question *= strip(line[2:end])*'\\n'\n        elseif inAnswer && !isempty(line)\n            answer *= strip(line[2:end])*'\\n'\n        end\n    end\n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nIn this function, we split the markdown text into lines and go through each line. If a line starts with \"# Question\", we set `inQuestion` to true and if it starts with \"# Answer\", we set `inAnswer` to true. Then for each line, if `inQuestion` is true and the line is not empty, we add the stripped content of the line (excluding the '#') to the question string. Same applies for the answer part.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that a \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\" line always starts a new section. If there could be other lines starting with '#' in your markdown, you would need a more complex solution to handle these cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,346],"elapsed":3.008677586,"_type":"aimessage"}]
