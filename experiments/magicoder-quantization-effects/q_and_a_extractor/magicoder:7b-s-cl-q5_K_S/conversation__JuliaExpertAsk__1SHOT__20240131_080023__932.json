For example, if you have the following markdown text:\n\n```markdown\n# Question\nThis is the question?\n\n# Answer\nThis is the answer!\n```\n\nThen you can call `q_and_a_extractor` with this text like so:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nThis is the question?\n\n# Answer\nThis is the answer!\n\"\"\"\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md)) # Outputs: (\"This is the question?\", \"This is the answer!\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,359],"elapsed":3.132049714,"_type":"aimessage"}]
