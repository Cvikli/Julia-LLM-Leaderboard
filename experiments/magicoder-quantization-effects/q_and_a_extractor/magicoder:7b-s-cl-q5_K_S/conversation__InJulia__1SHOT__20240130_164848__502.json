[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem using Regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = match(r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n## Answer\", md, re\"\").captures[1]\n    answer   = match(r\"# Answer\\n(.*?)\\n$\", md, re\"\").captures[1]\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function uses two regular expressions to match the blocks of text between `# Question` and `# Answer`. The `match()` function returns a Match object that can be used to access the matched data. The `.captures[]` method gives us an array with all the captures made by parentheses in our regex (in this case, one capture for each set of parentheses).\n\nHere's how you might use it:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\n    This is a question? \n## Answer\n    Here is an answer.\n\"\"\"\n@show q_and_a_extractor(md) # => (\"This is a question?\",\"Here is an answer.\")\n```\n\nNote that this assumes the input text will always be well-formed and will exactly match your requested format. If that's not the case, you may need to add error checking or other robustness measures.","status":200,"tokens":[0,304],"elapsed":2.611911745,"_type":"aimessage"}]
