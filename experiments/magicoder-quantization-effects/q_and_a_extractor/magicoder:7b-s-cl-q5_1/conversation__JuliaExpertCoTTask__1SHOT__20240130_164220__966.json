Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

It then iterates over each line in this list, checking if it's the start of a question or an answer section. If so, it appends all subsequent lines to our current question or answer variable after stripping leading spaces and newlines.\n\nThe `q_and_a_extractor` function works with the following assumption: the `# Question` and `# Answer` sections are always on separate lines with no other text on the same line. If this is not the case, you may need to adjust your approach accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,361],"elapsed":3.288382861,"_type":"aimessage"}]
