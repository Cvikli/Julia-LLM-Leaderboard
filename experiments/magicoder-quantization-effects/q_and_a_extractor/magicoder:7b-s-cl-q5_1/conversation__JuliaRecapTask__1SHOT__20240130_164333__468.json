[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function that can be used to extract the question and answer from markdown-formatted text:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\") # Split md into lines\n    question_started = false \n    answer_started = false\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\") \n            question_started = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\") \n            answer_started = true\n        elseif question_started && !answer_started\n            push!(question, strip(line))\n        elseif answer_started && !startswith(line, \" \")\n            push!(answer, strip(line))\n        end\n    end \n    return (join(question), join(answer)) # Convert arrays to strings and return as tuple\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating through each line in the markdown text. If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\", it sets `question_started` to true, and if it encounters a line that starts with \"# Answer\" then it sets `answer_started` to true. If `question_started` is true but `answer_started` isn't, it adds the stripped line (after removing leading spaces) to the question. Similarly, if `answer_started` is true and the current line doesn't start with a space (which would imply there are no more lines in the answer), it adds the stripped line to the answer. Finally, once all lines have been processed, it returns the question and answer as strings, joined together, in a tuple.\n\nNote: This function assumes that the markdown text is formatted correctly with \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\" lines at the beginning of each question/answer block, and that there are no extra spaces or newlines before these lines. If this isn't the case, you may need to modify the function slightly to better handle this situation.","status":200,"tokens":[398,459],"elapsed":4.303526105,"_type":"aimessage"}]
