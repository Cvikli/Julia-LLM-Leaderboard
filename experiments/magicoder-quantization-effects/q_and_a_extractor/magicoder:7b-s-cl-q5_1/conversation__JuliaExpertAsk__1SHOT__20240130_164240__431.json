It then iterates through each line in the list, checking if it starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`. If so, it sets flags to indicate that we're currently reading those sections and removes any leading spaces from subsequent lines. If a line doesn't start with space and is within a Question or Answer section, it adds the text to the appropriate section (after removing the leading spaces). Finally, it returns the extracted question and answer stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.","status":200,"tokens":[0,331],"elapsed":2.976210033,"_type":"aimessage"}]
