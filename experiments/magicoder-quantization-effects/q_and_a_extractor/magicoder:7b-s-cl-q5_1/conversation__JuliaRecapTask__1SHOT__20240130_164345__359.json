[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you could solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question *= chomp(split(line, \" # Question\")[2])\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer *= chomp(split(line, \" # Answer\")[2])\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the markdown text into lines and then iterating over each line. If a line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it removes that prefix and adds the rest of the line to either the question or answer string. The chomp function is used to remove any leading spaces. \n\nFor example, if you call `q_and_a_extractor(\"\"\"\n# Question\n    What is the capital of France?\n# Answer\n    Paris\n\"\"\")`, it would return `(question=\"What is the capital of France?\", answer=\"Paris\")`. Note that this function assumes each question and answer is on a separate line, separated by blank lines if necessary. It also does not handle nested sections within the Question or Answer, so multiple level questions/answers will be treated as part of the same section.","status":200,"tokens":[0,319],"elapsed":2.93690704,"_type":"aimessage"}]
