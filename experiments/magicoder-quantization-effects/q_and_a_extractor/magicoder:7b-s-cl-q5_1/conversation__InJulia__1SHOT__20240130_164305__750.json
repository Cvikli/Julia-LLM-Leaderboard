[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can use regular expressions (`Regex`) to find patterns in strings. Here's an example of how this could be done:\n\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)::Tuple{String, String}\n    question = collect(eachmatch(r\"# Question\\n([^\\n]+)\", md))\n    answer = collect(eachmatch(r\"# Answer\\n([^\\n]+)\", md))\n\n    return (strip.(question), strip.(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function works by using regular expressions to find all instances of the strings `\"# Question\"` and `\"# Answer\"` followed by some text. The `collect` function is used to convert the match objects returned by eachmatch into an array, which is then passed to `strip` for leading spaces and newlines to be removed from each string. The function returns a tuple containing arrays of the stripped question and answer texts.\n\nNote that this assumes that there will always be one and only one question and answer block in your markdown text and that the text doesn't contain any other instances of `\"# Question\"` or `\"# Answer\"`. If these assumptions aren't true, you may need to adjust this code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,277],"elapsed":2.488372427,"_type":"aimessage"}]
