[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia function to solve this problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question *= line[13:end] # to remove \"# Question\" at the beginning of the line\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer *= line[10:end] # to remove \"# Answer\" at the beginning of the line\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function `q_and_a_extractor` splits the input string `md` into lines and then iterates over each line. If a line starts with `# Question`, it appends the rest of the line to the variable `question`. Similarly, if a line starts with `# Answer`, it appends the rest of the line to the `answer` variable. The `strip` function is used to remove any leading spaces or newlines from the text.\n\nThis function can be tested using the following code:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n# Answer\\nThe capital of France is Paris.\"\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md)) # should print (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\nYou can replace `md` with any markdown formatted text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,349],"elapsed":3.156957812,"_type":"aimessage"}]
