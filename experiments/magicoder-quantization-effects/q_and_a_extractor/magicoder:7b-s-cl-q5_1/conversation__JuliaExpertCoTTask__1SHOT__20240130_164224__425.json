If a line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it changes the `inQuestion` and `inAnswer` flags and continues to the next line without doing anything else. Otherwise, if `inQuestion == true`, it appends the line to question (excluding \"# Question\"), and if `inAnswer == true`, it appends the line to answer (excluding \"# Answer\"). Finally, after iterating through all lines, it returns a tuple of stripped strings: the question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,359],"elapsed":3.258708775,"_type":"aimessage"}]
