[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can do it using regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    in_question, in_answer = false, false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_question && !startswith(line, \" \")\n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif in_answer && !startswith(line, \" \")\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a string `md` that represents the markdown text and splits it into an array of lines. It then iterates over each line in the markdown. If it finds a line starting with `\"# Question\"`, it sets a flag to indicate that we're in the question section and continues to the next line. Similarly, if it sees a line starting with `\"# Answer\"`, it changes the flag to indicate that we're in the answer section and continues to the next line. \n\nIf we find a line that isn't indented (`!startswith(line, \" \")`) and we're currently collecting question or answer text, we append the stripped version of this line to our `question` or `answer` strings. This is done by using `strip(line)` which removes any leading spaces from the line.\n\nFinally, it returns a tuple with the extracted question and answer strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,393],"elapsed":3.534912977,"_type":"aimessage"}]
