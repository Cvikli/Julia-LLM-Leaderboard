Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

If a line starts with `# Question`, it removes that part of the string and any leading spaces and newlines, and adds the result to `question`. Similarly for `# Answer` and `answer`. It then returns both question and answer as a tuple.\n  \nExample usage: \n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question 1\nThis is a question?\n# Answer 1\nYes, this is an answer.\n# Question 2\nWhat's the second question?\n# Answer 2\nThat's not the right answer.\n\"\"\"\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md)) # prints (\"Thisis a question?\",\"Yes,this is an answer.\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,320],"elapsed":2.876796403,"_type":"aimessage"}]
