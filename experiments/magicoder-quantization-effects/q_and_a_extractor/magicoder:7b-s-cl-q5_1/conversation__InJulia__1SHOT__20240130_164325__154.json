[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use the `each_line` function to iterate over each line of your markdown text, and use an inner variable to keep track of whether you're currently in a question or answer section. Here is how:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_q_section = false\n    in_a_section = false\n\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        stripped_line = strip(line)\n        if startswith(stripped_line, \"# Question\")\n            in_q_section = true\n        elseif startswith(stripped_line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_a_section = true\n        end\n        \n        if in_q_section && !startswith(stripped_line, \"# Answer\")\n            question *= stripped_line\n        elseif in_a_section\n            answer *= stripped_line\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each line of the markdown. If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\", it switches to collecting question text. Similarly, if it encounters a line starting with \"# Answer\", it switches to collecting answer text. Any lines not falling into these categories are added to either the question or answer string, depending on whether we're currently in a question or an answer section.\n\nThis function assumes that markdown sections always start and end on newlines (i.e., each line is preceded by `# `). If your markdown text might have some lines starting with `#` but not followed by a space, you may need to adjust the code accordingly. \n\nYou can call this function like so:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n    # Question\n        This is a question?\n         Yes it is!\n    # Answer\n        This is an answer.\n\"\"\"\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md))\n```\nThis will print: \n`(\"This is a question?\\n         Yes it is!\", \"This is an answer.\")`","status":200,"tokens":[0,486],"elapsed":4.383285874,"_type":"aimessage"}]
