[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem using Julia's regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    \n    for line in split(md, '\\n')\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_question && endswith(line, \"##\")\n            question *= line[1:end-2] # remove trailing '#'\n            in_question = false\n        elseif in_answer && endswith(line, \"##\")\n            answer *= line[1:end-2] # remove trailing '#'\n            in_answer = false\n        end\n        \n        if in_question \n            question *= line\n        elseif in_answer \n            answer *= line\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer)) # strip leading/trailing whitespace\nend\n```\nThis function splits the markdown text by newline characters, and then iterates over each line. If a line starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`, it sets the corresponding flag to true. If the flag is true, it appends the stripped non-'##'-ending part of the current line to the appropriate variable (`question` or `answer`). If it encounters another section marker (another `#`), it stops collecting from that section until it sees a new section marker.","status":200,"tokens":[0,370],"elapsed":3.318881349,"_type":"aimessage"}]
