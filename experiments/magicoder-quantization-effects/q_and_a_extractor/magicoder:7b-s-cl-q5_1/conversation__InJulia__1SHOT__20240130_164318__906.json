[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use the `eachmatch()` function to iterate over all matching patterns in your markdown text. Then, check for lines that start with '# Question' or '# Answer' and add them into a question/answer array. Here is an example:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = []\n    answer = []\n\n    for line in lines \n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            append!(question, split(line[12:end], \" \"))\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            append!(answer, split(line[9:end], \" \"))\n        end\n    end\n\n    return join(question), join(answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the markdown text into lines, then iterating over each line. If a line starts with \"# Question\", it removes the \"# Question\" part and adds the remaining string to the question array after splitting it on spaces (to remove any extra characters). The same process is repeated for \"# Answer\". At the end, it returns the joined strings of the question and answer arrays. \n\nPlease note that this function will not handle nested questions/answers or more complex markdown structures correctly. For a fully featured solution, you would need to use a library such as `Markdown.jl` which is capable of parsing and rendering markdown properly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,319],"elapsed":2.858194229,"_type":"aimessage"}]
