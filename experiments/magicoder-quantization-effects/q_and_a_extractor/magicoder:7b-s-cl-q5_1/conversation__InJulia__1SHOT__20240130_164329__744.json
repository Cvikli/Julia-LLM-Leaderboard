[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function written in Julia that will extract all the text from the Markdown sections called \"Question\" and \"Answer\":\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)::Tuple{String, String}\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question *= chomp(line[endof(\"# Question\"):end])\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer *= chomp(line[endof(\"# Answer\"):end])\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function splits the input `md` into individual lines using the `\\n` character as a delimiter. It then iterates over each line and if a line starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`, it extracts the relevant text and adds it to the question or answer string respectively. The chomp() function is used to remove any leading spaces or newlines from the extracted texts.\n\nPlease note that the function assumes that there are no nested \"Question\" and \"Answer\" sections. Also, if a line doesn't start with `# Question` or `# Answer`, it will be ignored. If you want to handle these scenarios differently, you would need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,305],"elapsed":2.737845046,"_type":"aimessage"}]
