If a line starts with \"# Question\", it appends the rest of the line (without the leading spaces or newline) to `question`. If a line starts with \"# Answer\", it does the same for `answer`. Finally, it returns a tuple of `question` and `answer`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,228],"elapsed":2.073399072,"_type":"aimessage"}]
