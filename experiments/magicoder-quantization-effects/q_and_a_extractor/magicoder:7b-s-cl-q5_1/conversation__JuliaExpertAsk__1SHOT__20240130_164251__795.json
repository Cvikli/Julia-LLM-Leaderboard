Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is one way to implement this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            continue\n        elseif in_question && !startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            question *= ltrim(rstrip(line))\n        end\n        \n        if startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        elseif in_answer && !startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            answer *= ltrim(rstrip(line))\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the input string into lines and iterating over each line. When it finds a line starting with \"# Question\", it knows to start capturing the question text, and when it finds one starting with \"# Answer\", it knows to start capturing the answer text. It then concatenates all relevant text to the respective variables `question` or `answer`.\n\nPlease note that if you have more than two questions in your markdown file or if a section is not marked as Question or Answer, this code might not work as expected. \n\nThis function assumes that each question and answer section starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", followed by optional spaces/newlines and then the text of the respective section. If there are additional lines before the actual question or answer start, it won't capture them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,373],"elapsed":3.363275171,"_type":"aimessage"}]
