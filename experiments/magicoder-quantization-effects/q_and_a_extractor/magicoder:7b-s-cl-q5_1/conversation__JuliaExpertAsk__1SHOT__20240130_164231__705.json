Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple Python script that does this:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = re.search('# Question(.*?)(?=#|\\n)', md, re.DOTALL | re.IGNORECASE)\n    answer = re.search('# Answer(.*?)(?=#|\\n)', md, re.DOTALL | re.IGNORECASE)\n    \n    if question:\n        question = question.group(1).strip()\n        \n    if answer:\n        answer = answer.group(1).strip()\n    \n    return (question,answer)\n```\nThe function `q_and_a_extractor` uses regular expressions to find the text between `# Question` and either a new `#` or the end of the string (denoted by `\\n`), then it strips leading spaces and newline characters. It also handles the possibility that there might not be an Answer section.\n\nRemember, in Markdown, headers (like `#`) indicate the start of a new section. So, if your markdown text doesn't have these sections, the function will return `None` for the corresponding part.","status":200,"tokens":[0,266],"elapsed":2.399942747,"_type":"aimessage"}]
