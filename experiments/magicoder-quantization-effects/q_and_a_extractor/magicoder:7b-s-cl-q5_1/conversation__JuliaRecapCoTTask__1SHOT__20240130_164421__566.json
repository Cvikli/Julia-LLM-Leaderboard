[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

When it encounters a line that starts with \"## \", \"### \", etc., it knows it's at the start of a section. If this is the Answer section (`\"Answer\"`), then it continues and waits for the next section; if it's the Question section, it stores the current line as the question and continues. It also checks whether it's in the middle of processing the answer or question sections by checking whether the current line isn't blank before adding it to the appropriate variable.\n\nYou should be aware that this function assumes that a markdown file follows a strict pattern: each question is followed directly by its corresponding answer, and there are no other sections between them (like an introductory or conclusion paragraph). If your input format could vary, you'd need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,415],"elapsed":3.830538129,"_type":"aimessage"}]
