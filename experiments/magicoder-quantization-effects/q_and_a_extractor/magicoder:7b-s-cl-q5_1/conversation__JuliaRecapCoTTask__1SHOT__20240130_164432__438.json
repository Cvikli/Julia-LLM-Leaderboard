[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible solution written in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    section = \"\"\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            section = \"question\"\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            section = \"answer\"\n        elseif section == \"question\" && !isempty(line) && !startswith(line, \"# \")\n            question *= line[2:end]\n        elseif section == \"answer\" && !isempty(line) && !startswith(line, \"# \")\n            answer *= line[2:end]\n        end\n    end\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThe function `q_and_a_extractor` works by iterating through each line of the given markdown text. If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\", it sets the section variable to \"question\". Similarly, if it encounters a line that starts with \"# Answer\", it sets the section variable to \"answer\".\nThen for all other lines:\n- If the section is \"question\" and the line does not start with \"# \", it appends the text of the line (excluding the initial \"# \") to the question.\n- If the section is \"answer\" and the line does not start with \"# \", it appends the text of the line (excluding the initial \"# \") to the answer. \nFinally, it returns a tuple of stripped versions of both the question and the answer.\n\nThe Special Instructions are not used in this solution. If you wanted to use them, you would need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,397],"elapsed":3.653394455,"_type":"aimessage"}]
