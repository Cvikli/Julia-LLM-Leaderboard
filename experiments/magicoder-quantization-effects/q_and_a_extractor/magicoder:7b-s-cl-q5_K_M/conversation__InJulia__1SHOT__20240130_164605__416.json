[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example implementation of `q_and_a_extractor`:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    reading_question = false\n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            reading_question = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\") && reading_question == true\n            reading_question = false\n        end\n        \n        if reading_question\n            question *= strip(replace(line[end]))  # replace() replaces '# Question' or '# Answer' with nothing\n        elseif line != \"\"\n            answer *= strip(replace(line[end]))\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each line of the input string `md`. If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\", it sets a flag `reading_question` to true, and for any subsequent lines that don't start with \"# Answer\" but are not empty (i.e., they contain actual text), it appends them to `question`. Conversely, if it encounters a line starting with \"# Answer\", it unsets the flag `reading_question`, and again any subsequent non-empty lines are added to `answer`. The function finally returns a tuple `(strip(question), strip(answer))`, where `strip()` is used to remove leading spaces and newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,340],"elapsed":2.973516572,"_type":"aimessage"}]
