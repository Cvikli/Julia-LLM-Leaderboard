It will only append to `question` or `answer` when it has encountered the `# Question` or `# Answer` tags respectively. If you call the function with your markdown string as input, it will return a tuple of strings `(question,answer)`.\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes that there is exactly one `# Question` and one `# Answer` tag in the given markdown string. If there are multiple sections or if they aren't in the right order or don't exist at all, you may need to adjust it accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,431],"elapsed":3.797678873,"_type":"aimessage"}]
