[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible solution to your problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nimport Markdown\nimport Base64: decode\nusing StringEncodings: StringDecoder, UTF8\n\nfunction extract_text(md::String)\n    dec = StringDecoder()\n    text = Markdown.parse(md)\n    lines = split(text, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestion = false\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestion = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inQuestion = false\n        elseif inQuestion && !isempty(line)\n            question *= strip(decode(\"utf-8\", dec, line))\n        elseif !inQuestion && !isempty(line)\n            answer *= strip(decode(\"utf-8\", dec, line))\n        end\n    end\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n\n# Testing the function\nmd = \"\"\"\nThis is a sample Markdown text.\n\n# Question 1\nWhat is your name?\n\n# Answer 1\nMy name is Julia.\n\"\"\"\nprintln(extract_text(md)) # should print (\"What is your name?\", \"My name is Julia.\")\n```\n\nIn this solution, we're using the `Markdown` package in Julia to parse the markdown text and extract the relevant parts. The function `extract_text` iterates over each line of the text, checking if it starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If so, it toggles a boolean variable `inQuestion`. For any lines that come after an `# Answer`, we know they must be part of the answer because we're not in a question section anymore.\n\nPlease note this solution assumes the markdown text is correctly formatted. If there are multiple questions/answers and additional formatting may change things, you would need to adjust accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,429],"elapsed":3.876655876,"_type":"aimessage"}]
