It extracts the text between these pairs, strips leading spaces and newlines, converts it to plain text (using `split()`), and appends it to either the list of questions or answers depending on its position in the document. Finally, it returns a tuple containing two lists: one for each question-answer pair found.","status":200,"tokens":[0,567],"elapsed":5.033810434,"_type":"aimessage"}]
