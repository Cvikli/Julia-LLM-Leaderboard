[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here's an example of how you might solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString) \n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestionBlock = false\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\") && !inQuestionBlock\n            inQuestionBlock = true\n            continue\n        end\n        if startswith(line, \"# Answer\") && inQuestionBlock\n            inQuestionBlock = false\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if inQuestionBlock\n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif !inQuestionBlock\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function splits the input string `md` into a list of lines and iterates over each line. If the line starts with \"# Question\" and we're not currently in a question block, it marks us as being in a question block and continues to the next line. Similarly, if a line starts with \"# Answer\" and we are in a question block, it marks us as no longer being in a question block and continues to the next line. If we're in a question block, it appends the stripped line of text to our `question` string; otherwise, it appends the stripped line of text to our `answer` string. Finally, it returns both `question` and `answer`. \n\nThis function assumes that there is only one \"Question\" section and one \"Answer\" section in your markdown, separated by those lines starting with \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\", respectively. If you have multiple sections of either type, or they are not properly delimited like this, the output will be incorrect.","status":200,"tokens":[0,403],"elapsed":3.629247602,"_type":"aimessage"}]
