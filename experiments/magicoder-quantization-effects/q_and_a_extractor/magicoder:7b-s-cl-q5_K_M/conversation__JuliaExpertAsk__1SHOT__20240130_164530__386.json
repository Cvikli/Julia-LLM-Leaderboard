For example:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(md)) # prints (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,330],"elapsed":2.904052692,"_type":"aimessage"}]
