[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might write such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')  # Split the string into lines.\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    extracting_question, extracting_answer = false, false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            extracting_question = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            extracting_question = false\n            extracting_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if extracting_question && !isempty(line)\n            question *= line[end-length(line)+2:end]  # Add the text without leading spaces and newlines.\n        elseif extracting_answer && !isempty(line)\n            answer *= line[end-length(line)+2:end]  # Add the text without leading spaces and newlines.\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function `q_and_a_extractor` splits the given markdown string into lines using `\\n` as a delimiter. Then it iterates over these lines. If the current line starts with `# Question`, it sets `extracting_question` to true and continues. Similarly, if the current line starts with `# Answer`, it sets `extracting_answer` to true and continues. When it encounters a line that does not start with either `# Question` or `# Answer`, it checks whether we are currently extracting question or answer text. If so, it appends the relevant part of the line to the corresponding variable after stripping any leading spaces and newlines. Finally, it returns the extracted question and answer as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,403],"elapsed":3.633853538,"_type":"aimessage"}]
