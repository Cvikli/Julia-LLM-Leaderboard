Then it goes through each line and checks if the line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If it does, it switches to the corresponding part of the tuple and adds the content stripped from leading spaces and newlines to that part. It stops when there is an empty line (which could be in between paragraphs).\nPlease note that this function assumes that every `# Question` or `# Answer` section ends with a line containing only the `# Question` or `# Answer`, no other text after that. If your markdown has additional sections you might want to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,374],"elapsed":3.313162623,"_type":"aimessage"}]
