[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might do this:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestion = false\n    inAnswer = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestion = true\n            continue\n        elseif inQuestion && !startswith(line, \"## \") \n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inAnswer = true\n            continue\n        elseif inAnswer && !startswith(line, \"## \")\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function first splits the markdown into lines. It then loops through each line. If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\", it sets `inQuestion` to true and continues to the next line. This is so that we don't accidentally add this as part of the question. Similarly for \"# Answer\". Once these flags are set, any lines following these directives (but not subsequent directives) are added to the current section until another directive is encountered. The `strip` function is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from each line before it's appended to the relevant variable.\nFinally, the extracted question and answer are returned in a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[98,326],"elapsed":2.899873642,"_type":"aimessage"}]
