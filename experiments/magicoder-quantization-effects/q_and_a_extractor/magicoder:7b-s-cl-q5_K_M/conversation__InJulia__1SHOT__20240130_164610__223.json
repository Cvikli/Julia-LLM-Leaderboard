[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of your request:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_q = false\n    in_a = false\n    \n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        stripped = rstrip(line)\n        \n        if startswith(stripped, \"# Question\")\n            in_q = true\n        elseif startswith(stripped, \"# Answer\")\n            in_a = true\n        end\n        \n        if in_q && isempty(question)\n            question *= stripped[13:end] # Remove '# Question '\n        end\n        \n        if in_a && isempty(answer)\n            answer *= stripped[12:end] # Remove '# Answer '\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each line of the input `md` string. If a line starts with \"# Question\", it sets `in_q = true`, and if a line starts with \"# Answer\", it sets `in_a = true`. Then, for each line that is within a question or an answer section (i.e., `in_q == true || in_a == true`), it appends the stripped line to the corresponding variable (`question` or `answer`). The results are returned as a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that `# Question` and `# Answer` sections do not span multiple lines. If they could, you would need additional logic to handle that case.","status":200,"tokens":[0,364],"elapsed":3.19450931,"_type":"aimessage"}]
