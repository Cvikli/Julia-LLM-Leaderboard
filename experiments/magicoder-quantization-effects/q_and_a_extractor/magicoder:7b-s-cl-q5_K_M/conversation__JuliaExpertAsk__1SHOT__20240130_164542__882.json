Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can write this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")  # Split string into an array of strings by newlines\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question = strip(replace(line[13:end], \" \" => \"\"))  # replace leading spaces with nothing and strip newlines\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer = strip(replace(line[10:end], \" \" => \"\"))\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each line in the input `md`. If a line starts with `# Question`, it extracts the text following this and stores it as `question`. If a line starts with `# Answer`, it extracts the text following this and stores it as `answer`. It uses `startswith` to check if a line matches these patterns. The `replace` function is used to remove any leading spaces from the extracted text, and `strip` is used to remove newlines.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the markdown file contains only one `# Question` section followed by one `# Answer` section. If there are multiple sections or if they aren't in the correct order, you may need to adjust the logic of the loop or use a more sophisticated approach such as using regular expressions to match and extract the relevant text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,344],"elapsed":3.024971253,"_type":"aimessage"}]
