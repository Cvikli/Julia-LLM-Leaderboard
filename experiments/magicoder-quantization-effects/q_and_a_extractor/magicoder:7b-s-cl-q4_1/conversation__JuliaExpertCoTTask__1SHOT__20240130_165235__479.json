It then iterates through these lines and checks if each line starts with `\"# Question\"` or `\"# Answer\"`. If it does, it extracts the text following that marker and strips any leading spaces or newlines. The extracted text is then used to form either the question or answer.\n\nFor continuations of a question/answer, it treats the next lines as part of the previous section, appending them with a newline character (`\"\\n\"`). This allows the function to handle multi-line questions and answers. \n\nFinally, when it has found both the question and answer, it returns these in a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,446],"elapsed":3.635826679,"_type":"aimessage"}]
