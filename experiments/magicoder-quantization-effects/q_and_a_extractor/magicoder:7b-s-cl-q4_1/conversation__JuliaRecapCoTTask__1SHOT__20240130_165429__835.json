[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, you would first need to parse the markdown formatted text. There are many libraries available in Julia for parsing markdown, such as `Documenter.julia`, which is specifically designed for building and publishing documentation. You can also use regex or `Makie` package for processing strings. \n\nHere's a possible solution using Documenter:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    md = Markdown.parse(md, flavor = :github)\n    \n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    inQuestionSection, inAnswerSection = false, false \n\n    for block in md.content\n        if typeof(block) == Markdown.Header && block.level == 1 && startswith(block.text[1], \"# Question\")\n            inQuestionSection = true\n        elseif typeof(block) == Markdown.Header && block.level == 1 && startswith(block.text[1], \"# Answer\")\n            inAnswerSection = true\n        elseif typeof(block) == Markdown.Paragraph && inQuestionSection\n            question *= replace(string(block.content), \"\\n\", \" \")\n            inQuestionSection = false\n        elseif typeof(block) == Markdown.Paragraph && inAnswerSection\n            answer *= replace(string(block.content), \"\\n\", \" \")\n            inAnswerSection = false\n        end\n    end\n\n    return strip(question), strip(answer)\nend\n```\nYou can call this function by passing your markdown text like so: `q_and_a_extractor(\"## Question\\nThis is the question.\\n\\n ## Answer\\n This is the answer.\")`.\n\nThe solution assumes that there are exactly two header blocks, one for each section. If there can be more or less sections, you would need to adjust the code accordingly. \n\nRemember to always strip leading and trailing spaces from the question and answer strings, as they might have been indented in the markdown text due to the Markdown syntax. The `strip` function does exactly that.","status":200,"tokens":[0,473],"elapsed":3.999125123,"_type":"aimessage"}]
