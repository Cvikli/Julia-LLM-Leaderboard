The `.group(1)` gets the first and only sub-match in the pattern. If no `# Answer` is found in the text, it returns None. If there's no `# Question`, the answer will be returned with an empty question.\n  \nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no nested sections (i.e., a section cannot start and end within another section). Also, it considers every character after `# Answer` to belong to the answer until it encounters `# Question`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,300],"elapsed":2.409628397,"_type":"aimessage"}]
