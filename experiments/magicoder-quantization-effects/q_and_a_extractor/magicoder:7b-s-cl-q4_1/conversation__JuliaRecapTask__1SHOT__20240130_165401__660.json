[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here's how you could implement this using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\") \n            question *= replace(line[10:end], \" \"*new -> \"\") # remove leading spaces and newline\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer *= replace(line[9:end], \" \"*new -> \"\")  \n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we split the markdown into lines and then check each line for a question or an answer. If it is, we append that part of the markdown to `question` or `answer`. \n\nPlease note that this assumes that the text in each section (question or answer) does not itself contain `# Question` or `# Answer`. This may need adjusting depending on what exactly you want to do with such nested sections.","status":200,"tokens":[0,245],"elapsed":2.0096145,"_type":"aimessage"}]
