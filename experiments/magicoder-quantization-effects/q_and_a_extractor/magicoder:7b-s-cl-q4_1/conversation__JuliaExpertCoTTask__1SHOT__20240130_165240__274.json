Then it loops through these lines and checks if they are start with `# Question` or `# Answer`. If so, it changes the `section` variable accordingly. If not, but we're in a question/answer section, it appends that line to our current question/answer string.\n\nYou can call this function as follows:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md)) # => (\"What is the capital of France?\",\"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,359],"elapsed":2.948079474,"_type":"aimessage"}]
