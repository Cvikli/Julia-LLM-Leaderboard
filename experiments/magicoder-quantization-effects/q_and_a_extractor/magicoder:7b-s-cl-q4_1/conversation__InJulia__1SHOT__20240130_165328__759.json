[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might do this using regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = join(matchall(r\"# Question(.*?)# Answer\", md).map((x) -> strip(x)), \"\\n\")\n    answer   = match(r\"# Answer(.*)\", md)[1] |> first |> strip\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `matchall` function to find all blocks of text between `# Question` and `# Answer`. The `map` function is then used to remove leading spaces and newlines from each block. The final result is a tuple of the question and answer. Note that this assumes the markdown always starts with a `# Question` line, and ends with an `# Answer` line. It might not work correctly if there are other headers in your text or if the headers don't start and end a block.","status":200,"tokens":[0,209],"elapsed":1.665745324,"_type":"aimessage"}]
