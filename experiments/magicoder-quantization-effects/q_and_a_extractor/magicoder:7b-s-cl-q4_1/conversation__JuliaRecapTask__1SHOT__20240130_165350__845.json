[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can do this:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    blocks = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    for block in blocks\n        if startswith(block, \"# Question\")\n            block = chomp(block[12:end])\n            question *= block\n        elseif startswith(block, \"# Answer\")\n            block = chomp(block[9:end])\n            answer *= block\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nIn this code, we first split the input markdown string into blocks by each line. Then we check each block to see if it starts with either \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If so, we strip those parts from the beginning and concatenate them to our `question` and `answer` variables accordingly. We use `chomp` to remove any extra whitespace at the end of lines that could mess up our concatenation process.\n\nPlease note: This function assumes that there is only one question followed by an answer per markdown block, and that there's always a newline after each \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". The behavior may be unpredictable if these assumptions aren't met in the input. If you need to handle more complex scenarios, this function could be adjusted accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[398,309],"elapsed":2.611480307,"_type":"aimessage"}]
