It then removes leading spaces and newlines from these strings before returning them as a tuple. If either the question or answer isn't found, it returns a message indicating that. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes each markdown section contains only one paragraph of text. If there can be multiple paragraphs, you may need to adjust the regular expression to match those cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,294],"elapsed":2.395885043,"_type":"aimessage"}]
