[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could write this function. We will use `eachline` to read through each line of the markdown, check if it's a question or answer section and concatenate them accordingly. \n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestionSection = false\n    lines = split(strip(md), \"\\n\")\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestionSection = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inQuestionSection = false\n        elseif inQuestionSection\n            question *= line[end] == \" \" ? line[2:end] : line[1:end] # remove leading space if exists\n        else\n            answer *= line[end] == \" \" ? line[2:end] : line[1:end] # remove leading space if exists\n        end\n    end\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nIn the above code:\n- The `startswith` function checks whether a string starts with a given substring.\n- We iterate over each line of the markdown.\n- If we encounter a line starting with \"# Question\", we set `inQuestionSection` to true and start accumulating question text, removing any leading space.\n- Similarly for lines starting with \"# Answer\".\n- All other lines are accumulated in `answer` or `question`, depending on the current state of `inQuestionSection`.\n- The function returns a tuple `(question, answer)`. \n\nPlease replace {{instructions}} with specific instructions if you have them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,369],"elapsed":3.078765696,"_type":"aimessage"}]
