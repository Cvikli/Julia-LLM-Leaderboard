[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Here's how you would go about extracting the question and answer from a markdown formatted text:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\") \n            in_question = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"## \")\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_question \n            question *= line[3:end]\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= line[3:end]\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function reads through each line of the markdown text, and if it is a question or an answer, starts appending lines to either `question` or `answer`. The `[3:end]` operation on the string gets rid of the first three characters (the \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", which is removed by the continues) and any leading spaces.\n\nFinally, we use the `strip` function to remove any extra whitespace at the beginning or end of the strings.\n\nThis script assumes that each question is separated from its answer by another header line starting with \"## \", as in a Markdown file. If your questions/answers are formatted differently, you may need to modify the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,386],"elapsed":3.217158369,"_type":"aimessage"}]
