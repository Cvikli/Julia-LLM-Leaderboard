[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

You can then strip any leading spaces or newline characters from the text using the `strip` function in Julia. Here is a simple solution for your problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question = r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n# Answer\"s\n    answer = r\"# Answer\\n(.*?)\\n(?=# Question|$)\";\n    mq, ma = match(question, md), match(answer, md);\n    \n    # Check if the pattern was found in the markdown string.\n    if !isnothing(mq) && !isnothing(ma) \n        return (strip(mq[1]), strip(ma[1]))\n    elseif isnothing(mq) && isnothing(ma)\n        throw(ErrorException(\"No question or answer found.\"))\n    elseif isnothing(mq) \n        throw(ErrorException(\"No question found.\"))\n    elseif isnothing(ma)\n        throw(ErrorException(\"No answer found.\"))\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function returns the extracted question and answer, stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. If the markdown string does not contain both a Question and an Answer section, it throws an `ErrorException`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,305],"elapsed":2.491660919,"_type":"aimessage"}]
