[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise.

Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you might write this function:\n```python\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    lines = md.split(\"\\n\")\n    for line in lines:\n        if line.startswith(\"# Question\"):\n            question += \" \" + line[len(\"# Question\"):].strip()\n        elif line.startswith(\"# Answer\"):\n            answer += \" \" + line[len(\"# Answer\"):].strip()\n            \n    return (question,answer)\n```\nThis function reads the input markdown string and processes it line by line. If a line starts with \"# Question\", it appends the rest of the line to `question` after stripping leading spaces. If a line starts with \"# Answer\", it does the same for `answer`. It continues this until both `question` and `answer` are filled. Finally, it returns the answers in a tuple. \n\nHere's an example usage:\n```python\nmd = \"\"\"# Question\nThis is the question?\n\n# Answer\nThis is the answer!\n\"\"\"\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(md)) # Outputs: ('This is the question?', 'This is the answer!')\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,279],"elapsed":2.224056595,"_type":"aimessage"}]
