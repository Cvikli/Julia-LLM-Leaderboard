[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem using Julia's built-in `read` function to read the markdown file as a string. Then, use regular expressions (`r\"...\"` in Julia) and string manipulation functions like `match`, `split`, and `strip` to extract the question and answer sections from the text. Finally, return the question and answer as a tuple. Here is an example of how you might implement this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    m = match(r\"# Question(.*?)\\n# Answer\", md, start=1)\n    if m == nothing \n        return \"The markdown file does not contain a question and answer pair.\"\n    end\n    question = strip(m[1])\n    answer = strip(matchall(r\"(?<=\\# Answer)(.*?)(?=\\n\\#)\", md)[1])\n    \n    if isempty(question) || isempty(answer) \n        return \"The markdown file does not contain a complete question and answer pair.\"\n    end\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function first tries to find the question and answer sections in the markdown string using regular expressions. If it finds the sections, it strips leading spaces and newlines from both sections. Then it checks if either section is empty - if either section is empty, it returns a corresponding error message. Otherwise, it returns the question and answer as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[11,322],"elapsed":2.642911562,"_type":"aimessage"}]
