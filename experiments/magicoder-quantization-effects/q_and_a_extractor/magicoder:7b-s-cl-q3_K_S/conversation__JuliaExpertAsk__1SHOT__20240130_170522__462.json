The first string is the extracted question, stripped of leading spaces and newlines. The second string is the extracted answer, also stripped from leading spaces and newlines. If there are no questions or answers found in the input text, an empty string will be returned instead. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there should only be one question and one answer per markdown text. For cases with multiple sections of each type, you would need a more sophisticated approach to handle such cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,388],"elapsed":3.090990246,"_type":"aimessage"}]
