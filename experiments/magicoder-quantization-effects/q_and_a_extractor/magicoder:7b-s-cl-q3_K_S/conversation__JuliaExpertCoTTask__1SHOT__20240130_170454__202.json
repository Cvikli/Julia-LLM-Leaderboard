Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function in Julia that fulfills your specifications:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    section = \"\"\n\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\", keepempty=false)\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            section = :Question\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            section = :Answer\n        elseif !isempty(line) && section == :Question\n            question *= chomp(line)\n        elseif !isempty(line) && section == :Answer\n            answer *= chomp(line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return question, answer\nend\n```\nThis function splits the input string by newline character and processes each line. If a line starts with `# Question`, it changes the `section` variable to `:Question`. If a line starts with `# Answer`, it changes the `section` variable to `:Answer`. Any other lines are appended to either the question or answer text, depending on which section the previous line was in (with leading spaces removed using `chomp()`). When both sections have been processed, the function returns them as a tuple.\n\nNote that this function assumes there's only one `# Question` and `# Answer`, without any additional lines between them. If your input string can contain multiple such blocks, you might need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[272,321],"elapsed":12.403834976,"_type":"aimessage"}]
