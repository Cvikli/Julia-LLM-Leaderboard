[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how this function might look:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    \n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            continue \n        elseif in_question && startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n            continue \n        elseif in_answer && !isempty(line)\n            answer *= line[end-2:end] * \"\\n\"\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_question || in_answer\n            if startswith(line, \"    \")\n                line = line[5:end]  # remove leading spaces\n            end\n            (in_question ? question : answer) *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function splits the input markdown text by lines, then for each line it checks if we are in a question or an answer section based on whether the line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If we are in a question/answer section and the line does not start with \"    \", it is considered part of the current section. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes all questions end with two spaces followed by a newline character, and answers also end with two spaces but without any newline characters afterwards. Also, it strips leading and trailing whitespace from both question and answer texts before returning them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,372],"elapsed":2.967000832,"_type":"aimessage"}]
