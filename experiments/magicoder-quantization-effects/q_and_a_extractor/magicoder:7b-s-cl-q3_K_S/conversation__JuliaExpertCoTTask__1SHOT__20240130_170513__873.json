It then checks each line to see if it's either a question or an answer by checking whether the line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If it is, the corresponding variable (`question` or `answer`) is updated with the stripped line. Note that `strip(line)` removes any leading spaces and newlines from the input string.\n\nWhen all lines have been processed, the function returns a tuple of strings representing the question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,267],"elapsed":2.122271009,"_type":"aimessage"}]
