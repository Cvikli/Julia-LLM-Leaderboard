Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple Python script that could solve this problem:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = None\n    answer = None\n\n    lines = md.split('\\n')\n    for i, line in enumerate(lines):\n        if line.strip().startswith(\"# Question\"):\n            question_started = True\n            question = ''\n        elif line.strip().startswith(\"# Answer\"):\n            answer_started = True\n            answer = ''\n        elif question_started:\n            if not answer_started:\n                question += line.lstrip() + '\\n'\n            else:\n                break\n        elif answer_started:\n            answer += line.lstrip() + '\\n'\n            \n    return (question, answer)\n```\nIn this code, we split the input markdown string into lines and scan each line to see if it starts with either \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If it does, we append the stripped content of that line to question or answer respectively. We break when we reach a line starting with \"# Answer\", because after that there's no more \"question\" or \"answer\", only other sections in the markdown file. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes the input is correctly formatted, i.e., a line starting with \"# Question\" is followed by lines of content for the question (until it encounters another section start), and so on for answer. If your Markdown text doesn't have the correct format, you may need to pre-process or validate the inputs to this function before calling it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,357],"elapsed":2.849679752,"_type":"aimessage"}]
