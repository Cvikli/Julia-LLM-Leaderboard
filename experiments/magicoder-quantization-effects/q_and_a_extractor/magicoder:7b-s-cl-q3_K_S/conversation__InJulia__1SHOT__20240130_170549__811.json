[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, you can use regular expressions in Julia to extract the required data. Here is how you might implement such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question = chomp(chomp(line)[end+1:])\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer = chomp(chomp(line)[end+1:])\n        end \n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nIn this function, we split the given string into lines using the newline character '\\n'. Then for each line we check if it starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If it does then we extract the remaining text and remove any leading spaces and newlines from it. We store these extracted texts in `question` and `answer` respectively and finally return a tuple of `question` and `answer`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,237],"elapsed":1.866288861,"_type":"aimessage"}]
