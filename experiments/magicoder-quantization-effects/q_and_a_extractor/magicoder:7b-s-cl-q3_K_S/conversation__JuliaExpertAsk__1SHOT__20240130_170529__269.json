[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise.

Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you can write this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if line == \"# Question\" && !in_question && !in_answer\n            in_question = true\n        elseif line == \"# Answer\" && !in_answer && in_question\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n        elseif in_question\n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the input string `md` into lines and then going through each line. If it encounters a \"# Question\" line while not already in a question or an answer section, it starts collecting text for the question. Similarly, if it encounters a \"# Answer\" line while not in an answer section but is already in a question section, it switches to collecting answers. All other lines are added to the current block of either questions or answers. The function returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer strings.\n\nNote: This function assumes that the input `md` adheres to the stated format i.e., the question and answer are separated by `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively, with no other `#` being present in between these sections.","status":200,"tokens":[0,351],"elapsed":2.779678498,"_type":"aimessage"}]
