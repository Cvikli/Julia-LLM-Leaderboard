If it is, then it removes the leading part (`\"# Question\"` and `\"# Answer\"`) and any extra spaces to give you the question or answer. \n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n    # Question What is your name?\n    My name is Julia.\n    # Answer Hello Julia, nice to meet you!\n\"\"\"\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(md))\n```","status":200,"tokens":[98,261],"elapsed":2.091525676,"_type":"aimessage"}]
