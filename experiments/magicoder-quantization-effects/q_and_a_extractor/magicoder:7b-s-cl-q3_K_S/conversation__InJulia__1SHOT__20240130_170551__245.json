Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of the problem using regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = match(r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n# Answer\", md, seed=1).captures[1]\n    answer = match(r\"# Answer\\n(.*?)\\n###\", md, seed=2).captures[1]\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function first tries to find the section of text where Question and Answer sections start by matching a string that starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`, followed by any characters until it finds another such header. It then captures and returns these two sections after stripping leading spaces and newlines.\n\nPlease note that this is quite simplified, and does not consider nested headers or other edge cases in your Markdown text. Depending on the structure of your markdown, you may need to adjust the regular expressions or create a more complex function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,226],"elapsed":1.804294589,"_type":"aimessage"}]
