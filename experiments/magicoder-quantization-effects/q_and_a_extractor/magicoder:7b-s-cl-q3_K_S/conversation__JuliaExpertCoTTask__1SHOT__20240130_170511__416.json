Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple Python solution for your problem:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = re.findall(r'\\n# Question\\n(.*?)\\n# Answer', md, re.DOTALL)\n    answer = re.findall(r'\\n# Answer\\n(.*?)\\n# ', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    return (question[0].strip(), answer[0].strip())\n```\nThe function `q_and_a_extractor` uses regular expressions (`re`) to extract the sections of text between `# Question` and `# Answer`, and then it strips any leading spaces or newlines from those extracted strings. The function returns these two strings as a tuple `(question, answer)`. \n\nThis function assumes that every markdown section starting with \"# Question\" will have a corresponding section starting with \"# Answer\". If this is not the case, the function may behave unexpectedly and return None or raise an exception.\n\nTo test your code, you can run it like this:\n```python\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\"))  # Should print ('What is the capital of France?', 'The capital of France is Paris.')\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,299],"elapsed":2.373116898,"_type":"aimessage"}]
