[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

It then iterates over these strings and checks if they start with `\"# Question\"` or `\"# Answer\"`. If it finds a line that starts this way, it strips away the leading spaces and newlines using `strip(chomp(line[12:end]))` (or for answer, `strip(chomp(line[10:end]))`), then stores that as either question or answer depending on whether it's a question line or an answer line. When it finds both the question and answer lines, it stops scanning the rest of the input string to prevent assigning the same data twice to two different variables. Once it has found both, it returns the question and answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,350],"elapsed":2.732551156,"_type":"aimessage"}]
