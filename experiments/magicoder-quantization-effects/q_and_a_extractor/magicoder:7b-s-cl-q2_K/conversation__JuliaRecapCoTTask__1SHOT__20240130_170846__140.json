[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The problem can be solved by using Python's `re` library to find patterns that start with `# Question` and `# Answer`, followed by extracting all text in between. \n\nHere is a possible solution:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = re.findall(r'# Question(.*?)(?=\\n# Answer)', md, re.DOTALL)[0].strip() \n    answer = re.findall(r'# Answer(.*)', md, re.DOTALL)[0].strip() \n    return question, answer\n```\n\nThis function first finds all text following `# Question` and before `# Answer`, then after `# Answer`. Note that we use the `re.DOTALL` flag to make `.` match any character including new lines (by default, it will not do so). Afterwards, we strip leading spaces using the `strip()` method.\n\nLet's test this function with a given markdown:\n\n```python\nmd = \"\"\"# Question\nThis is the question...\n# Answer\nThis is the answer...\"\"\"\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(md))  # Output: ('This is the question...', 'This is the answer...')\n```","status":200,"tokens":[11,284],"elapsed":2.233329613,"_type":"aimessage"}]
