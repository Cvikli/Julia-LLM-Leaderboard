If a line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it toggles a flag to indicate whether we are in either section. Any subsequent text lines will be appended to the question or answer strings, after stripping leading spaces and newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,307],"elapsed":2.314215788,"_type":"aimessage"}]
