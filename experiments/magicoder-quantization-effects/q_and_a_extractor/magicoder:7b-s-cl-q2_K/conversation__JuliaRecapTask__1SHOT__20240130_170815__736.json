[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is one way to write this function using Julia's string manipulation functions:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    q = strip(split(md, \"# Question\")[2])\n    a = strip(split(md, \"# Answer\")[2])\n    return (q,a)\nend\n```\nIn this function, `split(md, \"# Question\")` splits the markdown string into two parts at every occurrence of `# Question`. The second part is then stripped for leading spaces and newlines with `strip()`.\n\nSimilarly, it does the same thing for the answer (`# Answer`) section.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that each question ends with a single line break (since markdown syntax interprets two or more consecutive line breaks as the end of a paragraph), similarly applies to answers. If your markdown format deviates from these assumptions, you might have to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[398,212],"elapsed":1.698105729,"_type":"aimessage"}]
