[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can implement this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # split the markdown string into sections based on header lines\n    sections = [x for x in split(md, '\\n# ')]\n    \n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    for section in sections\n        if startswith(section, \"Question\") \n            question = strip(split(section, \"\\n\")[2]) # grab the second line of this section which contains the actual text\n        elseif startswith(section, \"Answer\")\n            answer = strip(split(section, \"\\n\")[2]) # grab the second line of this section which contains the actual text\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function first splits the markdown string into sections based on the `# Question` and `# Answer` headers. Then it loops through each section. If a section starts with \"Question\", it will strip any leading spaces and newline characters from this section to obtain the question text. Similarly, if a section starts with \"Answer\", it will extract the answer text. The function returns these two texts in a tuple `(question,answer)`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,275],"elapsed":2.074497382,"_type":"aimessage"}]
