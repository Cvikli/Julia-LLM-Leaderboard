[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can solve this problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question *= strip(line[10:end])\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\") \n            answer *= strip(line[8:end])\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nThis function iterates through each line of the markdown string. If a line starts with `# Question`, it extracts the text and appends it to question. Same process is done for lines starting with `# Answer`. The result is returned as a tuple `(question, answer)`. \n\nYou can test this function on your markdown strings like so:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nThis is my question?\n\n# Answer\nThis is my answer!\n\"\"\"\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(md)) # should return (\"This is my question?\",\"This is my answer!\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,268],"elapsed":2.088134594,"_type":"aimessage"}]
