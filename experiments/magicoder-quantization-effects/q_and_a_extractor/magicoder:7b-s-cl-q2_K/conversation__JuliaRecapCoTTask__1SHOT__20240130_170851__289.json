[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a way to solve this task using Julia's standard libraries and its strong typing system:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the string into lines\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    \n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inAnswer = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inAnswer = false\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inAnswer = true\n        elseif inAnswer && !isempty(line)\n            answer *= line[end-1] == '\\n' ? line[2:end] : line\n        elseif !inAnswer && !isempty(line)\n            question *= line[end-1] == '\\n' ? line[2:end] : line\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThe function `q_and_a_extractor` goes through each line of the markdown string. When it sees a line starting with \"# Question\", it knows that all subsequent lines are part of the question. Similarly for \"# Answer\". Any other line is considered a continuation of the current section (either question or answer). The function only adds to `question` when we're in the question section and similarly for `answer`. \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes there won't be any unintended spaces or tabs at the beginning of lines, which might cause misinterpretation. It is always a good practice to preprocess your data before feeding it into machine learning models.","status":200,"tokens":[0,365],"elapsed":2.850269216,"_type":"aimessage"}]
