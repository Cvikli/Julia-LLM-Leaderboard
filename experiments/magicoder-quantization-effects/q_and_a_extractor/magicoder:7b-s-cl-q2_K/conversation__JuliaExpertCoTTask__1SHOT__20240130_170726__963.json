Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem using Python with the help of `re` module which provides support for regular expressions in python.\n\n```python\nimport re\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = re.findall(r'# Question\\n(.*?)\\n# Answer', md, re.DOTALL)\n    answer = re.findall(r'# Answer\\n(.*?)(?=\\n# Question|\\n# Answer|$)', md, re.DOTALL)\n    return (question[0].strip(), answer[0].strip()) if question and answer else (\"\",\"\")\n```\n\nThis function uses `re` module's `findall()` method to extract the text between `# Question` and an end of line or the next `# Question`/`# Answer`. The text is matched using a regular expression, which ensures that we consider only lines between `# Question` and `# Answer` for question text. Similarly, for answer text.\n\nThe extracted texts are stripped from leading spaces and newlines using the `strip()` method and returned as a tuple. If no question or answer is found, empty string is returned in place of missing section.","status":200,"tokens":[0,257],"elapsed":1.976838872,"_type":"aimessage"}]
