Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

If it does, it sets a flag indicating that this section is currently being read. Then, depending on whether this is the question or answer section, it either appends the line to the question variable (if it's in the question section) or the answer variable (if it's in the answer section). The function then returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer strings stripped of any leading spaces and newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,283],"elapsed":2.129593386,"_type":"aimessage"}]
