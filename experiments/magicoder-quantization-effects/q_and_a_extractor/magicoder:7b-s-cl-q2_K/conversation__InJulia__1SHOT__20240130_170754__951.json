Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Python solution using the `re` module to extract the desired sections:\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = re.findall(r'\\n# Question\\n(.*?)\\n# Answer', md, re.DOTALL)\n    answer = re.findall(r'\\n# Answer\\n(.*?)(?=\\n# Question|$)', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # Remove leading spaces and newlines\n    question = [q.lstrip(' \\t\\n') for q in question]\n    answer = [a.lstrip(' \\t\\n') for a in answer]\n    \n    return (question[0], answer[0]) if question and answer else (None, None)\n```\nThis function first uses `re.findall` to search for all text within the `# Question` and `# Answer` sections. Then it uses list comprehension along with string manipulation functions (`lstrip`) to remove leading spaces and newlines from each section of text found by `re.findall`. The function returns a tuple of the first question (if exists) and answer (if exists), or `(None, None)` if no question or answer is found in the markdown text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,283],"elapsed":2.133385516,"_type":"aimessage"}]
