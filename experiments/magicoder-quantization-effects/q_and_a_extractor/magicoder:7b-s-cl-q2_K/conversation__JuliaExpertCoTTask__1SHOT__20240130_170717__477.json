Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem by using the python markdown module that supports extracting information from markdown text. Here's how you can approach it:\n\n```python\nimport markdown\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    sections = [x[1].strip() for x in markdown.markdown(md).split(\"Answer\") if x[0] == \"# Answer\"]\n    answer = sections[0][len(\"# Answer\"):].strip()\n    \n    question_start = md.find(\"Question\")\n    if question_start != -1:\n        question = md[question_start:md.find(\"\\n\", question_start)].replace(\"# Question\",\"\").strip()\n    else:\n        question = \"No Question found in the Markdown\"\n    \n    return (question, answer)\n\n# Test with sample data\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n\\n# Answer\\nThe capital of France is Paris.\"))\n```\n\nThis function first splits the markdown text on the \"Answer\" section to get all the question and answers, then it trims any leading spaces or newlines. It then extracts the last part as the answer and everything before that as the question. If a question cannot be found in the markdown, it defaults to returning a statement indicating no question was found.\n\nNote: This function assumes that each question has exactly one corresponding answer. In case of multiple answers, this function will only consider the last one. Also, this function doesn't handle cases where there is more than one set of \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,363],"elapsed":2.810554043,"_type":"aimessage"}]
