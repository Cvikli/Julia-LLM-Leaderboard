The `(?s)` flag makes the `.` in the regex match any character, including newline. \n\nThe extracted text is then stripped of leading spaces and newlines using the strip() method before being returned as a tuple. If either the question or answer section does not exist or there are multiple questions or answers, this function will return None to indicate that it was unable to produce a valid output.","status":200,"tokens":[0,246],"elapsed":1.874018402,"_type":"aimessage"}]
