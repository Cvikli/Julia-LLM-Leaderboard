The `re.DOTALL` flag tells Python's regular expression engine to match any character, including a newline.\n\nThe `.strip()` method is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes there will be exactly one question and answer in your markdown string. If there could be multiple questions or answers, you would need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,214],"elapsed":1.794311729,"_type":"aimessage"}]
