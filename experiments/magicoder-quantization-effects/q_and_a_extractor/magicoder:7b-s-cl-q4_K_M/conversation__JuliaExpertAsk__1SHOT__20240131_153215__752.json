Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem using Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = re.findall(r'# Question(.*?)(?=\\n*# Answer|\\Z)', md, re.DOTALL|re.MULTILINE)\n    answer = re.findall(r'# Answer(.*?)(?=\\n*# Question|\\Z)', md, re.DOTALL|re.MULTILINE)\n    \n    # Strip leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text\n    question = [q.strip() for q in question] if question else None\n    answer = [a.strip() for a in answer] if answer else None\n    \n    return (question, answer)\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to match the sections of markdown text that start with `# Question` and `# Answer`. The `re.DOTALL|re.MULTILINE` flags allow the `.` character to match any character at all, including newline characters, and `(?=\\n*# Question|\\Z)` and `(?=\\n*# Answer|\\Z)` are lookahead assertions that ensure we only capture text up until the next `# Question` or `# Answer`.\n\nThe extracted text is then stripped of leading spaces and newlines using list comprehension. If there are no matches for either question or answer, None will be returned in their place.","status":200,"tokens":[0,323],"elapsed":2.566984658,"_type":"aimessage"}]
