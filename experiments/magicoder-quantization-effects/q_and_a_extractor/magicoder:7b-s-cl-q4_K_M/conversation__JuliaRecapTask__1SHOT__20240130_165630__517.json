[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could solve this task using Julia's string manipulation functions:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestionSection = false\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestionSection = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inQuestionSection = false\n        elseif inQuestionSection && !isempty(line)\n            question *= line[end:end]  # append to end of previous line if not empty\n        elseif !inQuestionSection && !isempty(line)\n            answer *= line[end:end]    # append to end of previous line if not empty\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))  # remove leading/trailing whitespaces\nend\n```\nThis function iterates through each line of the markdown text. If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\", it switches to collecting question texts. Similarly, if it encounters a line that starts with \"# Answer\", it switches to collecting answer texts. Otherwise, it continues to accumulate the current section's text. After finishing iterating through all lines, it returns the extracted questions and answers stripped of leading/trailing whitespaces.","status":200,"tokens":[0,321],"elapsed":2.715535242,"_type":"aimessage"}]
