[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise.

Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution using regular expressions:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = None\n    answer = None\n    \n    for line in md.split('\\n'):\n        if line.strip().startswith('# Question'):\n            question = re.sub('^#* ', '', line[len('# Question'):].lstrip())\n        elif line.strip().startswith('# Answer'):\n            answer = re.sub('^#* ', '', line[len('# Answer'):].lstrip())\n            \n    return (question,answer)\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating through each line of the markdown text. If a line starts with `# Question` or `#Answer`, it removes those prefixes and any leading spaces from that line, then assigns the result to `question` or `answer`. The function finally returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that each question is followed by an answer without any other sections in between. If there could be other sections (like additional information about the question), you would need a more complex approach to handle those cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,253],"elapsed":2.103725105,"_type":"aimessage"}]
