[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise.

Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could solve this problem using Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = ''\n    answer = ''\n    \n    lines = md.split('\\n')\n    for line in lines:\n        if line.startswith('# Question'):\n            question += line[len('# Question'):].strip() + ' '\n        elif line.startswith('# Answer'):\n            answer += line[len('# Answer'):].strip() \n            \n    return (question,answer)\n```\nThis function splits the markdown text into lines and checks each line if it starts with '# Question' or '# Answer'. If a line matches this pattern, it strips leading spaces/newlines from that line and appends it to either `question` or `answer`. The result is a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes the markdown text has been properly formatted. For instance, it assumes there's only one `# Question` and one `# Answer` in the text, and they are not nested within each other. If you want to handle such situations more robustly (like handling multiple questions/answers or nested ones), you would need a more sophisticated parser.","status":200,"tokens":[0,275],"elapsed":2.186050468,"_type":"aimessage"}]
