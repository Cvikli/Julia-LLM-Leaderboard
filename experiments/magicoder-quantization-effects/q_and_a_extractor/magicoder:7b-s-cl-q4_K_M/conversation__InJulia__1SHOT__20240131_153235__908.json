Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

Then it goes through each line one by one, and if the line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it changes the current section to either \"question\" or \"answer\". If the current section is \"question\" and the line is not empty (i.e., it's a non-empty line in the question section), it appends the line to `question`. Similarly, if the current section is \"answer\", and the line is not empty, it appends the line to `answer`. After going through all lines, it returns the extracted question and answer stripped of leading spaces and newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,344],"elapsed":2.729633938,"_type":"aimessage"}]
