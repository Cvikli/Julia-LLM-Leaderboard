[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is an example of how you can extract text between `# Question` and `# Answer` lines using regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = match(r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n# Answer\", md, capture=true)[1]\n    answer = match(r\"# Answer\\n(.*?)\\n# End of Answer\", md, capture=true)[1]\n    \n    # strip leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text\n    question = replace(question, r\"^[ \\t]*\\n\" => \"\") \n    answer = replace(answer, r\"^[ \\t]*\\n\" => \"\")\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses `RegularExpressions.jl` to find the text between `# Question` and `# Answer`, and then removes any leading spaces or newlines from the found text using the `replace()` function. Note that if your markdown doesn't follow exactly this format, you might need to adjust the regular expressions accordingly.\n\nPlease ensure that the function `q_and_a_extractor` is called with a string argument that contains both `# Question` and `# Answer`. If not, it will return an error or unexpected behavior.","status":200,"tokens":[0,294],"elapsed":2.338102875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
