The `strip` function removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string. \n\nPlease note that this function does not handle nested or multi-line sections well and assumes that each section begins on a new line (i.e., it treats `# Question` as starting a new question, even if the previous one hasn't finished). \n\nIf you need to handle these scenarios, you would need a more sophisticated parsing approach.","status":200,"tokens":[0,370],"elapsed":2.998838504,"_type":"aimessage"}]
