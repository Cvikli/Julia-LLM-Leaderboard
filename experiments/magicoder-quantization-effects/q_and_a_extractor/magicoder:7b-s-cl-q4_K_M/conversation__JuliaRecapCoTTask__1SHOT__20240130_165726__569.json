[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use the `split` function to split the string into sections based on lines starting with `#`. Then process each section separately. Here is how you might write such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    sections = split(md, \"\\n# \")  # Split markdown text by lines starting with '#'\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    for section in sections\n        if startswith(section, \"Question\")\n            question = strip(split(section, \": \")[2])\n        elseif startswith(section, \"Answer\")\n            answer = strip(split(section, \": \")[2])\n        end\n    end\n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nThis function `q_and_a_extractor` splits the markdown text into sections based on lines starting with `#`. It then iterates over these sections. If a section starts with `\"Question\"`, it extracts the question from that section by splitting at `: ` and taking the second element (index 1 in array). It then strips any leading or trailing whitespace from this extracted text using the `strip` function.\n\nIf a section starts with `\"Answer\"`, it does the same to extract the answer from the section, but again it takes the second element of the split string. After extracting both the question and answer, it returns them as a tuple. \n\nNote that if there are no sections starting with \"Question\" or \"Answer\", this function will return an empty string for either of these values. It also assumes that any text after `: ` is part of the question/answer. If there can be other lines starting with `#` before the question and answer sections, you would need a more sophisticated method to identify those as well.","status":200,"tokens":[0,391],"elapsed":3.262807771,"_type":"aimessage"}]
