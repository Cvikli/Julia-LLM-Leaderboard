[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example solution using Julia's regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question = match(r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n## Answer\", md, re.DOTSTAR).captures[1]\n    answer = match(r\"## Answer\\n(.*)\", md, re.DOTSTAR).captures[1]\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to match the question and answer sections in the markdown text. The `match` function returns a Match object which has a `captures` field containing an array of all matched substrings. The `.` in the regular expression means any character, and `*` means zero or more of the preceding element.\n\nThe `strip` function is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that there will be exactly one question and answer section in the markdown text. If there could be multiple sections, you would need a different approach, possibly involving parsing the markdown with a library like Parsers.jl or Markdown.jl.","status":200,"tokens":[0,260],"elapsed":2.189613737,"_type":"aimessage"}]
