Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Python function that should do this:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    pattern = r'(# Question)(.*?)(# Answer)(.*?)(\\n|$)'  # matches both sections\n    \n    match = re.findall(pattern, md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    if len(match) == 0:\n        return None  # no match found\n    \n    question = ' '.join(match[0][1].split('\\n'))  # strip leading spaces and newline characters\n    answer = ' '.join(match[0][3].split('\\n'))    # strip leading spaces and newline characters\n    \n    return (question.strip(), answer.strip())\n```\n\nThis function uses the `re` module to find all matches of the pattern in the markdown text. The `.*` is a wildcard that will match any character (except for a newline), and the `?` makes it non-greedy, so it stops at the first instance of `# Answer` or the end of the string.\n\nThe `re.DOTALL` flag allows the dot to match all characters, including newlines, which is important because markdown typically doesn't treat a newline as significant in its text.\n\nFinally, we use the `strip()` function to remove leading spaces and newlines from each section of the text before returning them in a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,318],"elapsed":2.561694336,"_type":"aimessage"}]
