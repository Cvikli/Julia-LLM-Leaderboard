[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can use the `mdparse` package to extract sections from markdown formatted text:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\nimport mdparse\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    doc = parse_md(md)\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    for block in doc.content\n        if isa(block, Heading) && block.level == 1 && startswith(block.text, \"Question\")\n            question = strip(block.children[1].string)\n        elseif isa(block, Heading) && block.level == 1 && startswith(block.text, \"Answer\")\n            answer = strip(block.children[1].string)\n        end\n    end\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function parses the markdown text into a `Document` object using the `parse_md` function from the mdparse package. It then iterates over each block in the document content. If it encounters a heading with level 1 and starts with \"Question\", it extracts the text following the heading, strips any leading spaces or newlines, and assigns it to the `question` variable. Similarly, if it encounters a heading with level 1 and starts with \"Answer\", it extracts the text following the heading, strips any leading spaces or newlines, and assigns it to the `answer` variable. It finally returns these two variables as a tuple.\n\nPlease ensure that you have installed the necessary package using Pkg.add(\"mdparse\") in your Julia environment before running this function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,359],"elapsed":2.939987052,"_type":"aimessage"}]
