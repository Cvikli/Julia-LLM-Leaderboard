Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here's a simple approach to solve this task in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\") \n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\") \n            continue\n        elseif isempty(question) && !isempty(line)\n            question = strip(replace(line, r\"^# \" => \"\"))\n        elseif !isempty(answer) && !isempty(line)\n            answer *= \" \" * strip(replace(line, r\"^# \" => \"\")) \n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the input markdown `md` into lines. Then it goes through each line to check whether it is part of question or answer section. It also checks if it's not already started a new section, and then strips any leading spaces and newlines from extracted text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,253],"elapsed":2.042459526,"_type":"aimessage"}]
