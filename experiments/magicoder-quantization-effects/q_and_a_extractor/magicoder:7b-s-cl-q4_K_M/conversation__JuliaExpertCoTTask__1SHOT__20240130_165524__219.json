Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this task:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            while !isempty(lines[1]) && lines[1][1] == ' '\n                popfirst!(lines)\n            end\n            question = join(lines, \" \")\n            break\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            while !isempty(lines[1]) && lines[1][1] == ' '\n                popfirst!(lines)\n            end\n            answer = join(lines, \" \")\n            break\n        end\n    end\n    \n    question = replace(question, \"# Question\" => \"\")\n    answer = replace(answer, \"# Answer\" => \"\")\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThe function `q_and_a_extractor` splits the input markdown text into lines and iterates over them. When it encounters a line that starts with `# Question`, it captures all subsequent lines as the question until an empty line is encountered (since sections are usually separated by blank lines). Similarly, when it encounters a line that starts with `# Answer`, it captures all subsequent lines as the answer. It then removes the section headers from the captured text and returns the question and answer as a tuple.\n\nLet's test this function with your provided data:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n\\n# Answer\\nThe capital of France is Paris.\"\n@assert q_and_a_extractor(md) == (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,415],"elapsed":3.41191877,"_type":"aimessage"}]
