Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple Python solution using regular expressions:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    pattern = r'# Question(.*?)# Answer(.*)'\n    match = re.search(pattern, md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    if match is not None:\n        question = match.group(1).strip()\n        answer = match.group(2).strip()\n        \n        return (question, answer)\n    else:\n        return \"No question and answer found in the input.\"\n```\n\nThis function firstly uses a regular expression pattern to find the sections with the 'Question' and 'Answer'. The `re.DOTALL` flag is used so that `.` matches any character including newlines. \n\nIf a match is found, the groups contain the text from the question section and answer section respectively. These are stripped of leading spaces and newlines using the `strip()` method before being returned as a tuple. If no match was found, an error message is returned.\n\nLet's test it with your given data:\n\n```python\nmd = \"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n# Answer\\nThe capital of France is Paris.\"\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(md))  # Outputs: ('What is the capital of France?', 'The capital of France is Paris.')\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,313],"elapsed":2.545514402,"_type":"aimessage"}]
