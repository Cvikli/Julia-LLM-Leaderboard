The `re.DOTALL` flag allows `.` to match any character, including a newline. The `.lstrip()` method is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\nThis function assumes that there will be exactly one question and one answer in the input markdown string, and it returns these as separate strings in a tuple. If this assumption does not hold, the function may need to be modified accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,241],"elapsed":1.914345745,"_type":"aimessage"}]
