[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function that accomplishes this task using regular expressions to match the sections:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Extract Question and Answer sections\n    question = match(r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n# Answer\", md, re\"s\")\n    answer = match(r\"# Answer\\n(.*)\", md, re\"s\")\n    \n    if question === nothing || answer === nothing\n        return nothing\n    end\n    \n    # Strip leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text\n    question_text = replace(question.captures[1], r\"^[\\t ]*\" => \"\")\n    answer_text = replace(answer.captures[1], r\"^[\\t ]*\" => \"\")\n    \n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `match` function from Julia's Regex module to find matches in the markdown text. The regular expressions used are:\n- `# Question\\n(.*?)\\n# Answer`: This regex matches the question section of the markdown. It starts with \"# Question\" and ends with \"# Answer\". The `.*?` is a non-greedy match, meaning it will stop matching as soon as possible to avoid capturing everything until the end of the string.\n- `# Answer\\n(.*)`: This regex matches the answer section of the markdown. It starts with \"# Answer\" and ends at the end of the string. The `(.*)` is a greedy match, meaning it will capture all text up to the end of the string.\n\nThe `replace` function is used to strip any leading spaces or newlines from the matched sections.","status":200,"tokens":[0,382],"elapsed":3.204711613,"_type":"aimessage"}]
