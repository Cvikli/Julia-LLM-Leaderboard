Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of `q_and_a_extractor` function that will solve your problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n        else\n            if in_question && !isempty(strip(line))\n                question *= strip(line)\n            elseif in_answer && !isempty(strip(line))\n                answer *= strip(line)\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function splits the markdown text into lines and iterates over each line. If a line starts with \"# Question\", it sets `in_question` to true and if it starts with \"# Answer\", it sets `in_answer` to true. It then appends the stripped version of the line to either `question` or `answer` depending on whether we are currently in a question or an answer section.\n\nNote: This function assumes that there is only one `# Question` and one `# Answer` in the markdown text, and ignores any other lines that might start with these prefixes. If your markdown can contain multiple questions and answers, you would need to modify this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,349],"elapsed":2.779997861,"_type":"aimessage"}]
