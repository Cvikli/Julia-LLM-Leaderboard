[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can implement this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(strip(md), '\\n')\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    in_question, in_answer = false, false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_question && !isempty(line)\n            question *= strip(line[2:end])\n        elseif in_answer && !isempty(line)\n            answer *= strip(line[2:end])\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function splits the markdown text into lines and iterates over each line. If it encounters a line starting with \"# Question\", it starts recording the question. Similarly, if it encounters a line starting with \"# Answer\", it starts recording the answer. Any leading spaces or newlines are removed from these sections before concatenating them to the respective strings.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is only one `# Question` and one `# Answer` in the markdown text, and that they are not nested within other sections. If your markdown can have multiple questions and answers, or if they can be nested, you would need a more complex solution to handle these cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,346],"elapsed":2.762929631,"_type":"aimessage"}]
