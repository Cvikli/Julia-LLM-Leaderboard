Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple way to extract this information using Python with its built-in markdown library:\n\n```python\nimport re\nfrom markdown import Markdown\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    md = re.sub(\"^ +\", \"\", md, flags=re.MULTILINE)  # remove leading spaces\n    md = re.sub(\"\\n+\", \"\\n\", md)  # remove extra newlines\n\n    lines = md.split('\\n')\n    \n    question = None\n    answer = None\n    \n    for line in lines:\n        if line.strip().startswith('# Question'):\n            question = ''\n        elif line.strip().startswith('# Answer'):\n            answer = ''\n        elif question is not None:\n            question += line + '\\n'\n        elif answer is not None:\n            answer += line + '\\n'\n            \n    return (question.strip(), answer.strip()) if question and answer else (\"\", \"\")\n\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n# Answer\\nThe capital of France is Paris.\"))\n```\nThis function works by looping through each line in the markdown text, checking for lines starting with '# Question' and '# Answer', and adding any subsequent lines to a question or answer variable until it encounters another header. It then returns these two pieces of information as a tuple. \n\nPlease note that this code will not work correctly if there are multiple questions/answers in the markdown text, as it assumes each section starts with '# Question' and ends with '# Answer'. If you have different formats, you would need to adjust this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,376],"elapsed":3.027383664,"_type":"aimessage"}]
