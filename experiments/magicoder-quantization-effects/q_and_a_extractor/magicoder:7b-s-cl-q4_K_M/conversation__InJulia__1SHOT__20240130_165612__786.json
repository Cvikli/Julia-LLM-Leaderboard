[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of `q_and_a_extractor` function in Julia using regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = match(r\"# Question\\n(.*?)(?=\\n# Answer)\", md, re\"s\").captures[1]\n    answer = match(r\"# Answer\\n(.*?)(\\n##|\\Z)\", md, re\"s\").captures[1]\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `match` and `captures` functions of Julia's Regular Expressions package. The regular expressions used here are:\n\n- `# Question\\n(.*?)` is used to capture the text between the lines \"# Question\" and the next line. \n\n- `(?=\\n# Answer)` is a positive lookahead assertion, which ensures that we match only until the immediate following \"\\n# Answer\".\n\n- `# Answer\\n(.*?)(\\n##|\\Z)` is used to capture the text between \"# Answer\" and either an empty line (\"\\n\") or end of string (\"\\Z\"). \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there's only one instance of each section in `md`. If your markdown can contain multiple sections, you should adjust the regular expressions accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,298],"elapsed":2.421212595,"_type":"aimessage"}]
