When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestionSection = false\n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestionSection = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inQuestionSection = false\n        elseif inQuestionSection && !isempty(strip(line))\n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif !inQuestionSection && !isempty(strip(line))\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each line of the input markdown string. If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\", it switches into question-collecting mode. Similarly, if it encounters a line that starts with \"# Answer\", it switches into answer-collecting mode. In both modes, it strips leading spaces and newlines from the collected text before appending it to `question` or `answer`. After collecting all lines in the question or answer section, it returns them as a tuple.\n\nYou can test this function with your provided data like so:\n\n```julia\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"))  # Outputs: (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,362],"elapsed":2.910985587,"_type":"aimessage"}]
