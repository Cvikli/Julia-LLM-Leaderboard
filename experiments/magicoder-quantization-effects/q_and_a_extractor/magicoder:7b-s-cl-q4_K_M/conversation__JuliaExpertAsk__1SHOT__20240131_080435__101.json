The `re.DOTALL` flag allows the dot `.` in the regular expression to match any character, including a newline. \n\nThen it strips leading spaces and newlines from each extracted section using list comprehension. Finally, it returns the question and answer as a tuple. If no question or answer is found, it returns None.","status":200,"tokens":[0,238],"elapsed":1.984281317,"_type":"aimessage"}]
