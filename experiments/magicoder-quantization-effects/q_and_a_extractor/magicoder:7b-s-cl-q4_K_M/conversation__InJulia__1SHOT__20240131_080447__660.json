[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can implement this function using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question = replace(line[13:end], \" \"*x => \" \")\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer = replace(line[10:end], \" \"*x => \" \")\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nThis function splits the markdown text into lines and checks each line to see if it starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`. If a line matches one of these patterns, it extracts all characters following those patterns. The `replace()` function is used to remove any leading spaces from the extracted text. Finally, it returns the question and answer as a tuple.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that each section (question and answer) is on its own line with no extra whitespace or other characters before or after `# Question` or `# Answer`. If your markdown has different formatting, you would need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[98,276],"elapsed":2.249693334,"_type":"aimessage"}]
