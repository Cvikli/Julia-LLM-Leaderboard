[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could implement this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\") \n            in_question = true\n            continue\n        end\n        if in_question && !startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            question *= strip(line) * '\\n'\n        end\n        if startswith(line, \"# Answer\") \n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        if in_answer && !startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            answer *= strip(line) * '\\n'\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each line of the markdown. If a line starts with `# Question`, it marks that we are in a question and continues to the next line without adding anything to `question`. Similarly for lines starting with `# Answer`. If a line is neither of these, and we are currently in a question or an answer (as indicated by `in_question` and `in_answer`), then it adds stripped version of that line to the current section. At the end of this function, `question` holds all text for the question and `answer` holds all text for the answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,332],"elapsed":2.669476415,"_type":"aimessage"}]
