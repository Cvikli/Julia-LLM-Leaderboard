It then extracts the text between these lines and removes any leading spaces or newlines. The extracted question and answer are returned as a tuple. \n\nPlease note that this assumes that there will only be one `# Question` and one `# Answer` in your markdown string. If you have multiple questions and answers, you would need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,256],"elapsed":2.033599779,"_type":"aimessage"}]
