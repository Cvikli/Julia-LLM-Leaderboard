Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you can accomplish this using Python's built-in `re` (Regular Expression) library:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question_match = re.search(r'\\n# Question(.*?)\\n', md, re.DOTALL)\n    answer_match = re.search(r'\\n# Answer(.*?)\\n', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    if question_match and answer_match:\n        return (question_match.group(1).strip(), answer_match.group(1).strip())\n    else:\n        return (\"No Question found\", \"No Answer found\")\n```\nIn this function, `re.DOTALL` is a flag that makes the dot in the regular expression match any character (including newline), and `.*?` matches any number of any characters (non-greedy) up to the first occurrence of what follows it. The `strip()` method removes leading spaces and newlines from each extracted text.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```python\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nThis is a question section with multiple lines.\n    Indented text also should be handled.\n# Answer\nThis is an answer section with multiple lines as well.\n    Again, indentation is important to be preserved. \n\"\"\"\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(md))  # ('This is a question section with multiple lines.\\n    Indented text also should be handled.', 'This is an answer section with multiple lines as well.\\n    Again, indentation is important to be preserved.')\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,369],"elapsed":2.998272455,"_type":"aimessage"}]
