[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you might implement this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestionSection = false\n    inAnswerSection = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestionSection = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inAnswerSection = true\n        elseif inQuestionSection\n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif inAnswerSection\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each line of the input markdown `md`. If a line starts with \"# Question\", it sets a flag to indicate that we are in the question section. If a line starts with \"# Answer\", it sets a different flag to indicate that we are in the answer section. Any other lines that are encountered while in either section are appended to their respective variables (after stripping any leading whitespace or newline characters). After processing all lines, the function returns a tuple containing the question and answer sections of the markdown.","status":200,"tokens":[0,276],"elapsed":2.222326522,"_type":"aimessage"}]
