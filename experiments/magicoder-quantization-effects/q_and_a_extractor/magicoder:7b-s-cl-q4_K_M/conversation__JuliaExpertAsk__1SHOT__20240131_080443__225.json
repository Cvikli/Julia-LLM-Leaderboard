The `re.DOTALL` flag is used so that `.` matches any character, including a newline. \n\nThe extracted texts are then stripped of leading spaces and newlines using the `strip()` method and the `sub()` function from the `re` module.\n\nFinally, the function returns a tuple containing the question and answer.
