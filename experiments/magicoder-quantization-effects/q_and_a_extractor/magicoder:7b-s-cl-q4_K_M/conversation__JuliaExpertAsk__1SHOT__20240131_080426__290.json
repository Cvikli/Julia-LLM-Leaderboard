The `re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE` flags are used to make `.` match any character including newline, and `^` and `$` match start and end of a line respectively. \n\nThe extracted text is then stripped of leading spaces and newlines using the `strip()` method and regular expressions again (`re.sub('\\n|\\s{2,}',' ', ...)`). The function returns the question and answer as a tuple. If no questions or answers are found, it will return None.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes there is only one question and answer in the markdown text. If there can be multiple questions/answers, you would need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,367],"elapsed":3.068339245,"_type":"aimessage"}]
