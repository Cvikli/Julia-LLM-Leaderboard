Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you might write this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestionSection = false\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestionSection = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inQuestionSection = false\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if inQuestionSection\n            question *= strip(line)\n        else\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function splits the markdown string into lines and then iterates over each line. If it encounters a line starting with \"# Question\", it sets `inQuestionSection` to true. If it encounters a line starting with \"# Answer\", it sets `inQuestionSection` to false. Any other lines are added to either the question or answer string depending on whether we're currently in the question section. Finally, when we've processed all lines, it returns the extracted question and answer strings as a tuple.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is exactly one \"Question\" section followed by one \"Answer\" section. If your markdown can have multiple sections or no sections at all, you would need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,323],"elapsed":2.56961614,"_type":"aimessage"}]
