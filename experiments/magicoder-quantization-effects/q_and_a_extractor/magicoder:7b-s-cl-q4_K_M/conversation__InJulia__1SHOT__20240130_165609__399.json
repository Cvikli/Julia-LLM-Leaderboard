[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might achieve this using Julia's Regex module:\n```julia\nusing README_checklist.md\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = matchall(\"^# Question\\\\n(.*?)(?=^# Answer)\", md, 1)\n    answer = matchall(\"^# Answer\\\\n(.*?)(?=\\n)\", md, 1)\n    return (strip.(question), strip.(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function uses two regular expressions to match the questions and answers. The first regex starts at the beginning of the string (`^`) and matches `# Question` followed by any characters until a newline is reached. It then stops matching when it encounters a line that starts with `# Answer`.\n\nThe second regex does the same thing but for the answer, stopping once it reaches a blank line or the end of the string.\n\nThis function returns two tuples; one for each section of the markdown text. The `strip` function is used to remove leading whitespace and newlines from each element in the returned tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,243],"elapsed":1.962235261,"_type":"aimessage"}]
