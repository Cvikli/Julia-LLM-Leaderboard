[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n        elseif in_question && !startswith(line, \" \")\n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif in_answer && !startswith(line, \" \")\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function splits the markdown text into lines and then iterates over each line. If a line starts with \"# Question\", it sets `in_question` to true and continues reading until a non-indented line is found (determined by checking if the first character of the line isn't a space). The same logic applies for the answer section.\n\nThe `strip(line)` function removes leading spaces and newlines from each line before concatenating it to the question or answer string. \n\nPlease note that this is a very basic implementation and might not work perfectly with all types of markdown files, especially if they use different conventions for starting sections (like using `### Question` instead of `# Question`). You would need to adjust the function accordingly in such cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,352],"elapsed":2.812451757,"_type":"aimessage"}]
