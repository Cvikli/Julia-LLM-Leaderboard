[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might define such function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    for line in split(md, '\\n')\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n        end\n        \n        if in_question\n            question *= line[3:end]\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= line[3:end]\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each line of the input markdown string. It uses a boolean flag to determine whether it is currently processing a question or an answer section. If it encounters a line starting with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it flips the corresponding boolean flag and starts accumulating lines until it encounters another section header. For both sections, it strips any leading spaces before concatenating them to their respective strings. The function finally returns the question and answer after finishing reading all the lines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,294],"elapsed":2.347887849,"_type":"aimessage"}]
