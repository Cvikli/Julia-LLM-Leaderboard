[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function `q_and_a_extractor` that would solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n        elseif in_question && !in_answer && isempty(strip(line))\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n        elseif in_question && !isempty(line)\n            question *= strip(line)*\"\\n\"\n        elseif in_answer && !isempty(line)\n            answer *= strip(line)*\"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over the lines of the markdown string. If a line contains \"# Question\", it sets `in_question` to true and continues to add lines to the question until it encounters a blank line. It does the same for lines with \"# Answer\". This approach is based on the assumption that each section is separated by one or more blank lines.\n\nHowever, this solution assumes that the '# Question' and '# Answer' lines are followed by one or more blank lines (i.e., they are separated from the actual questions and answers by empty lines). If there is no such separation in the markdown text, then we will need to use a different approach or make some assumptions about how these sections are formatted.","status":200,"tokens":[0,379],"elapsed":3.183370482,"_type":"aimessage"}]
