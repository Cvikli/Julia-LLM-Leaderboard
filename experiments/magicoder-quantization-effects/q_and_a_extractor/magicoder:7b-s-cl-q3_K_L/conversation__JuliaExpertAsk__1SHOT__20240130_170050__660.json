Here's an example of how you might implement such a function:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    # Find all blocks starting with '# Question' or '# Answer'\n    matches = re.findall(r'\\n(?=#\\s*(Question|Answer))(.+?)(?=\\n\\n)', md, re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE)\n    \n    # Extract text and remove leading spaces and newlines\n    questions_and_answers = [(re.sub(r'^[\\t ]*','', match).strip()) for match in matches]\n    \n    return tuple(questions_and_answers)\n```\nThis function works by finding all blocks of text that start with `# Question` or `# Answer`, and then extracting the text within those blocks. It uses a regular expression to accomplish this, which searches for lines starting with one of these headers followed by any characters (`.+?`), and does so in multi-line mode (`re.MULTILINE`).\n\nThe extracted text is then passed through `re.sub(r'^[\\t ]*','', match).strip()` to remove any leading spaces or newlines, before being returned as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,297],"elapsed":2.382538074,"_type":"aimessage"}]
