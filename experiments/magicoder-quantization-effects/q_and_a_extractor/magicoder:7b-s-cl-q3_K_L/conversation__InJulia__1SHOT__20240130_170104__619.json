[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String) \n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    q_found = false\n    a_found = false\n    \n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            q_found = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\") && q_found\n            a_found = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if q_found \n            question *= line[findfirst('\\n', line)+1:end]\n        elseif a_found\n            answer *= line[findfirst('\\n', line)+1:end]\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function goes through each line of the markdown and checks if it starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If it does, we switch a flag on for that part. Afterwards, we append the current line to the question or answer depending on which section we are currently in (skipping the first character because it's a `#`). We continue until we find an end marker.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that your markdown is formatted correctly and does not handle edge cases such as questions followed by answers, or answers without corresponding questions, etc. It also does not strip trailing white space from the ends of lines. You may want to add error checking based on your needs.","status":200,"tokens":[0,336],"elapsed":2.686918071,"_type":"aimessage"}]
