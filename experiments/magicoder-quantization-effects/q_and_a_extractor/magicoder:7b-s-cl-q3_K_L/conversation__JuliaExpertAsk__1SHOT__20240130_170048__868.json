Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    # split markdown into lines\n    md_lines = md.split(\"\\n\")\n\n    # iterate over lines\n    for line in md_lines:\n        if \"# Question\" in line:\n            # start of a new question, clear the previous answer and set as current question\n            question += \" \"\n        elif \"# Answer\" in line:\n            # end of current question or answer.

If it encounters a line with \"# Question\" at the beginning, it starts collecting lines for the question (after removing leading spaces). Similarly, if it encounters a line with \"# Answer\", it stops collecting lines and moves on to next section. Otherwise, it simply adds each line to either the current question or answer text, after removing leading spaces.\n\nThen it returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer strings, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there's only one \"# Answer\" in the markdown text after every \"# Question\". If the markdown can have multiple \"# Answer\" sections after each \"# Question\", additional logic would be needed to handle that.","status":200,"tokens":[0,370],"elapsed":2.989301029,"_type":"aimessage"}]
