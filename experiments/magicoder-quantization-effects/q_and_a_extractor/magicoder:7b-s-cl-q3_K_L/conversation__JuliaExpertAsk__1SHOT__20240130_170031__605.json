Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function `q_and_a_extractor` that should accomplish this task:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)::Tuple{String, String}\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    inQuestionSection = false\n    inAnswerSection = false\n    \n    for line in lines \n        if startswith(line,\"# Question\")\n            inQuestionSection = true\n            continue\n        elseif inQuestionSection && !startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            question *= strip(replace(line, \"###\" => \"\"))\n        elseif inAnswerSection\n            answer *= strip(replace(line, \"###\" => \"\"))\n        elseif startswith(line,\"# Answer\")\n            inAnswerSection = true\n        end \n    end\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nThis function splits the markdown text into lines and iterates over each line. If it encounters a line that signifies the start of the question section (`# Question`), it starts appending to `question` until it encounters another section header or the end of the file, at which point it stops adding to `question`. \n\nSimilarly for answer section (`# Answer`). After finding `# Question`, it will add all subsequent lines to `question` until it sees another section header. And after finding `# Answer`, it will add all subsequent lines to `answer` until it sees another section header. The `strip()` function is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from the text.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that your markdown file follows a strict structure with every question followed by its answer, each separated by a `# Answer` header. If your markdown file has more complex structures or if you want to extract questions and answers in different ways, additional logic may need to be added.","status":200,"tokens":[0,427],"elapsed":3.44559971,"_type":"aimessage"}]
