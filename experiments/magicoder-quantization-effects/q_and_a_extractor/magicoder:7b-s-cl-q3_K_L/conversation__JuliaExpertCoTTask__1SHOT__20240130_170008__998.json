We do this using regular expressions. Then we strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text using the `strip()` function. If both lists (for question and answer) have exactly one element, then we return these elements as a tuple. Otherwise, an error is raised.","status":200,"tokens":[0,278],"elapsed":2.248517245,"_type":"aimessage"}]
