Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

It then concatenates these sections together. The `strip` function removes any leading spaces and newlines from each section before returning them as a tuple.\n\nYou can use it like this:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat's your favorite programming language?\n\n# Answer\nJulia is my favorite! It has great performance, excellent community support, and is super expressive with the syntax.\n\"\"\"\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md))  # prints (\"What's your favorite programming language?\", \"Julia is my favorite! It has great performance, excellent community support, and is super expressive with the syntax.\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,357],"elapsed":2.877479389,"_type":"aimessage"}]
