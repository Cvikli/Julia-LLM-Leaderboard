Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the function in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"## Answer\") || startswith(line, \"## Question\")\n            state = line[1:end-10]\n        elseif state == \"# Question\" && !isempty(line)\n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif state == \"# Answer\" && !isempty(line)\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by first splitting the input string into an array of lines. It then goes through each line in order. If it encounters a line that starts with \"## Answer\" or \"## Question\", it sets the state variable to the text before those last 10 characters, which are supposed to be \"# Answer\" or \"# Question\".\nIf the state is currently set to \"# Question\", and the current line isn't empty, then it appends the stripped version of that line to the question. Similarly for the answer, if the state is currently set to \"# Answer\", and the current line isn't empty, then it appends the stripped version of that line to the answer.\nFinally, once all lines have been processed, the function returns a tuple containing the question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,329],"elapsed":2.631994296,"_type":"aimessage"}]
