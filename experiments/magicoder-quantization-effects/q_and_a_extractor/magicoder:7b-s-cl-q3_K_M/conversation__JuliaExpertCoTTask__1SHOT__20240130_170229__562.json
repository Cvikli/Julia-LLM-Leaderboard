Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple Python solution to this problem:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = None\n    answer = None\n    \n    for line in md.split('\\n'):\n        if \"# Answer\" in line:\n            answer = re.sub('^ +', '', line.split('# Answer')[1].strip())\n        elif \"# Question\" in line:\n            question = re.sub('^ +', '', line.split('# Question')[1].strip())\n    \n    return (question, answer)\n```\nThe function `q_and_a_extractor` processes each line of the input string to look for '# Question' and '# Answer'. When it sees an '# Answer', it extracts the text following it and stores it as a variable 'answer'. Similarly, when it sees an '# Question', it extracts the text following it and stores it as a variable 'question'. The extracted answers are returned in a tuple. \n\nThis function is quite simple and does not deal with nested questions or answers. If you have such requirements, you will need to adjust this code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,250],"elapsed":1.968177297,"_type":"aimessage"}]
