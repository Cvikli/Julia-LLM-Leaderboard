[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can write `q_and_a_extractor` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestion = false\n    inAnswer = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestion = true\n            continue  # skip this line\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inAnswer = true\n            continue  # skip this line\n        end\n\n        if inQuestion && !isempty(line) && line[1] != ' '\n            question *= strip(line)  # strip leading spaces and newlines\n        elseif inAnswer && !isempty(line) && line[1] != ' '\n            answer *= strip(line)    # strip leading spaces and newlines\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nHere, `startswith` function checks if a string starts with a particular substring. `strip` function removes leading whitespace from the input string. The variable `inQuestion` is true when we are inside a question section and false otherwise. Likewise for `inAnswer`. If both `inQuestion` and `inAnswer` are true, then we append the current line to the question or answer text.\n\nRemember this function does not handle nested sections, nor does it check whether the `# Question` or `# Answer` lines are at the beginning of the file. Depending on your specific requirements, you might need to add additional logic for these cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,366],"elapsed":2.916901597,"_type":"aimessage"}]
