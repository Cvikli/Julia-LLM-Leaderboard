Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia solution for your task:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            continue\n        end\n        if startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        if in_question && !isempty(line)\n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif in_answer && !isempty(line)\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function iterates through each line of the markdown text. When it sees a line that starts with `# Question`, it switches to capturing question text. Similarly, when it sees a line that starts with `# Answer`, it switches to capturing answer text. Any non-empty lines while in these states are appended to `question` and `answer`, respectively. The function returns these two strings as a tuple after finishing reading the markdown.\n\nYou can test this function using the following script:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md)) # Should print (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,364],"elapsed":2.840856254,"_type":"aimessage"}]
