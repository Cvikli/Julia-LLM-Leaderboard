[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is an example of how you might implement this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question = replace(line[14:end], ' ' => \"\")\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer = replace(line[10:end], ' ' => \"\")\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nIn this function, we first split the markdown string `md` into individual lines. Then we iterate over each line and check if it starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If a line does start with one of these strings, we extract the relevant part of the line (excluding the hashes and spaces) and store it in either the question or answer variable. Finally, we return a tuple containing the question and answer.\n\nRemember to strip leading spaces from each line before checking if they are a question or an answer, because the markdown might have indented sections that could confuse this function. \n\nPlease note that this is just a simple implementation, it may not work properly with all types of markdown formatted text as Julia's regular expressions and string manipulation capabilities can be more powerful. For example, it does not handle multiple spaces, tabs or other forms of indentation properly in the markdown.","status":200,"tokens":[0,333],"elapsed":2.608029377,"_type":"aimessage"}]
