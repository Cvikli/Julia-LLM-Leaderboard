Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example solution written in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    for line in split(md, '\\n')\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\") \n            question = replace(line[12:end], \"\\n\" => \" \")\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\") \n            answer = replace(line[10:end], \"\\n\" => \" \")\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function `q_and_a_extractor` works by iterating over each line in the markdown text. When it encounters a line that starts with `# Question`, it saves everything after this into the variable `question`. Similarly, when it encounters a line that starts with `# Answer`, it saves everything after this into the variable `answer`. After going through all lines, it returns these two variables, stripped of leading spaces and newlines.\nYou can test this function using the provided data:\n```julia\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\")) # Expected output: (\"What is the capital of France?\",\"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,312],"elapsed":2.449260113,"_type":"aimessage"}]
