If you want to use this function, first install it via Pkg:\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"Markdown\")\n```\nThis function works by splitting the input markdown string into sections based on the \"###\" separator, which is then iterated over to identify and extract question and answer sections. The extracted text is parsed using `Markdown.parse()` before being returned as a tuple.\n\nTest this function with an example:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n\n# Question\nThis is the question.\n\n### Answer\nThis is the answer to the question.\n\n\"\"\"\nq, a = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: \", strip(q))\nprintln(\"Answer: \", strip(a))\n```\nExpected output:\n```\nQuestion: This is the question.\nAnswer: This is the answer to the question.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,407],"elapsed":3.142703927,"_type":"aimessage"}]
