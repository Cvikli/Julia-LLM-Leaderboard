[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"This problem can be solved using Julia's regex module `Regex` and the built-in string manipulation functions in Julia. Here is a possible solution:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString; instructions = \"\")\n    question_pattern = r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n# Answer\"s\n    answer_pattern = r\"# Answer\\n(.*)\"s\n    if occursin(\"strip_answer\", instructions) \n        answer_pattern = r\"# Answer\\n\\s*(.*)\"s\n    end\n\n    question = match(question_pattern, md).captures[1]\n    answer = match(answer_pattern, md).captures[1]\n\n    # strip leading spaces and newlines\n    question = replace(question, r\"^[ \\t]*\\n\" => \"\")\n    answer = replace(answer, r\"^[ \\t]*\\n\" => \"\")\n\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to match the sections of the markdown text and extracts the text. The `match` function returns a `Match` object which has its own methods for accessing captured groups, such as `.captures`. It is necessary to use the `s` flag at the end of patterns to make them \"sticky\", i.e., they continue matching after a potential end of line. \n\nIn addition, instructions can be provided to remove leading spaces and newlines from the answer section. If the \"strip_answer\" string is found in the instructions, it will strip any leading whitespaces from the answer.","status":200,"tokens":[11,360],"elapsed":2.867609284,"_type":"aimessage"}]
