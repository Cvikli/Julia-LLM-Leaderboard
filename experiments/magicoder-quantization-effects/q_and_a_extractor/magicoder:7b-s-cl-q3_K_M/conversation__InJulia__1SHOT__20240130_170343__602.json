If so, it switches the respective state flag to true, meaning that all subsequent lines till an empty line will be added to question/answer string respectively. If a line is encountered after a start line but before an end-line, it skips leading spaces and adds rest of line to question/answer string. The function returns a tuple (question, answer).","status":200,"tokens":[0,394],"elapsed":3.051617547,"_type":"aimessage"}]
