When it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\", it sets `in_question` to true and continues to append lines starting with non-whitespace characters to `question`. Similarly, when it encounters a line that starts with \"# Answer\", it sets `in_answer` to true and does the same for `answer`. The function returns a tuple of strings representing the question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,278],"elapsed":2.137865901,"_type":"aimessage"}]
