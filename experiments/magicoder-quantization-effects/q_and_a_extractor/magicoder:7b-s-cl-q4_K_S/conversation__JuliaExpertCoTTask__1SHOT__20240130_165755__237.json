Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Python solution using regex to match the sections:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = re.findall(r'\\n\\n# Question(.*?)\\n\\n', md, re.DOTALL)\n    answer = re.findall(r'\\n\\n# Answer(.*?)\\n\\n', md, re.DOTALL)\n    return (question[0].lstrip('\\n '), answer[0].lstrip('\\n '))\n```\nThis function uses regex to find text between `# Question` and `# Answer`. `re.findall` returns all matches as a list of strings. The `r` before the regex string indicates that it is a raw string, which treats backslashes (`\\`) as literal characters, not escape sequences. \n\nThe `re.DOTALL` flag makes `.` (any character) match any character at all, including newline. `lstrip('\\n ')` removes leading newlines and spaces from the matches. If there is no matching text, an empty string is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,245],"elapsed":1.979664241,"_type":"aimessage"}]
