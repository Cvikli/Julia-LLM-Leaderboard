[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use the `each_line` function to iterate over each line of your markdown string. After that, check for the line containing \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", if this is true then you start capturing the lines until a new section (starting with `#`) is detected. At the end you return both the question and the answer stripped from leading whitespaces and newline characters.\n\nHere is the Julia code to do so:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestionSection = false\n    inAnswerSection = false\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestionSection = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inAnswerSection = true\n        elseif inQuestionSection\n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif inAnswerSection\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nYou can test the function with this snippet:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nThis is a question?\n## Answer\nThis is an answer!\n# Another Section\nNot part of the answer.\n\"\"\"\nq_and_a_extractor(md)\n```\n\nPlease note that there may be more sophisticated Markdown parsers available for Julia, which might be beneficial if you need to handle more complex or varied Markdown syntax.","status":200,"tokens":[0,347],"elapsed":2.766468487,"_type":"aimessage"}]
