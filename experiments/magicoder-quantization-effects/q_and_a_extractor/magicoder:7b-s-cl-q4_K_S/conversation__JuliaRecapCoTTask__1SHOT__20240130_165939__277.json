[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you might solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(strip(md), '\\n')  # Split the markdown into lines.\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")  # Start of a new question section.\n            in_question = true  # Switch to collecting the question.\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")  # Start of a new answer section.\n            in_question = false  # Switch to collecting the answer.\n        elseif in_question  # Collecting question text.\n            question *= line[end-2:end] == \"\\n \" ? line[3:end] : line  # Strip leading spaces and newline.\n        else  # Collecting answer text.\n            answer *= line[end-1:end] == \"\\n\" ? line[2:end] : line  # Strip trailing newline.\n        end\n    end\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nThis function splits the markdown into lines and iterates over each one. If it sees a line that starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`, it switches between collecting question text and answer text. It also strips leading spaces and trailing newlines from each section of text.\n\nNote: This is a basic implementation, and might need adjustments depending on the specifics of your task or how the markdown files are formatted. You should consider error handling (for example, what if there's no question or answer in the given markdown?) and additional logic (for example, what if a line in the middle of a question or answer has leading spaces but isn't part of the text?) as needed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,418],"elapsed":3.34118706,"_type":"aimessage"}]
