If it encounters a line with '# Question', it starts recording the question part. Similarly, if it encounters a line with '# Answer', it stops recording the question and starts recording the answer part. It then returns both parts as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,283],"elapsed":2.201734046,"_type":"aimessage"}]
