Then it strips any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text using the `strip` function. This should work assuming that your markdown text strictly follows the format you have described, with each question or answer starting with a `# Question` or `# Answer`.\n\nPlease install required package first by typing in Julia REPL: \n```julia\n] add StringDIPHA\n```","status":200,"tokens":[98,221],"elapsed":1.736194186,"_type":"aimessage"}]
