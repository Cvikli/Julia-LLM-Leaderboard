Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might define such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question = replace(line[12:end], \" \", \"\")\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer = replace(line[10:end], \" \", \"\")\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the input markdown string into lines and checking each line to see if it is a question or an answer section. If a line matches one of these patterns, then the corresponding variable (`question` or `answer`) is set to the rest of that line after removing leading spaces and newlines (via the `replace()` function). The resulting strings are returned as a tuple in the order they were found.","status":200,"tokens":[0,224],"elapsed":1.742946146,"_type":"aimessage"}]
