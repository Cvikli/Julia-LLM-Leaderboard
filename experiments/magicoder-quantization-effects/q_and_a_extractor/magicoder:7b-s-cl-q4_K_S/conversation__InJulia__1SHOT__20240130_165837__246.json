[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example solution using Python's `markdown2` module for converting Markdown to HTML and then parsing the HTML:\n\n```python\nimport markdown2\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    html = markdown2.markdown(md)\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'lxml')\n    \n    question = None\n    answer = None\n    for header in soup.findAll('h1'):\n        if \"Question\" in header.text:\n            question = header.next_sibling.strip()\n        elif \"Answer\" in header.text:\n            answer = header.next_sibling.strip()\n    \n    return (question,answer)\n```\nThis code works by converting the Markdown text to HTML with `markdown2`, then parsing that HTML using Beautiful Soup. It then searches for `<h1>` elements with \"Question\" or \"Answer\" in their text. If a Question header is found, it sets `question` to the next sibling of that header (which should be the question text), and if an Answer header is found, it sets `answer` to the next sibling of that header (which should be the answer text). Finally, it returns a tuple of `(question, answer)`.\n\nPlease note: This solution assumes there is only one \"Question\" section followed by an \"Answer\" section in the Markdown. If there are multiple sections or if they're not ordered this way, the function would need to be modified accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,342],"elapsed":2.650871231,"_type":"aimessage"}]
