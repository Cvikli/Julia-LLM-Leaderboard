Strip any leading spaces.\n        if inQuestion && !startswith(line, \"# Question\") && !startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            question *= replace(line, r\"^[ \\t]*\" => \"\")\n        elseif inAnswer && !startswith(line, \"# Question\") && !startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer *= replace(line, r\"^[ \\t]*\" => \"\")\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nYou can test this function with a markdown string like this:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nThis is the question. \n\nSome more text...\n\n# Answer\nThis is the answer. \n\nMore text...\n\"\"\"\n@show q_and_a_extractor(md)\n```\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there's exactly one `# Question` and one `# Answer` section in your markdown, and that they are correctly ordered (i.e., the answer follows right after the question). If this is not always true, you might need to modify the code a bit.","status":200,"tokens":[0,407],"elapsed":3.152819716,"_type":"aimessage"}]
