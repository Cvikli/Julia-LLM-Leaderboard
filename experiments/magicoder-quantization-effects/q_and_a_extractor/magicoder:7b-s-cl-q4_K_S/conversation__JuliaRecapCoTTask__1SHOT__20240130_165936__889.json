[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is an example of how you might approach this task using the `Markdown` package in Julia. \n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    doc = parse(md, :auto)   # Parsing markdown to DocTree object\n\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    for blk in doc.content\n        if typeof(blk) <: MDHeader && (blk.level == 1 || blk.level == 2)\n            if startswith(lowercase(strip(blk.content)), \"# question\")\n                question = strip(blk.next.content)\n            elseif startswith(lowercase(strip(blk.content)), \"# answer\")\n                answer = strip(blk.next.content)\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first parses the markdown text into a `DocTree`, which is an object in Julia's Markdown package that represents the structure of the document as a tree. Then it iterates over each block of the parsed document. If the block is a header (`MDHeader`) and either the level of the header is 1 (for `# Question`) or 2 (for `## Answer`), then it extracts the content following this header. The content is stripped of leading spaces/newlines using `strip()`.\n\nThe function returns these two pieces of extracted text in a tuple `(question, answer)`. If no question or answer headers are found, or if they have no content (i.e., only whitespace), then an empty string will be returned for that piece of the tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,378],"elapsed":3.028425969,"_type":"aimessage"}]
