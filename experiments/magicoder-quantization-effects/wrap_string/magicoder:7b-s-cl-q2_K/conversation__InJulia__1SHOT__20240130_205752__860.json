It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Below is the code for the function `wrap_string`:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(str::String; text_width::Int = 10)\n    words = split(str, ' ') # Splitting string into words\n    line_len = 0\n    lines = []\n    \n    for word in words\n        if line_len + length(word) > text_width\n            push!(lines, str[1:line_len])\n            str = str[line_len+1] # Remove the part of string that's already been pushed to lines array\n            line_len = 0\n        end\n        \n        line_len += length(word) + 1 # Adding space after word\n    end\n    \n    push!(lines, str) # Pushes remaining part of string into lines\n    \n    return join([line*\"\\n\" for line in lines], \"\")\nend\n```\n\nAn example usage:\n\n```julia\ns = \"Hello World! I love Julia programming.\"\n@assert wrap_string(s) == \"\"\"Hello World!\\nI love Julia programming.\"\"\"\n```\nIn this example, the text `\"Hello World!\"` is already on a new line as per `text_width=10`. The string `\"I love Julia programming.\"` is split into words and added to new lines according to `text_width=10`, i.e., after `\"I\"` there's no more room in the current line so it starts a new line, hence the second part of sentence appears in next line.","status":200,"tokens":[64,350],"elapsed":2.603092776,"_type":"aimessage"}]
