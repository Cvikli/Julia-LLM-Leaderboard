Provide an example","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I can write the function in Julia language like this:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(str::AbstractString, text_width::Int = 10)\n    words = split(str)\n    result = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(result) + length(word) > text_width \n            # If the next addition of a space and word exceeds the text width, append a newline\n            result *= \"\\n\"\n        else \n            # Otherwise, just add the word to the result string with a space in between\n            result *= \" $word\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\nHere is an example of how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed nonne quamquam\"\nprintln(wrap_string(text))\n```\nThis would output a string where each line is no longer than 10 characters. It breaks the string into words and adds new lines at word boundaries so that each line contains at most 10 characters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,258],"elapsed":1.901891121,"_type":"aimessage"}]
