It splits the input string into words, adds each word to a new line once its length plus an additional space reaches or exceeds the specified width limit. Each new line starts with the current_line content (possibly empty), then appends the next word. After adding the final line (which might contain only one word if the text width limit is exactly equal to the word's length), it joins all the lines together separated by a newline and returns the resulting string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,367],"elapsed":2.702742432,"_type":"aimessage"}]
