It checks if adding a new word to the current line would exceed the `text_width`. If it does, it adds a newline and resets the current line length. Then it appends the word to the result string.\n\nWe can test this function with your example:\n\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\n\nAnd you'll get this output:\n\n```julia\n\"This function\nwill wrap \nwords \ninto \nlines\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,271],"elapsed":2.337399566,"_type":"aimessage"}]
