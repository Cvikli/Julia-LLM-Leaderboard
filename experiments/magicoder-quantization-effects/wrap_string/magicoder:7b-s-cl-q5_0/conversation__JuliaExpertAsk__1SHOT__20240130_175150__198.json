It wraps the string into multiple lines if necessary.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(str))\n```\n\nIn this function, `split` is used to split the input string by spaces, and then iterates over each word. For each word, it checks whether adding the current word would exceed the specified text width. If so, a newline character is added; if not (and the result is not empty), a space is added instead. Finally, the current word is appended to the result string. \n\nThe provided example uses your input string and prints out the wrapped version of that string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,260],"elapsed":2.220352692,"_type":"aimessage"}]
