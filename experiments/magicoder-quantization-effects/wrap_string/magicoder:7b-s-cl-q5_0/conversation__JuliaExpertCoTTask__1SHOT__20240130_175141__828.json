Then we iterate over each word and add it to our result string, checking at the same time if adding the current word would exceed our line width. If so, a newline character is added and the `current_line_length` reset. The word is then added with or without a leading space depending on whether this is the first word in the line.","status":200,"tokens":[0,365],"elapsed":3.176609435,"_type":"aimessage"}]
