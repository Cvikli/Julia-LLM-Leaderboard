This function should handle this scenario perfectly.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(s))\n```\n\nThis `wrap_string` function works by first splitting the input string into individual words. It then iterates over each word, adding them one at a time to a new line (`line`). If the combined length of `line` and the current word exceeds `text_width`, it pushes `line` onto the `lines` array (which will hold all lines), clears `line`, and starts again. If `line` is empty, it just adds the current word to `line`.\n\nAt the end of the loop, it needs to add whatever's left in `line` to the `lines` array, since it didn't get added when length was exceeded. So it pushes `line` onto the `lines` array again (which will hold all lines). \n\nFinally, it joins all of the individual lines with newline characters (`\"\\n\"`) and returns that string.\n\nIn this example usage, if you run `wrap_string(s)`, it should print out each line of the input string on a new line, wrapping them so that no one line exceeds 10 characters in length (the default `text_width`).","status":200,"tokens":[0,455],"elapsed":3.896421623,"_type":"aimessage"}]
