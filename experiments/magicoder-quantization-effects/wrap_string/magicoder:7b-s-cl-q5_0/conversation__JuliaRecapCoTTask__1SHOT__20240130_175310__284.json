[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

Here is a possible implementation of such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString; text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text, ' ')\n    lines = String[]\n    line_parts = String[]\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(word) > text_width\n            error(\"Word \\\"$word\\\" exceeds the maximum allowed width $text_width\")\n        end\n        \n        if length(join(line_parts, ' ')) + length(word) > text_width\n            push!(lines, join(line_parts, '\\n'))\n            empty!(line_parts)\n        end\n        \n        push!(line_parts, word)\n    end\n    \n    if !isempty(line_parts)\n        push!(lines, join(line_parts, '\\n'))\n    end\n    \n    return join(lines, '\\n')\nend\n```\n\nThis function splits the input string into individual words. Then for each word it checks whether adding this word to the current line would exceed the maximum width (default 10). If that's the case, a new line is started and the old line is added to the result array. At the end of all lines are combined with newline characters and returned.\n\nHere is an example usage:\n```julia\ntext = \"This is some test text for wrapping.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(text; text_width=10))  # Outputs: This is \\nsome test\\ntext for \\nwrapping.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[11,377],"elapsed":3.318407064,"_type":"aimessage"}]
