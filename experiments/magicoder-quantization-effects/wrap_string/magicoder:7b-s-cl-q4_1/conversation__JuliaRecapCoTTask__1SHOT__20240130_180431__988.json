[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

If no `text_width` is provided, it defaults to 10. The function splits the input string into words using the `split` function, then iterates over these words. For each word, if adding this word to the current line would exceed `text_width`, the function appends the current line to the list of lines and starts a new line with just this word; otherwise, it adds this word to the current line. Finally, after the loop, if there are any remaining words in the current line (which could happen if the last line was too short), it appends this line to the list of lines. The function returns these lines joined by a newline character. \n\nHere is an example:\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This is a test. This is only a test.\", 12))\n```\nOutput:\n```\n\"This is a test.\"\n\"This is only a test.\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,362],"elapsed":2.977722316,"_type":"aimessage"}]
