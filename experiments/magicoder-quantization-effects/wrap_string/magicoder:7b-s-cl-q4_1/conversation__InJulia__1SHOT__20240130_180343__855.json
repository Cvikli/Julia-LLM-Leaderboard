It appends each word to a \"line\" string until this line's length exceeds the specified `text_width`. At that point, it starts a new line in the result string with the current line. This process is repeated for all words in the input string. Finally, any remaining words are added to the end of the result string after starting a new line.","status":200,"tokens":[0,248],"elapsed":1.989439346,"_type":"aimessage"}]
