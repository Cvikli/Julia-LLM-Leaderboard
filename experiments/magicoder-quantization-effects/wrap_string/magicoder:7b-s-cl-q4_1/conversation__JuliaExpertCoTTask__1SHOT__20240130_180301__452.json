It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's how you can write that function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String; text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text, ' ')\n    lines = Vector{String}()\n    current_line = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line * \" $word\") > text_width\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = \"$word\"\n        else\n            current_line *= \" $word\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    push!(lines, current_line)\n    return join(lines, '\\n')\nend\n```\nThis function splits the input text into words and iterates over each word. It checks if adding a new word to the line would exceed the `text_width`. If it would, it appends the line to lines (which stores all complete lines), resets current_line, and adds the next word to the new line. If adding the word won't exceed the width, it just adds the word to the current_line. At the end of the loop, it pushes the last remaining line to lines and joins them together with newline characters. \n\nAnd here is how you can run this function:\n\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\n\nThe output should be:\n\n```julia\n\"This function will\nwrap words\ninto lines\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,333],"elapsed":2.67988758,"_type":"aimessage"}]
