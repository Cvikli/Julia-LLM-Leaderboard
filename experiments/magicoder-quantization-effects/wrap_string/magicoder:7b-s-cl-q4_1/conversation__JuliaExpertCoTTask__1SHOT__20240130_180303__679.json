If adding the next word would cause it to exceed the limit, a new line is started and the old line's content is added to the result.\n\nFor your data example \"wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")\", it should return:\n\n```julia\n\"This function\\nwill wrap words\\ninto lines\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,263],"elapsed":2.117394632,"_type":"aimessage"}]
