Then we create a new variable `wrapped_text` which is initially empty. For each word in our list of words, we check if adding the current word to `wrapped_text` would exceed the maximum width allowed (`text_width`). If it would exceed this width, we add a newline character (`\\n`) to `wrapped_text`. Then we append the word to `wrapped_text`, followed by a space.\nFinally, we return `wrapped_text` which now contains the text string wrapped according to our specified rules. We also provide an example of how to use this function with the provided data.","status":200,"tokens":[0,287],"elapsed":2.309758567,"_type":"aimessage"}]
