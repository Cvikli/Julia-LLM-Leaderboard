It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is how you can do that in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(str::String; text_width::Int = 10)\n    words = split(str, ' ')\n    result = \"\"\n    for word in words\n        if length(word)*2 > text_width || (length(result)*2 + length(word)) > text_width\n            result *= \"\\n\"\n        end\n        result *= \"$word \"\n    end\n    return result\nend\n\n# example usage:\nstr = \"This is a test string. This string should be broken up into multiple lines.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(str))\n```\nThis function works by splitting the input string into words and then iterating over each word. If adding the current word to `result` would exceed the maximum width (or if it's the first word), it adds a newline character before adding the word. The function then returns `result`, which contains the wrapped text.\n\nIn this example, the string is not very long and does not require wrapping; however, if you test with a longer string, it should break into multiple lines as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[0,256],"elapsed":2.039035351,"_type":"aimessage"}]
