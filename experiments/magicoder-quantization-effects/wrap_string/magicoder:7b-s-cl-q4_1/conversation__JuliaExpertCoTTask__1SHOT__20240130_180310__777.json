If this number exceeds `text_width`, then it starts a new line, otherwise, it continues adding words to the current line.\n\nSo if you call `wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")`, you'll get: \n\n```julia\n\"This\\nfunction\\nwill\\nwrap\\nwords\\ninto\\nlines\\n\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,213],"elapsed":1.710211223,"_type":"aimessage"}]
