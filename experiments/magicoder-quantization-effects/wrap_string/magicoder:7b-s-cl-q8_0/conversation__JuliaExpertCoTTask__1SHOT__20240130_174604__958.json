[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia code for your problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::String; text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(s, ' ')\n    result = \"\"\n    current_line = \"\"\n    max_len = 0\n\n    for word in words\n        if length(word) + length(current_line) > text_width || length(result) == 0\n            if !isempty(current_line)\n                append!(result, \"\\n\")\n                append!(result, current_line)\n            end\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            if !isempty(current_line)\n                append!(current_line, \" \")\n            end\n            append!(current_line, word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return result * \"\\n\" * current_line  # add the last line to results\nend\n```\n\nYou can use this function by calling: `wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")` or you can customize the `text_width` by specifying it when calling the function. For example: `wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"; text_width = 15)`. The provided code wraps each word in a string, breaking at the specified width (or 10 if not specified) and adding new lines for every new word.\n\nPlease note that this approach assumes you want to keep the initial word of each line followed by its own words. If you want to start each new line with the whole previous sentence plus the current word, instead of just the current word, a different approach might be more appropriate.","status":200,"tokens":[0,363],"elapsed":4.108179892,"_type":"aimessage"}]
