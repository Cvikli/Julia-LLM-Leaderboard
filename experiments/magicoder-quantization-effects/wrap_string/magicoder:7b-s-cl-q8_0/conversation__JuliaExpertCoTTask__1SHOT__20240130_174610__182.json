If so, we add the current line to our list of lines, and start a new line.\n- We then add this word to the end of our current line.\n- After we've gone through all the words, we add the final line to our list of lines.\n- Finally, we return a string where each newline character is followed by a line from our array of lines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,297],"elapsed":3.346852856,"_type":"aimessage"}]
