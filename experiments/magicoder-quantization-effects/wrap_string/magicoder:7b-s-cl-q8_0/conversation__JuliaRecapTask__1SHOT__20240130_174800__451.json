[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

For each word, it checks whether adding the current word to the existing line (which is initially an empty string) would cause the line length to exceed `text_width`. If so, it appends the current line to the result and starts a new line with only this word. Otherwise, it simply adds the current word to the end of the current line. At the end of the iteration over words, it adds the last line to the result.\n\nAn example usage:\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"Hello World, I am Julia\"))  # Outputs \"Hello\\nWorld, I\\nam Julia\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,298],"elapsed":3.438701632,"_type":"aimessage"}]
