Before adding a new word, it checks whether adding that word would exceed the specified `text_width`. If so, it adds a newline character and resets `line_len`. Otherwise, it just adds a space character. The line length is updated accordingly. \n\nThis function provides an example when called as follows:\n```julia\nprint(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\nIt should output:\n```\nThis function\nwill wrap\nwords into\nlines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,283],"elapsed":3.194208198,"_type":"aimessage"}]
