Then it iterates over these words, checking at each step whether adding the current word would cause the line length to exceed `text_width`. If so, it appends a newline character before adding the word. Finally, it returns the resulting string.\n\nWhen you run this code with the provided example text, it will output:\n```julia\nThis function \nwill wrap \nwords into \nlines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,235],"elapsed":1.886339182,"_type":"aimessage"}]
