It then splits the input string into words using Julia's built-in `split` function.\n\nFor each word in the list of words, it checks whether adding the current word to the existing line would exceed the maximum width or not. If it wouldnâ€™t, the word is appended to the line with a space in between (to preserve the original word order). \n\nIf it would exceed the width, the function prints out the current line and starts a new one with just this word. At the end of processing all words, if there's anything left in `line`, it's printed out.","status":200,"tokens":[0,299],"elapsed":2.421418957,"_type":"aimessage"}]
