Then for each word in the array, if adding a new word to current line would result in exceeding text width then add newline and start a new line with current word otherwise just add the word to the current line.\n\nThe final result is returned by concatenating remaining lines in the end. If no newline is needed at all, the last line will be printed without any trailing newline.","status":200,"tokens":[0,242],"elapsed":1.959311657,"_type":"aimessage"}]
