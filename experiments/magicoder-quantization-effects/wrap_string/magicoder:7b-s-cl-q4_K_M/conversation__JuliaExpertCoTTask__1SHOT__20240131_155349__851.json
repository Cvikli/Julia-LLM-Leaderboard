For each word, it checks whether adding this word to the current line would exceed the maximum `text_width`. If not, it adds the word to the current line. If yes, it appends the current line to the result and starts a new line with this word. After going through all words, it appends the last line to the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,217],"elapsed":1.737025356,"_type":"aimessage"}]
