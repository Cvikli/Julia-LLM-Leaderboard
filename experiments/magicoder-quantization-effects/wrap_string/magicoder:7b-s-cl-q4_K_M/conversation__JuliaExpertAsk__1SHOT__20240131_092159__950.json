If adding the current word to the result would exceed `text_width`, it adds a newline before adding the word. It then appends the word and a space to the result. The resulting string is returned after all words have been processed.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This is a test of wrapping text.\", 10))\n```\nThe output will be:\n```\nThis is a \ntest of \nwrapping \ntext.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[94,236],"elapsed":1.923552421,"_type":"aimessage"}]
