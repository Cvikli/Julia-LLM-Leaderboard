The function splits the input string into words, then iterates through each word. If adding a new word would exceed the maximum line length, it starts a new line; otherwise, it adds the word to the current line. Finally, after going through all the words, it appends the remaining line of text (if any) at the end of the result string.\n\nLet's test this function using your provided example:\n\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\n\nThe output should be:\n\n```text\nThis function\nwill wrap\nwords into\nlines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,289],"elapsed":2.320235056,"_type":"aimessage"}]
