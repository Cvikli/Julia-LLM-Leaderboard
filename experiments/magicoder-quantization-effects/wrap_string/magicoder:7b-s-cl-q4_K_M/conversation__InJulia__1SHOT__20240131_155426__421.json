It then splits the input string into individual words using the `split` function. The resulting list of words is iterated over, checking at each step whether adding the current word would exceed the maximum allowed length for a line (i.e., `text_width`). If it does, a newline character (\"\\n\") is added to start a new line, and the length counter is reset to 0. If adding the next word would not exceed the limit, a space is added between it and the current words in the result string, and the length counter incremented by one. Finally, the resulting string with lines wrapped as per the `text_width` parameter is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[64,345],"elapsed":2.774511794,"_type":"aimessage"}]
