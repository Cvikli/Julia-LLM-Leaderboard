[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Special instructions: \n\nFor example, you want to limit the width of the text in each line to 10 characters. If a word alone exceeds this limit, it will move to the next line. Otherwise, it will continue adding words until reaching this limit and then start a new line. The function should be able to handle any string input.\n\n# Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef wrap_string(input_str: str, text_width=10):\n    words = input_str.split()\n    result = []\n    \n    for word in words:\n        if len(' '.join(result[-1:])) + len(word) > text_width:\n            result.append([])\n            \n        result[-1].append(word)\n        \n    return '\\n'.join([' '.join(words) for words in result])\n\nprint(wrap_string(\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.\"))\n```\nThis code defines the function `wrap_string` which takes an input string and a maximum width of the text per line. It splits the input string into words and then iterates over these words. If adding a new word would cause the width of the current line to exceed the limit, it starts a new line. The resulting lines are then joined together with newline characters in between.\n\n# Julia Solution\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(input_str::String, text_width=10)\n    words = split(input_str)\n    result = String[]\n    \n    line_length = 0\n    for word in words\n        if line_length + length(word) > text_width\n            push!(result, \"\")\n            line_length = 0\n        end\n        \n        line_length += length(word)\n        push!(result[end], word)\n    end\n    \n    return join([join(words) for words in result], '\\n')\nend\n\nprint(wrap_string(\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.\"))\n```\nThis code does the same thing as the Python version. It splits the input string into a list of words and then iterates over these words. Whenever adding a word would exceed the limit per line, it starts a new line. The resulting lines are joined together with newline characters in between. Note that strings in Julia must be quoted whereas numbers can be written as is.","status":200,"tokens":[11,544],"elapsed":4.514653778,"_type":"aimessage"}]
