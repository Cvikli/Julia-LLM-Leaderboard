[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

This function will wrap it for you.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(example_string))\n```\n\nHere, `strwidth` is a built-in Julia function which returns the number of characters in a string, not considering any special characters or unicode sequences. Therefore, it can give an accurate width estimate. The `split` function separates the input string into words, and the for loop then goes through each word, checking if adding that word to the current line would exceed `text_width`. If so, it adds the current line to the list of lines and starts a new one with just that word. It keeps on doing this until all words have been processed, at which point it adds the final line to the list of lines. Finally, `join` is used to combine each line in the array into a single string separated by newline characters (`\"\\n\"`).\n\nThis function will wrap the input string such that no line exceeds the specified width, and return this wrapped string as output.","status":200,"tokens":[0,369],"elapsed":3.038025612,"_type":"aimessage"}]
