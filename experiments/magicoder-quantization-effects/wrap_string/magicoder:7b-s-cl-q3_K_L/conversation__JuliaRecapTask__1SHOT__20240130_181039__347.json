[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded.

It splits the input text into words, then iterates over these words. If adding the current word would cause the line to exceed `text_width`, it adds a newline character to the result and starts a new line. After each word (or after the first one), it appends the word followed by a space. At the end of all iterations, it returns the resulting string with lines wrapped according to the specified width.\n\nHere is an example of how you can call this function:\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"Hello world! This is Julia programming language.\", text_width=20))\n```\nThis will print:\n```\nHello world! \nThis is Julia programming \nlanguage.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,344],"elapsed":2.825964625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
