It checks if adding a word to the current line would exceed the maximum text width, if not it adds the word to the line, else it prints out the line, starts a new line with this word, and continues. At the end of the iteration, there might be an unprinted line so we print it as well. \n\nAn example of how you could call `wrap_string` function is:\n```julia\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,243],"elapsed":1.952987037,"_type":"aimessage"}]
