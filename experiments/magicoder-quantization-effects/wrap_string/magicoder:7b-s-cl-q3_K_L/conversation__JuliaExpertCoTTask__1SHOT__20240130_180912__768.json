For each word, it checks if adding this word to the current line would exceed the maximum width `text_width`. If not, it adds the word to the current line; otherwise, it starts a new line with this word and adds all current line words to the result array. After the loop, it adds any remaining words in the last line to the result array. Finally, it joins the elements of the result array into a single string with newline characters between each line and returns it.\n\nWhen we call `wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")`, it would return:\n\n```\n\"This \nfunction \nwill \nwrap \nwords \ninto \nlines\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,382],"elapsed":3.077750617,"_type":"aimessage"}]
