Then we initialize two strings, `result` and `line`, which are used to store the final output and current line respectively. \n\nFor each word, we check if adding it to the current line would exceed the maximum text width. If so, we add the current line to the result and reset the line string. Then we append the current word to the line. At the end of the loop, we add the remaining line to the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,261],"elapsed":2.114222419,"_type":"aimessage"}]
