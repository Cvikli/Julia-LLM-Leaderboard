If it does, it adds a newline character before the current line and starts a new line with the current word. It repeats this process until all words have been processed. The final line is added after the loop completes.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\", 10))\n```\n\nThis would output:\n\n```\nThis function\nwill wrap\nwords into\nlines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,258],"elapsed":4.573642611,"_type":"aimessage"}]
