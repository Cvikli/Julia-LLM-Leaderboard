The function splits the input string into words, then iteratively adds each word to a line. If adding the next word would exceed the specified width, it starts a new line. Finally, it returns the resulting string with lines separated by newline characters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,258],"elapsed":4.477106752,"_type":"aimessage"}]
