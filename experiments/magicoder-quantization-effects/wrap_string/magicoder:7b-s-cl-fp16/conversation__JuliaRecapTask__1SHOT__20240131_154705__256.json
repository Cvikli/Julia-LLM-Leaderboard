[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

It's just a simple test.\"))\n```\n\nIn this solution, we split the input string into words and then iterate over them. For each word, we check if adding it to the current line would exceed the `text_width`. If it would, we add the current line to our result (with a newline character at the start if it's not the first line), then start a new line with just that word. Otherwise, we just add the word to the end of the current line. At the end, we add whatever is left over in the current line to the result and return it.\n\nThe test string \"This is a test. It's just a simple test.\" will be printed as:\n```\nThis is a \ntest. It's \njust a \nsimple test.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,343],"elapsed":5.999929522,"_type":"aimessage"}]
