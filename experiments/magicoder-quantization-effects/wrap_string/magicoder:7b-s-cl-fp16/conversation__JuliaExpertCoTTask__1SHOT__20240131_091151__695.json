Then a loop iterates over each word in the list of words. If adding the current word to the current line would exceed the maximum width, a new line is started and the current word is added to that new line. Otherwise, the word is added to the current line. After all words have been processed, any remaining text on the current line (which doesn't exceed the maximum width) is added to the result followed by a newline character.","status":200,"tokens":[0,261],"elapsed":4.59554606,"_type":"aimessage"}]
