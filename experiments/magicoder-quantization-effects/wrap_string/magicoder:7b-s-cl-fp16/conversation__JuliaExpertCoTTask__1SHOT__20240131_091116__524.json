For each word, it checks if adding this word to the current line would exceed the `text_width`. If so, it appends the current line to the result (with a newline at the end) and starts a new line. Then it adds the word to the current line. After all words have been processed, it appends the remaining line to the result.\n\nHere is an example of usage:\n\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\n\nThe output would be:\n\n```\nThis function \nwill wrap words \ninto lines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,273],"elapsed":4.801115964,"_type":"aimessage"}]
