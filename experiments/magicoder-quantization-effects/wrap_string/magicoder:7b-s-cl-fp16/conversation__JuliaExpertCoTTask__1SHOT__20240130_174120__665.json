If the length of the current line plus the length of the current word would exceed the maximum width and it's not the first word, a newline character is added to the output. Then, the length of the current line is reset to 0.\n- After processing all words, if the line hasn't been started yet, an empty string is added before starting each new line. The processed word (including a leading space) and a newline are then appended to the current line.","status":200,"tokens":[218,313],"elapsed":49.882973465,"_type":"aimessage"}]
