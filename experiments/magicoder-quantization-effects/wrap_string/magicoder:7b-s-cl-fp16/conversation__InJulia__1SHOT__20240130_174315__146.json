The words are separated by spaces and it will wrap after the maximum width.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(s))\n```\n\nThis will return a string where each line does not exceed `text_width`. In this case, `text_width` is set to 10 so it wraps after every 10 characters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,264],"elapsed":4.598393475,"_type":"aimessage"}]
