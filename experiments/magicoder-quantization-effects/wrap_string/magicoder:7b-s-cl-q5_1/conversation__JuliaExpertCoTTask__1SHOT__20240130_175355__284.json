For every word, it checks if adding that word to the current line would exceed the `text_width`. If so, it starts a new line. After processing all the words, it returns the final result which is the entire string with lines separated by newline characters.\n\nExample:\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\", 10))\n```\nThe output should be:\n```bash\n\"This\\nfunction\\nwill\\nwrap\\nwords\\ninto\\nlines\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,345],"elapsed":3.11732513,"_type":"aimessage"}]
