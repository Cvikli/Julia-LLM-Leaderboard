[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded.

If adding a word to the current line would exceed the maximum allowed width, we add the current line to our lines array and start a new one. We then append the next word to the current line with a space and move on to the next word in the input.\n\nAfter the loop, we might not have added the last line if there are no more words left, so we check that `current_line` is not empty before adding it to the list of lines. \n\nFinally, we join all the lines together with a newline character in between each one and return this result.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Hello\", \"world!\", \"How\", \"are\", \"you?\"]\nprint(wrap_string(words))  # prints:\n# Hello world!\n# How are you?\n```\nThe text is wrapped after a maximum of 10 characters per line by default, but you can specify your own value in the `text_width` argument.","status":200,"tokens":[0,429],"elapsed":3.955411746,"_type":"aimessage"}]
