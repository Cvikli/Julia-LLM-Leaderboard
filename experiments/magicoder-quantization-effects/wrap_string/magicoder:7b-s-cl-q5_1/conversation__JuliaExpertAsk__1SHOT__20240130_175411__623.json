Integer nec odio. Morbi non quam nec dui luctus rutrum.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(str)) \n```\n\nThis code defines a function `wrap_string` that takes a string and an optional text width argument. It then splits the input string into individual words and checks if adding each word to the current line would exceed the maximum allowed length (`text_width`). If it does, it appends the current line to the result string (with a newline character in front) and starts a new line with only that word. If it doesn't, it simply adds the word to the current line. Finally, after iterating over all words, it appends any remaining words on the last line if they exist.","status":200,"tokens":[0,323],"elapsed":2.885555067,"_type":"aimessage"}]
