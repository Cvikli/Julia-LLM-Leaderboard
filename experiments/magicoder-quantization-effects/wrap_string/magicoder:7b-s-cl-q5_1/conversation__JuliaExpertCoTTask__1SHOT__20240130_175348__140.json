Then it loops through each word and checks if adding the current word to the line will exceed the maximum width. If so, it appends a new line to the result string containing the previous line, and starts a new line with the current word. Otherwise, it just adds the current word to the end of the line. After the loop, it adds any remaining line to the result and returns it.\n\nHere is an example of calling this function:\n\n```julia\nprint(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\nThe expected output is:\n\n```\nThis function \nwill wrap \nwords into \nlines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,281],"elapsed":2.534219026,"_type":"aimessage"}]
