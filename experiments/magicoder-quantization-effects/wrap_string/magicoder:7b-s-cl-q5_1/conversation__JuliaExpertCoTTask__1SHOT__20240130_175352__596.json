We define the function `wrap_string` that takes a string and an optional parameter `text_width`. If no argument is provided for `text_width`, it defaults to 10.\n2. Inside the function, we split the input string into words using Julia's built-in `split` function. We also initialize an array of strings `lines` that will store each line of text.\n3. Then we iterate over each word in the list of words. For each word, we first check if adding it to the current line would exceed the maximum allowed width by using Julia's built-in `length` function. If this is the case, we append the current line to our lines array and reset the line for the next iteration.\n4. Finally, after we have gone through all the words, we append the last line to our lines array. \n5. We then join all of the strings in our `lines` array with newline characters between each item using Julia's built-in `join` function and return this resulting string.\n6. The example call to `wrap_string` is simply a test case where we apply the function to some text that should be wrapped onto new lines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,402],"elapsed":3.660079392,"_type":"aimessage"}]
