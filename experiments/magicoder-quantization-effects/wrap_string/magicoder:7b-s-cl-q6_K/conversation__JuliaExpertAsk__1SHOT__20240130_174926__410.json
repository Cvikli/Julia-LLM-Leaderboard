It checks if adding `word` to `current_line` would exceed the `text_width`, at which point it adds `current_line` to `lines` (which holds all of the lines of text so far) and starts a new `current_line` with just `word`.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nprint(wrap_string(\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\", 10))\n```\nThis will output:\n\n```\nThe quick\nbrown fox\njumps over\nthe lazy\ndog\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,333],"elapsed":3.211140048,"_type":"aimessage"}]
