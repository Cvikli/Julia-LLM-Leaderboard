For each word, it checks if concatenating that word to the current line would exceed the maximum width. If so, it prints the current line and starts a new one. Finally, after going through all the words, it prints the last line as well.","status":200,"tokens":[0,257],"elapsed":2.505126529,"_type":"aimessage"}]
