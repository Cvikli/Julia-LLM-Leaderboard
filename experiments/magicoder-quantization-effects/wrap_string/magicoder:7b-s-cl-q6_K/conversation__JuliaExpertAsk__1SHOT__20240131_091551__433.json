Whenever adding a new word would cause the current line's length to exceed `text_width`, it appends the current line to the result (adding a newline if necessary) and starts a new line. At the end, it appends the remaining line to the result.\n\nHere is an example usage:\n\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This is a test string for wrapping\", 10))\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```plaintext\nThis is a \ntest string \nfor wrapping\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,259],"elapsed":2.509434382,"_type":"aimessage"}]
