Then a loop iterates over each word in the array. If adding the length of the current word would exceed the maximum allowed line width (`text_width`), a newline character is added to the result string and the line length is reset to zero. Otherwise, if the result string is not empty, a space is added between the words. The word itself is then appended to the result string and its length added to the line length.\n\nWhen you run this code with the example text \"This function will wrap words into lines\", it would output:\n\n```julia\nThis \nfunction \nwill \nwrap \nwords \ninto \nlines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,324],"elapsed":3.111599619,"_type":"aimessage"}]
