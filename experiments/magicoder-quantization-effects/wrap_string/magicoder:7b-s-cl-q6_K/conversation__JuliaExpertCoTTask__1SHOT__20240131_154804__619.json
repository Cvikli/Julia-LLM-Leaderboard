The word itself is then appended to the result string. If no width limit is provided, a default value of 10 characters per line is used.\n\nLet's test our function with your example:\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\nThe expected output should be:\n```\nThis function \nwill wrap \nwords into \nlines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,254],"elapsed":2.43351984,"_type":"aimessage"}]
