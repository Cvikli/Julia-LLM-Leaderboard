It splits the input string into words, then iterates over each word. If adding the current word to the current line would exceed `text_width`, it adds that line to the result and starts a new line with just that word. At the end of the loop, it adds whatever is left in the current line to the result.\n\nAn example usage:\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This is a test string to demonstrate wrapping.\", 12))\n```\nThis will output:\n```\nThis is a test\nstring to \ndemonstrate wrapping.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,273],"elapsed":2.602198637,"_type":"aimessage"}]
