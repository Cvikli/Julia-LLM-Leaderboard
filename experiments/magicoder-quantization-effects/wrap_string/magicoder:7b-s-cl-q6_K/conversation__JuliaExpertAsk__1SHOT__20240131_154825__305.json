Then for each word, it checks if adding this word to the current line would exceed the maximum width. If it would, a newline character is added and the length of the line is reset. Otherwise, a space is added and the length of the line is updated. The word is then appended to the string.","status":200,"tokens":[94,283],"elapsed":2.72427449,"_type":"aimessage"}]
