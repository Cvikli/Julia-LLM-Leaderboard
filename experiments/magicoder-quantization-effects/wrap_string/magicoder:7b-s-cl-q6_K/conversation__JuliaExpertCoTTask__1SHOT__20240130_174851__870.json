[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is your solution written in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(s, \" \")\n    lines = String[]\n\n    current_line = \"\"\n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line * \" $word\") > text_width\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = \"$word\"\n        else\n            current_line *= \" $word\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Add the last line (if there are any words left after the loop)\n    if !isempty(current_line)\n        push!(lines, current_line)\n    end\n    \n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function splits the input string into words and iterates over each word. If adding a new word to the current line would exceed the `text_width`, it pushes the current line to the result (a list of lines) and starts a new line with only this word. At the end, if there is any word left in `current_line` (after the loop), it gets pushed into the list as well. The function then joins the list of lines with newline characters and returns it.\n\nNow let's test our function with your example:\n\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\n\nThe output should be:\n\n```\nThis function\nwill wrap\nwords into\nlines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[218,344],"elapsed":12.442990106,"_type":"aimessage"}]
