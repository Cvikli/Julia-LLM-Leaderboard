For each word, it checks whether adding this word to the current line would exceed the maximum allowed length (`text_width`). If not, it adds the word to the line; otherwise, it starts a new line with this word. At the end of the loop, if there is still some text left in `line`, it adds this remaining text to `output` followed by an extra newline character to make sure that each wrapped line ends with a newline character.\n\nExample:\n\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This is a very long string that needs to be wrapped\"))\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```plaintext\nThis is a \nvery long \nstring that \nneeds to be \nwrapped\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,341],"elapsed":3.28416839,"_type":"aimessage"}]
