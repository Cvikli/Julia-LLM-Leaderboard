It splits the input string into words, then checks for each word whether adding it to the current line would exceed the specified width. If so, it appends the current line to the result and starts a new one. Finally, it appends the remaining line to the result and returns the complete output string.\n\nThe provided example:\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\nWill print:\n```\nThis function \nwill wrap \nwords into \nlines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[218,251],"elapsed":8.281958566,"_type":"aimessage"}]
