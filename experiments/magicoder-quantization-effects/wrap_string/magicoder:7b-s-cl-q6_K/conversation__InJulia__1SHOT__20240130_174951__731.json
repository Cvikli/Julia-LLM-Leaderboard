Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the code in Julia to solve the problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::String; text_width::Int = 10)\n    words = split(s, \" \")\n    lines = String[]\n    \n    curr_line = \"\"\n    for word in words\n        if length(curr_line * \" $word\") > text_width\n            push!(lines, curr_line)\n            curr_line = \"$word\"\n        else\n            curr_line *= \" $word\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    push!(lines, curr_line)  # push the last line\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")  # join with newline character\nend\n```\nIn this code, we first split the input string into words. Then for each word, we check if adding it to the current line would exceed `text_width`. If so, we add the current line to the list of lines and start a new line with just the current word. Otherwise, we continue to build up the current line by appending the current word to it with a space in between. Finally, after going through all words, we add the remaining line to our list of lines. We then join these lines into a single string where each line is separated by a newline character (`\\n`). \n\nHere's an example:\n\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\", text_width=12))\n```\nOutput:\n```\nThe quick\nbrown fox\njumps over\nthe lazy dog\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,353],"elapsed":3.400982189,"_type":"aimessage"}]
