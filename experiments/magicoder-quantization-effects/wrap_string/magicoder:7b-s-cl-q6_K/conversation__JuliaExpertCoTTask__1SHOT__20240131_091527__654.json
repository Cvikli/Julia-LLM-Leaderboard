For each word, it checks whether adding this word to the current line would exceed the maximum width. If so, it starts a new line. It then adds the word to the current line. After going through all the words, it appends the remaining content of the line (if any) to the result.\n\nHere is an example usage:\n\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\n\nThis would print:\n\n```\nThis function \nwill wrap \nwords into \nlines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[218,253],"elapsed":28.211635244,"_type":"aimessage"}]
