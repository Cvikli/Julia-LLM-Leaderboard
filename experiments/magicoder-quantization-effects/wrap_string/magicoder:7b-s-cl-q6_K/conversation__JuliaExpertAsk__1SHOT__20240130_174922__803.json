Integer id commodo eros, nec pretium enim.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(text))\n```\n\nThis function takes a string `text` and an optional parameter `text_width`, which defaults to 10 if not specified. It splits the input text into words using whitespace as the separator, then iterates over these words. For each word, it checks whether adding this word to the current line would exceed the specified width. If so, it adds the current line to a list of lines (which will later be joined with newline characters), and starts a new current line. After processing all words, it adds any remaining words in the current line to the list of lines, and finally joins this list of lines with newline characters before returning it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,334],"elapsed":3.234857454,"_type":"aimessage"}]
