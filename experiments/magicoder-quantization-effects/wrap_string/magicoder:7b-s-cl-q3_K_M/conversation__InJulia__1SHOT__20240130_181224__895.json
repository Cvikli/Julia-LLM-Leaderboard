It splits the text into words, then iterates over each word. For every new word, it checks whether adding this word to the current line would result in a line longer than the allowed width. If not, it adds the word to the current line and continues with the next word. If adding the word to the current line would exceed the width, it adds the current line to the list of lines and starts a new line with only this word. Finally, if there's any remaining text in the current line (i.e., after all words have been processed), it adds that final line to the list of lines. The function then returns a string consisting of all lines joined by newline characters (`'\\n'`).\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\ntext = \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed ac diam nec purus mollis dictum in at sem.\"\nprint(wrap_string(text))\n```\nThis will print:\n```\nLorem ipsum\ndolor sit \namet, \nconsectetur\nadipiscing \nelit. Sed\nac diam nec \npurus mollis \ndictum in at \nsem.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,464],"elapsed":3.585286041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
