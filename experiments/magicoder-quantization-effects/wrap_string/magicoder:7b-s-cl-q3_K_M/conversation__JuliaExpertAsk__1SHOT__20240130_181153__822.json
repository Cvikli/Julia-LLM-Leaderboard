If a word is longer than `text_width`, it throws an error. Otherwise, if adding the next word to the current line would exceed `text_width`, it starts a new line; otherwise, it just adds the next word to the end of the current line. \n\nExample:\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This is a test of the emergency broadcast system\", text_width = 15))\n```\nOutput:\n```\nThis is a \ntest of the \nemergency \nbroadcast \nsystem\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,281],"elapsed":2.169075271,"_type":"aimessage"}]
