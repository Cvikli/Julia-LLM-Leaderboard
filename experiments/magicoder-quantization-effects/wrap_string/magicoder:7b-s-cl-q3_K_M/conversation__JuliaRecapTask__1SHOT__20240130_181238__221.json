[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

It then iterates over each word. If adding this word to the current line would cause it to exceed `text_width`, it adds a newline character, resets `line_length` to 0, and starts a new line. Then it appends the word itself to the current line with a space before it. Finally, it increments `line_length` by one to account for the space that was just added after this word. This results in a string where each line is no longer than `text_width`.\n\nFor example, if we call `wrap_string(\"This is some text. It will be wrapped.\", 10)`, it would return `\"This is \\nsome text.\\nIt will \\nbewrapped.\"`","status":200,"tokens":[0,312],"elapsed":2.460778118,"_type":"aimessage"}]
