It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is a simple way to solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::String; text_width::Int = 10)\n    words = split(s, \" \")\n    wrapped_words = String[]\n    \n    line = \"\"\n    for word in words\n        if length(line * \" $word\") > text_width\n            push!(wrapped_words, line)\n            line = \"\"\n        end\n        line *= \" $word\"\n    end\n    push!(wrapped_words, line)\n    \n    return join(wrapped_words, '\\n')\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a string `s` and an optional argument `text_width` which defaults to 10. It splits the string into words and iterates over each word. When adding a new word would make the current line too long, it adds that line to the result and starts a new one. At the end of the loop, it adds any remaining line to the results. The function then returns the wrapped lines as a single string, with each line separated by a newline character ('\\n').\n\nFor example:\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit\", text_width=15))\n```\nThis would output:\n```\nLorem ipsum \ndolor sit \namet, \nconsectetur \nadipiscing \nelit\n```","status":200,"tokens":[64,341],"elapsed":2.648829428,"_type":"aimessage"}]
