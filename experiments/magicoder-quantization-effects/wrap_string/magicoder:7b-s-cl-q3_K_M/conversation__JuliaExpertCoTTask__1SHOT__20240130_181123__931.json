For each word, it checks whether adding the length of this word to `cur_len` will cause `cur_len` to exceed `text_width`. If so, it adds a newline character to `result` and resets `cur_len`. It then adds the word to `result`, with a space after it. After looping over all words, it joins the elements of `result` into one string with no spaces between them (because we added spaces in our loop). \n\nYou can test this function using:\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\nThe output would be:\n```julia\n\"This\\nfunction\\nwill\\nwrap\\nwords\\ninto\\nlines\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[218,332],"elapsed":12.404272764,"_type":"aimessage"}]
