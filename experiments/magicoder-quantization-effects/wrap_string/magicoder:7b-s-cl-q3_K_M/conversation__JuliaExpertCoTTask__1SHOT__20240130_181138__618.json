It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the solution in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text, text_width=10)::String\n    words = split(text, \" \")\n    result = \"\"\n    for word in words\n        if length(result) + length(word) > text_width\n            result *= \"\\n\"\n        elseif !isempty(result) \n            result *= \" \"\n        end\n        result *= word\n    end\n    return result\nend\n\n# Testing the function\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\nIn this code, the `wrap_string` function takes a string and an optional integer as parameters. If no width is provided it defaults to 10. It splits the text into an array of words. Then it iterates over each word. For each word, if the length of the result so far (including this word) would exceed `text_width`, it adds a new line before this word. If not, it just appends this word to the result. The result is then returned as a string.\nThe example wraps \"This function will wrap words into lines\" every 10 characters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,264],"elapsed":2.033283232,"_type":"aimessage"}]
