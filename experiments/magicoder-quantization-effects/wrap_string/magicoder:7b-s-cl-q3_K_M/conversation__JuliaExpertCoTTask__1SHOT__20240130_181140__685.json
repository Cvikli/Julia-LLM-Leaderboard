If it's not provided, its default value is 10. It splits the input text into words using the built-in `split` function, then iterates through each word in the split array. For each word, it checks if the length of the current result string multiplied by the number of processed words so far would exceed the specified `text_width`. If that's true, it adds a newline character to the result; otherwise, it just appends the word to the end of the result with a space in between.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\", 20))\n```\nThe output would be:\n\n```text\n\"This function will\\nwrap words into\\nlines\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,297],"elapsed":2.3380612,"_type":"aimessage"}]
