By default, `text_width` is 10. The function splits the input string into words using the split function, and then iterates over these words. If adding a word to the current line would result in its length exceeding `text_width`, it pushes the current line onto an array of lines and resets the current line. Then, it adds the current word to the current line, and repeats this process until all words have been processed. Finally, after all words have been processed, it pushes the last line (which might not be a full line if the input string ends with some words that don't exceed `text_width`) onto the array of lines. The function then returns this array of lines.\n\nHere is an example of how to use this function:\n```julia\nprint(wrap_string(\"This is a simple sentence.\", 15))\n```\nThis would print:\n```shell\n\"This is a simple\"\n\"sentence.\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,394],"elapsed":3.020595891,"_type":"aimessage"}]
