If it exceeds `text_width`, we append the current line to the result array (array of lines), reset the current line and start adding the next word. After going through all the words, we push the remaining line in the result array. \n\nHere's an example of how you can use this function:\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\nOutput:\n```\nThis function\nwill wrap words\ninto lines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,286],"elapsed":2.209784763,"_type":"aimessage"}]
