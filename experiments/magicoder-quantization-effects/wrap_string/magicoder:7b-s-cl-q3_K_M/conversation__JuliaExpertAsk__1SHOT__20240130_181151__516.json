It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia code that you asked for:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(words::Array{String, 1}, text_width::Int=10)\n    wrapped_text = \"\"\n    line_length = 0\n\n    for word in words\n        if line_length + length(word) > text_width\n            # If adding a new word would exceed the line width, start a new line\n            wrapped_text *= \"\\n\"\n            line_length = 0\n        end\n        \n        # Add the current word to the text and increment the line length\n        wrapped_text *= word\n        line_length += length(word)\n    end\n    \n    return wrapped_text\nend\n```\n\nThis function iterates over each word in the provided list of words. It checks if adding this word would make the current line longer than `text_width`. If it does, it starts a new line by appending a newline character to `wrapped_text` and resets the line length. Then, it adds the word to `wrapped_text` and increments the line length. The function finally returns the wrapped text as a string.\n\nYou can use this function with some words like below:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Hello\", \"world!\"]\nprintln(wrap_string(words))\n```\nThis will print: \n```\nHello\nworld!\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,317],"elapsed":2.487056939,"_type":"aimessage"}]
