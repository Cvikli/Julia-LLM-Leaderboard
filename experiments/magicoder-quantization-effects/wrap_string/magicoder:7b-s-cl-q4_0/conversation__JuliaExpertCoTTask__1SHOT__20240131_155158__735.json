If any word's length exceeds `text_width`, an error is thrown. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum length of all words. Then, it iterates over the words and adds them to a new line as long as the total length of the current line plus the length of the next word would not exceed `text_width`. If a new line is added, an empty string is added at the beginning of the next line to ensure that there's always a space between words. The result is then printed out.","status":200,"tokens":[218,379],"elapsed":7.109566727,"_type":"aimessage"}]
