It splits the input string into words, then it iterates over each word. If adding the current word to the current line would exceed the `text_width`, it appends the current line to the result (with a newline) and starts a new line with the current word. Otherwise, it just adds the current word to the current line. In the end, it appends the remaining line to the result.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.\", 15))\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nLorem ipsum\ndolor sit\namet, consectetur\nadipiscing elit.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,308],"elapsed":2.391491455,"_type":"aimessage"}]
