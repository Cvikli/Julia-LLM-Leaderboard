If adding a new word to the current line would exceed the maximum width, it starts a new line and adds the current line to the result. Otherwise, it just adds the new word to the current line. The function finally adds the last line to the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,244],"elapsed":1.839893174,"_type":"aimessage"}]
