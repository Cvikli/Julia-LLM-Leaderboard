Then we iterate over each word and add it to `wrapped_text` while keeping track of the current length (the sum of lengths of all characters in `wrapped_text`). If adding a new word would exceed `text_width`, we insert a newline character and reset `current_len`. We also add a space between words, unless it's the first word in the line.\n\nWhen you call `wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")`, it will return:\n```julia\n\"This\\nfunction\\nwill\\nwrap\\nwords\\ninto\\nlines\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,317],"elapsed":2.39318074,"_type":"aimessage"}]
