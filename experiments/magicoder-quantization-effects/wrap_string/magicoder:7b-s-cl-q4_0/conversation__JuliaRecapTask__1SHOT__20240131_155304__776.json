[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

For each word, it checks if adding this word to the current line would exceed the maximum width. If so, it appends the current line (with a newline) to the result and starts a new line with just the current word. Otherwise, it adds the word to the current line. After all words have been processed, it appends the final line to the result.\n\nHere is an example of how you could use this function:\n\n```julia\ns = \"This is a test string that will be wrapped\"\nprintln(wrap_string(s))\n```\n\nThis would print:\n\n```\nThis is \na test \nstring \nthat will \nbe wrapped\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,296],"elapsed":2.271969885,"_type":"aimessage"}]
