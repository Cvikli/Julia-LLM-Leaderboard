Then, we iterate over these words and keep adding them to `current_str` while checking if its length exceeds `text_width`. If it does, we add `current_str` to `str_arr`, reset `current_str`, and then continue with the next word. Finally, after the loop ends, we add any remaining text to `str_arr`. Then, we return `join(str_arr, \"\\n\")`, which joins all elements of `str_arr` into a string with newline characters between each element.","status":200,"tokens":[94,344],"elapsed":2.689228401,"_type":"aimessage"}]
