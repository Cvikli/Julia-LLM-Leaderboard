Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.\", 20))\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the input string into words and then iterating over each word. It checks if adding a new word to the current line would exceed the maximum text width, and if so, it adds the current line to the result and starts a new one. At the end of the iteration, it adds the last line to the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,274],"elapsed":2.056861828,"_type":"aimessage"}]
