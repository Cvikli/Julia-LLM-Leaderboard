It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded.

If so, a new line is added, otherwise the word is simply appended to the current line (with a space in between). The resulting string is then returned.\n\nExample: \n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\", 15))\n```\nOutput:\n```\n\"This function \nwill wrap \nwords into \nlines\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,234],"elapsed":1.766665759,"_type":"aimessage"}]
