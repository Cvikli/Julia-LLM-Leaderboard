For each word, we check if appending it to `line` would exceed our maximum line length (`text_width`). If it would exceed the maximum width, we add `line` to our list of lines and start a new `line` with just this word. Otherwise, we append the word to `line`. After all words have been processed, we make sure to add the last `line` to our list. We then join all the lines together with newline characters and return the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,281],"elapsed":2.134809996,"_type":"aimessage"}]
