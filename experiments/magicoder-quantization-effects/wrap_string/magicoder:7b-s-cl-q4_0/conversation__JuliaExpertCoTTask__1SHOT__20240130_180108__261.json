If it does, it appends the current line (with newline character) to the result, clears the current line and starts a new line with the current word. If adding the current word to the line doesn't exceed the width, it just adds the word to the line. At the end of the loop, it appends the last line (with newline character) to the result.\n\nAn example usage:\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\", 10))\n```\nThis code will print:\n```text\nThis function \nwill wrap \nwords \ninto \nlines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,303],"elapsed":2.322697677,"_type":"aimessage"}]
