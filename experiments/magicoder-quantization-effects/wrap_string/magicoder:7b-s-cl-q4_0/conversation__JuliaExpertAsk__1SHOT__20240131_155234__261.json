It splits the input string into words, then for each word, it checks if adding this word to the current line exceeds the maximum allowed width. If so, it adds the current line to the result (with a newline) and starts a new line with just this word. Otherwise, it just adds the word to the current line. Finally, after all words have been processed, it appends the remaining line to the result.\n\nAn example usage:\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.\", 15))\n```\nThis would output:\n```\nLorem ipsum\ndolor sit\namet, \nconsectetur\nadipiscing\nelit.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,318],"elapsed":2.383748703,"_type":"aimessage"}]
