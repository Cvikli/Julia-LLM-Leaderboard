It's quite long.\", 10))\n```\nIn this code, `split` is used to split the input string by spaces to get individual words. Then for each word in words, we add it to the resultant string after checking if adding this word would exceed the maximum allowed width. If it does, we append a newline character and reset our current_length counter.\n\nFinally, we print out the results of `wrap_string` with your example string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,255],"elapsed":1.922123819,"_type":"aimessage"}]
