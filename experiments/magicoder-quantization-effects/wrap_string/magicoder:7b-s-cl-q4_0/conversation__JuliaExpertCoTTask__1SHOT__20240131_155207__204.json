It splits the input string into words, then iterates over these words. If adding a new word to the current line would exceed the `text_width`, it appends the current line to the result (with a newline) and starts a new line with the current word. Otherwise, it just adds the word to the current line. Finally, it appends the last line to the result without a newline.\n\nHere is an example:\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\nOutput: \n```\nThis function\nwill wrap\nwords into\nlines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,282],"elapsed":2.139887803,"_type":"aimessage"}]
