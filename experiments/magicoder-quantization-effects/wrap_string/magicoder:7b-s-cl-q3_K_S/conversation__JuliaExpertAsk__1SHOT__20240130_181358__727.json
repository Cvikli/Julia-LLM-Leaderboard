This is a test string\"\nprintln(wrap_string(s))  # Output: \n# Hello world.\n# This is a test string\n```\n\nThis `wrap_string()` function takes in a string, splits it into words and checks each word if adding it to the current line would exceed the maximum width. If it does, it pushes the current line to the result array and starts a new line. The process continues for every word until all words are exhausted, then the function joins all lines with newline characters between them before returning the final string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,302],"elapsed":2.361399932,"_type":"aimessage"}]
