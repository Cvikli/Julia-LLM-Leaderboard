It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia code for your request:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(str, text_width = 10)\n    words = split(str, \" \")\n    str_new = \"\"\n    line_length = 0\n    for word in words\n        if line_length + length(word) > text_width\n            str_new *= \"\\n\"\n            line_length = 0\n        elseif !isempty(str_new)\n            str_new *= \" \"\n        end\n        str_new *= word\n        line_length += length(word)+1 # Plus one for the space separator.\n    end\n    return str_new\nend\n```\nThis function splits input string into words and add a new line (`\\n`) whenever it exceeds `text_width`. It also takes care of leading/trailing spaces in each line. You can test this function with following code:\n\n```julia\nstr = \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(str, 10)) # Output will be different every time because it's randomly generated\n```\nNote: This solution assumes that you want to wrap your text at spaces. If you need a different wrapping behavior (e.g., breaking the words in the middle), please provide additional details.","status":200,"tokens":[0,306],"elapsed":2.398697233,"_type":"aimessage"}]
