It splits the input string into words and iterates through each word, adding it to the current line if the length of the resulting line does not exceed the `text_width`. When the length limit is reached, it starts a new line in the list of lines for the final output. If there are remaining words after all lines have been filled, they are added as their own individual lines.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nstr = \"Hello world\"\ntext_width = 12\nprintln(wrap_string(str, text_width)) # Outputs: \"Hello\\nworld\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,302],"elapsed":2.361471934,"_type":"aimessage"}]
