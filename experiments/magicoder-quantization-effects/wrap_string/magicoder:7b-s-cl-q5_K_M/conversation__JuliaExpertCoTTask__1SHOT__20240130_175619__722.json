It then iterates over these words, checking at each iteration if adding the length of the current word to `current_line_length` will exceed `text_width`. If it does, we create a new line with the words up to that point and continue from there on a new line.\n\nLet's test this function:\n\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\nThe output will be:\n\n```julia\nThis \nfunction \nwill \nwrap \nwords \ninto \nlines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,324],"elapsed":2.840599185,"_type":"aimessage"}]
