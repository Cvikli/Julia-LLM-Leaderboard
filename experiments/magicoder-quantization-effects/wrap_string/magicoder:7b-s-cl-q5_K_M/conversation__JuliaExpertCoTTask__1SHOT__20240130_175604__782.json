Here's how you might do it:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::String; text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(s, \" \")\n    result = \"\"\n    current_line_length = 0\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(word) > text_width - current_line_length\n            result *= \"\\n\"\n            current_line_length = 0\n        end\n        \n        result *= \" $word\"\n        current_line_length += length(word) + 1 # account for the space character\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\nThis function splits the input string into words using `split`. It then iterates over each word. If adding the current word to the existing line would exceed `text_width`, it adds a newline character to start a new line, and resets `current_line_length` to 0. Then it adds the word with a space in between to the result string, and updates `current_line_length`.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\nThis should output:\n```\nThis function \nwill wrap words \ninto lines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[218,315],"elapsed":8.345266979,"_type":"aimessage"}]
