For each word, it checks if adding this word to the current line would exceed `text_width` characters. If so, it starts a new line. It also adds a space after each word except for the first word in the line.\n\nLet's test with your example:\n```julia\nprint(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,249],"elapsed":2.177147764,"_type":"aimessage"}]
