Then it iterates over these words and adds each word to the current line until reaching the maximum width (default is 10). Once this maximum is exceeded, it starts a new line with the next word. The function then joins all lines with newline characters and returns the result.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This is a test string\"))\n# Output:\n# This is\n# a test\n# string\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,276],"elapsed":2.401069097,"_type":"aimessage"}]
