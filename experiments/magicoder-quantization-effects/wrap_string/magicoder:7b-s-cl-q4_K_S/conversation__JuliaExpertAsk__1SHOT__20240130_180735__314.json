It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can solve this problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(s, \" \")  # split the string into an array of words\n    result = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(result) + length(word) > text_width\n            result *= \"\\n\" * word  # add a newline and start a new line\n        elseif !isempty(result)\n            result *= \" \" * word  # append a space and the next word\n        else\n            result *= word  # just append the word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the input string into an array of words. Then, it iterates over these words, appending each one to `result` and adding a newline if the current line would be longer than `text_width`. If not, it simply adds a space. If this is the first word in the result string, no space or newline are added before it.\n\nExample:\n```julia\nprint(wrap_string(\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit\", 10))\n```\nThis would output:\n```\nLorem\nipsum\ndolor\nsit\namet,\nconsectetur\nadipiscing\nelit\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,320],"elapsed":2.467789577,"_type":"aimessage"}]
