[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's the Julia code snippet for your problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::AbstractString; text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(s, \" \")\n    lines = String[]\n    current_line = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line * \" $word\") > text_width\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = \"$word\"\n        elseif isempty(current_line)\n            current_line = \"$word\"\n        else\n            current_line *= \" $word\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    if !isempty(current_line)\n        push!(lines, current_line)\n    end\n\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n\n# Test the function:\ns = \"This is a sample string to test wrapping functionality.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(s; text_width=15))  # Max width of each line is 15 characters.\n```\n\nIn this code, `split` function is used to split the given string into words, and then it checks for every word whether it can be added in a current line or not, if not it will push the previous line to lines array and start a new one. This process is repeated until all words are checked and processed.\n\nYou can use `{{instructions}}` as instructions for the function where necessary. The above function takes an input string and a maximum width of each line, by default 10 characters. If you want to change it, just pass your desired width with `text_width=desired_width`. Then this function will return a multi-line string with each line having at most the specified character length.","status":200,"tokens":[0,390],"elapsed":3.108632022,"_type":"aimessage"}]
