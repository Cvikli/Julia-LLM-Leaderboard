If not, it adds the word to the current line. In the end, it joins all lines with newline characters to form the final result.\n\nTesting the function with provided example:\n\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\n\nShould print this text:\n```\n\"This function \nwill wrap \nwords \ninto \nlines\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,344],"elapsed":2.681163704,"_type":"aimessage"}]
