Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the `wrap_string` function in Julia that does exactly what you described:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(s, ' ')\n    wrapped_text = \"\"\n    line = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        if length(line * \" $word\") > text_width\n            wrapped_text *= \"\\n$line\"\n            line = \"\"\n        end \n        line *= \" $word\"\n    end\n\n    # Add the remaining line at the end.\n    wrapped_text *= \"\\n$line\"\n\n    return wrapped_text\nend\n```\nThis function first splits the input string into words, then it iterates over each word. For each word, it checks if adding this word to the current line would exceed the maximum width. If so, it adds that line to the result and starts a new one with just this word. Finally, it adds any remaining words in the last line to the result.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\ns = \"This is a sample string that will be wrapped depending on its length\"\nprintln(wrap_string(s))\n```\nIn this case, the `text_width` defaults to 10 characters. The resulting output would wrap around at each occurrence of 10 characters:\n\n```julia\nThis is a\nsample string\nthat will be\nwrapped depending on its length\n```","status":200,"tokens":[64,341],"elapsed":2.927441082,"_type":"aimessage"}]
