Here is how you'd run it:\n\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\nThe `split` function breaks down a string into an array of substrings based on a delimiter (in this case, spaces). The code then loops through each word in the array. If adding another word would exceed the maximum width, it starts a new line. It builds up the final result string by appending newline characters and words to `result`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,246],"elapsed":2.107935291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
