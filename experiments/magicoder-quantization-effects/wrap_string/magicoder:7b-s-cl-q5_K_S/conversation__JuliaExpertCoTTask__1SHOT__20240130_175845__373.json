Then we iterate over each word in the list. Before adding a new word to the current line, we check if adding that word would exceed the maximum width. If so, we start a new line. We also add a space between words unless there is already a newline at the beginning of the output string and we have not added any other characters yet (to avoid leading whitespace).\n\nThe resulting string is printed to the console in this example. The `text_width` parameter can be modified to adjust how many characters per line you want.","status":200,"tokens":[0,307],"elapsed":2.653701033,"_type":"aimessage"}]
