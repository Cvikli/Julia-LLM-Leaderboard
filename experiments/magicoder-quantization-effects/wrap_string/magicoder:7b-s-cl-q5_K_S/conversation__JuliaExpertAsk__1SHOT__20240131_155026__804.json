Sed nec diam eget turpis lacinia mollis.\"\nprint(wrap_string(s))\n```\n\nThis function splits the input string into words and then iterates over each word. It checks if adding a new word to the current line will exceed `text_width`. If it does, it adds the current line to the list of lines and starts a new one. After all words have been processed, it adds the last line to the list of lines. The function finally returns the joined lines with newline characters in between.","status":200,"tokens":[0,292],"elapsed":2.465957885,"_type":"aimessage"}]
