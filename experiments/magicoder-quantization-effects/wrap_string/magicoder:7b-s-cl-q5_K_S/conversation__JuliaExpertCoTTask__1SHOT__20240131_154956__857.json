It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded.

Then we iterate over these words. For each word, we check if adding it to the current line would exceed our maximum width. If so, we add that line to the result and start a new line. We then add the word to the current line. At the end, we add the last line to the result.\n\nThe example uses `println` to print out the resulting string. The text will be wrapped at 15 characters per line.","status":200,"tokens":[0,254],"elapsed":2.154723118,"_type":"aimessage"}]
