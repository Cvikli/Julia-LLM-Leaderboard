If adding a new word to the current line would exceed `text_width`, it prints the current line, resets the current line, and then adds the new word. If no newline needs to be printed for this word, it just appends the word to the current line. At the end of all words, it always prints out the remaining string as a last line.\n\nTo test our function with your data:\n```julia\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[218,244],"elapsed":13.988797435,"_type":"aimessage"}]
