[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

For each word in the list, it checks if adding that word to the current line (including a space before it) would exceed `text_width`. If so, it adds the current line to the result lines and starts a new line with just that word. Otherwise, it adds the word to the current line. After looping over all words, it adds any remaining words in the current line. Finally, it joins all lines together into a single string with newline characters between each line.\n\nHere is an example usage:\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This is a test of my program's ability to handle very long lines.\", 10))\n```\nThe output would be:\n```bash\nThis is a\ntest of my\nprogram's\nability to\nhandle very\nlong lines.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,346],"elapsed":3.041429286,"_type":"aimessage"}]
