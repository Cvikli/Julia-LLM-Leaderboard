For each word, it checks if adding this word to the current line would exceed the maximum `text_width`. If so, it appends the current line to the result (with a newline character) and starts a new line with just the current word. Otherwise, it adds the word to the current line. At the end of the function, it appends the last line to the result.\n\nHere is an example usage:\n\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nThis function\nwill wrap words\ninto lines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,275],"elapsed":2.373677338,"_type":"aimessage"}]
