If so, a new line is started. The function finally returns the final string with lines separated by newline characters.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This is a test string\", 20))\n```\nOutput:\n```\nThis is a test\nstring\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,225],"elapsed":1.895305964,"_type":"aimessage"}]
