It splits the string into words by spaces, then it iterates over each word. If adding the current word to the end of what has already been written would exceed `text_width`, it adds a newline character to `result` and resets `line_length` to 0. Then it adds the current word to `result` followed by a space, updating `line_length`. After all words are processed, it returns `result`.\n\nPlease note that in this case \"this is a\" and \"string.\" are treated as separate sentences because they have a space after them. If you want to keep these together regardless of spaces, you would need to adjust the logic inside the loop to count non-space characters instead of words.","status":200,"tokens":[0,379],"elapsed":3.254299002,"_type":"aimessage"}]
