If it does, it appends the current line to the list of lines and starts a new one. It then adds each word to the end of the current line. After going through all the words, it appends the last line to the list of lines. Finally, it joins all the lines into a single string with newline characters between them and returns that string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,301],"elapsed":2.555234217,"_type":"aimessage"}]
