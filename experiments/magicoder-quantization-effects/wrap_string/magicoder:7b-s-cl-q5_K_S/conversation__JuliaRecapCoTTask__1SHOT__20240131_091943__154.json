[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded.

If you want to change the default width, you can pass it as an argument when calling the function: `wrap_string(\"Hello World\", 20)`.\n\nThe function works by splitting the input string into words and then iterating over these words. For each word, it checks if adding this word to the current line would exceed the maximum allowed width. If so, it adds the current line to the result (with a newline at the end) and starts a new line with just this word. If not, it simply adds this word to the current line. After iterating over all words, it adds the final line to the result.\n\nYou can use the function like this:\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"Hello World\"))\n```\nThis will print:\n```\nHello World\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,318],"elapsed":2.815134714,"_type":"aimessage"}]
