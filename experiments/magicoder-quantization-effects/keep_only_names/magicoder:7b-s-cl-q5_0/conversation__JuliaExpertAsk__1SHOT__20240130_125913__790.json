The condition `isuppercase(first(word))` checks if the first character of a word is an uppercase letter. Words for which this condition returns true are kept, and those that return false are removed.\n\nYou can call this function with a list of words like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"bird\"]\nkeep_only_names(words)\n```\nThis would return `[\"Cat\", \"Dog\"]`, because only the words that start with an uppercase letter are kept.","status":200,"tokens":[0,191],"elapsed":1.636232842,"_type":"aimessage"}]
