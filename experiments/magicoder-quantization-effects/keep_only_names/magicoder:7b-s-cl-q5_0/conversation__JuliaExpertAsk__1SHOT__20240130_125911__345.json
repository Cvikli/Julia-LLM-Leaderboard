Here is a simple way to solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(word -> startswith(word, uppercase(first(word))), words)\nend\n```\nThis function uses the built-in `filter` and `startswith` functions to check if each word in the input list `words` starts with a capital letter. The `uppercase` function is used to make sure that we are comparing with an uppercase version of the first character, even if the original word had lowercase letters at this position.\n\nYou can use it like so:\n```julia\nnames = [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Bear\", \"Elephant\", \"Ant\"]\nfiltered_names = keep_only_names(names)\nprintln(filtered_names)  # This will print: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,207],"elapsed":1.77333488,"_type":"aimessage"}]
