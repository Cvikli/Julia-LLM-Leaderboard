The predicate in this case is a lambda function which checks if the first character of a word is uppercase. The `uppercase(first(x))` call converts the first letter to its uppercase equivalent for comparison.\n\nYou can use it like so:\n```julia\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])\n```\nThis will return `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`. The word \"dog\" has been removed as it doesn't start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,199],"elapsed":1.717444862,"_type":"aimessage"}]
