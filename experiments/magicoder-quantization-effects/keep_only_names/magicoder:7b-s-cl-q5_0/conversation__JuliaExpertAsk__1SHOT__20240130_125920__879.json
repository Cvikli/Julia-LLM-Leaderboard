If the first character of the word is uppercase (checked with `isuppercase(word[1])`), it's added to a new list (`new_list`) which is returned at the end.\n\nThe function can be tested like this:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\", \"dog\", \"DOG\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"DOG\"]\n```\nPlease note that this code is case sensitive and will not consider \"Cat\" or \"dog\" as valid names. If you want to treat all letters as lowercase, use `islowercase(word[1])` instead of `isuppercase(word[1])`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,251],"elapsed":2.152374672,"_type":"aimessage"}]
