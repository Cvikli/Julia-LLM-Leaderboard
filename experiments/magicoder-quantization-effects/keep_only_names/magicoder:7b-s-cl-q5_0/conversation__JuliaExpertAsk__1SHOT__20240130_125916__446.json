The `if` statement checks whether the first character of the word (indexed by `word[1]`) is a capital letter by comparing it with the uppercase version of that same character. If they match, the word is added to the result.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\"]\nfiltered_names = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_names) # Outputs: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,198],"elapsed":1.687882885,"_type":"aimessage"}]
