[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia function `keep_only_names` which solves the problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    result = []  # Create an empty list to store the names that start with a capital letter\n    for word in words  # Iterate over each word in the provided list\n        if isuppercasefirstletter(word)  # Check whether the first character of the word is uppercase\n            push!(result, word)  # If true, add the word to the result list\n        end\n    end\n    return result  # Return the final result list\nend\n```\nThis function iterates over each word in the provided list and checks whether it starts with an uppercase letter. If it does, this word is added to a new list which is then returned as the output of the function. \n\nPlease note that `isuppercasefirstletter` is not a built-in Julia function, so we need to define it:\n```julia\nfunction isuppercasefirstletter(word)\n    return word[1] == uppercase(word[1])\nend\n```\nThis checks whether the first character of `word` is an uppercase letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,263],"elapsed":2.320313311,"_type":"aimessage"}]
