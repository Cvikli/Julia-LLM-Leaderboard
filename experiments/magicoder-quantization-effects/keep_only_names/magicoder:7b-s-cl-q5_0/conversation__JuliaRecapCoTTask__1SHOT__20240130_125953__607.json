[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, Here is the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    newWords = [] # Initialize an empty list to store filtered words\n    for word in words \n        if isupper(word[1])\n            push!(newWords, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return newWords\nend\n```\nThis function iterates over each word in the provided list `words`. If the first character of a word (represented by `word[1]`) is an uppercase letter (checked with `isupper`), it pushes that word into the `newWords` list. At the end, it returns the `newWords` list.\n\nPlease note, Julia has zero-based indexing system. So the first character of a word is at position 1 instead of 0 like in most other programming languages.","status":200,"tokens":[11,192],"elapsed":1.695151819,"_type":"aimessage"}]
