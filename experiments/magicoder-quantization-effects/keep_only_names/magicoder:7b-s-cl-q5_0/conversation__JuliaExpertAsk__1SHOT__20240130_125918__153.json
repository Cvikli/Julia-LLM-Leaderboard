For each word, it checks whether the first character is lowercase (using `islowercase` method). If it's not (meaning the first character is uppercase), it adds that word to a new list (`new_list`). In the end, it returns the new list of words that start with a capital letter.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"Elephant\"]\nprint(keep_only_names(words)) # prints: [\"Cat\", \"Dog\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,259],"elapsed":2.214210396,"_type":"aimessage"}]
