The condition within the list comprehension (`startswith(word, uppercase(first(word)))`) checks if the first character of each word is an uppercase letter, which will correctly identify words that start with a capital letter and exclude those that don't. The resultant list of words that pass this condition is then returned by the function.\n\nWe can test our function on your provided data:\n```julia\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])\n```\n\nThis will return `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`, which are the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,213],"elapsed":1.839562942,"_type":"aimessage"}]
