Here is a simple function written in Julia that does exactly what you asked. It filters out any word from an input list of strings `words` which don't begin with an uppercase character:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Initialize an empty array to store the results\n    result = []\n    \n    for word in words\n        # Check if first character is uppercase\n        if isuppercase(word[1])\n            # If it is, add this word to our result\n            push!(result, word)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each word in the input list. For each word, it checks if the first character (at index 1 because indexing starts at 1 in Julia) is uppercase using the built-in `isuppercase` function. If the character is uppercase, it adds the word to the result array. At the end of the function, the result array is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,224],"elapsed":2.012169747,"_type":"aimessage"}]
