Here's an example:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    [word for word in words if isupper(first(word))]\nend\n``` \nThis function uses Julia's built-in `isupper` function to check whether the first character of a word (`first(word)`) is an uppercase letter. If it is, the word is included in the list that gets returned by the comprehension. If not, the word is skipped. \n\nHere's how you can call this function:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words)) # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Elephant\"]\n``` \nThis will keep only the words that start with a capital letter, discarding the others.","status":200,"tokens":[0,208],"elapsed":1.878799733,"_type":"aimessage"}]
