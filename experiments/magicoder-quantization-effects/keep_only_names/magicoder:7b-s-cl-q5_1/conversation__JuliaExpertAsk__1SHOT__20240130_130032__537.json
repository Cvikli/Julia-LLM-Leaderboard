If it is, then the word is included in the result list. \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that we are considering words as individual strings and not characters. Also, in case when you have non-English letters and want to check only for English capitalized letters, you may need to use `isascii(first(word))` instead of `isuppercase(first(word))`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,153],"elapsed":1.41197752,"_type":"aimessage"}]
