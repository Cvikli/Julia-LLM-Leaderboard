It then returns all elements for which the predicate is true. \n\nIn this case, the predicate function checks whether the first character of the word (`x`) is equal to its uppercase version (`uppercase(first(x))`). Only words whose first character is a capital letter pass the test and are included in the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,166],"elapsed":1.510274875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
