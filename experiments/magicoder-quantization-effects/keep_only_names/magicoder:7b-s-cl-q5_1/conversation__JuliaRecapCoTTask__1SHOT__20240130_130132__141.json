[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filtered_list = [] # Initializing an empty list\n    for word in words \n        if isuppercase(word[1]) # Checking if the first character of the word is uppercase (i.e., a capital letter)\n            push!(filtered_list, word) # If true, append this word to the filtered list\n        end\n    end\n    return filtered_list\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we loop through each `word` in the provided list of words (`words`). We check if the first character of `word` is an uppercase letter using `isuppercase(word[1])`. If it's true, then we append this word to our `filtered_list`. At the end, we return this filtered list.\n\nNote that the function assumes that words are stored as strings and checks only the first character of each string to determine if it is uppercase or not. It doesn't check whether all characters in a word should be capitalized, or if there should be other rules for determining whether a word is valid. If you have different requirements, you will need to modify this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,276],"elapsed":2.534817393,"_type":"aimessage"}]
