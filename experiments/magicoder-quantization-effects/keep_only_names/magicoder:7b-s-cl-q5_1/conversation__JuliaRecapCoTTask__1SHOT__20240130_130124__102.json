[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is a basic way to solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(w -> w[1] == uppercase(first(w)), words)\nend\n```\n\nThis function `keep_only_names` uses the built-in `filter` function from the Base package in Julia. This function iterates over every element `w` of the input array `words`, and for each `w`, it checks if the first character (`w[1]`) is equal to its uppercase version (`uppercase(first(w))`). If so, it keeps this word; otherwise it removes it (since it doesn't start with a capital letter). \n\nThis solution assumes that all words are strings. If you want to handle other types of input or edge cases, you may need to add additional checks based on the specific requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,196],"elapsed":1.817643943,"_type":"aimessage"}]
