[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem using the following steps:\n- Create an empty list to store the output words.\n- Loop over each word in the input list.\n- Check if the first character of the current word is a capital letter. If it is, add the word to the output list.\n\nHere is how you can solve this problem using Julia programming language:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)::Array{String, 1}\n    names = []\n    for word in words\n        if word[1] == uppercase(word[1])\n            push!(names, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return names\nend\n```\nThis function creates an empty array `names` and then iterates over each `word` in the input list. It checks whether the first character of a word (which is `word[1]`) is a capital letter by comparing it to its uppercase version (`uppercase(word[1])`). If it is, it pushes this word into the `names` array. At the end, it returns the `names` array which contains only those words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,251],"elapsed":1.95327996,"_type":"aimessage"}]
