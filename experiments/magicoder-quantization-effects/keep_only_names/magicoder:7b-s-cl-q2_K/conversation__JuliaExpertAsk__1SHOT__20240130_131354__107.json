We then loop over each word in the input list `words`. If a particular word starts with a capital letter (i.e., its first character is a capitalized version of itself), we add it to `new_list`. Finally, we return the resulting array.","status":200,"tokens":[0,157],"elapsed":1.18360007,"_type":"aimessage"}]
