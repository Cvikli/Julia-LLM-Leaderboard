If a word starts with a capital letter (which is checked using the built-in Julia function `isupper(word[1])`), it's added to `new_list`. Finally, when all words have been processed, the function returns the list `new_list`, which contains only the words that started with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,248],"elapsed":1.877304482,"_type":"aimessage"}]
