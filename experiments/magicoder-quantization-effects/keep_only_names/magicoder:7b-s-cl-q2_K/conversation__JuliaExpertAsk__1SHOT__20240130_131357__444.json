We then iterate over each word in the input list `words`. If the length of the word is more than 0 and the first character is uppercase (using the built-in `isupper` function), we push it into our names array. Finally, after the loop finishes executing, we return the `names` array containing only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,190],"elapsed":1.439936169,"_type":"aimessage"}]
