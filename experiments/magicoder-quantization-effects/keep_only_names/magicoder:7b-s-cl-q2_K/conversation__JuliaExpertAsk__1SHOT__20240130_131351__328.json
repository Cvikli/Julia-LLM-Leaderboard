For each word, if it is capitalized and not empty (i.e., it has some characters), then we add it to the resultant array.\n\nNote: This code assumes that words are stored in an Array of Strings (`String[]`), where each string is a single word. If your list of words is stored in another format, you would need to adjust this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[98,231],"elapsed":1.775955557,"_type":"aimessage"}]
