The anonymous function passed to `filter` checks if the first character of a word is an uppercase letter, and only includes those that are. Thus, it keeps only words that start with a capital letter.\n\nHere's how you could use this function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"DOG\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"DOG\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,199],"elapsed":1.577940394,"_type":"aimessage"}]
