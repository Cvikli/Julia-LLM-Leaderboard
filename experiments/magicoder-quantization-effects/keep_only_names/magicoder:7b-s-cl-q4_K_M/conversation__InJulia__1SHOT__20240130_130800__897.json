It then adds words that pass this check to the resulting list. If a word is empty (which would happen if there were leading spaces), it also gets added, as we do not want to filter out empty strings.\n\nYou can call the function with a list of words like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\", \"\", \"dOg\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,255],"elapsed":2.042209259,"_type":"aimessage"}]
