[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution for this problem using Julia. The `keep_only_names` function checks if each word in the list starts with an uppercase letter and only keeps those words that do:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filter(x -> x[1] == uppercase(x[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, `filter` is a higher-order function in Julia. It applies the anonymous function (the expression after the `->`) to each element of the collection (in this case, the list of words). The condition (`x -> x[1] == uppercase(x[1])`) checks if the first character of a word is an uppercase letter. If it is, then that word is kept; otherwise, it's removed.\n\nFor example, `keep_only_names([\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\"])` would return `[\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,214],"elapsed":1.741973386,"_type":"aimessage"}]
