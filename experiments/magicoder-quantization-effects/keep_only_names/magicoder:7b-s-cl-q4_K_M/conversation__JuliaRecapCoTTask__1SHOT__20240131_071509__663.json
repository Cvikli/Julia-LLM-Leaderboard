[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(x -> isuppercase(first(x)), words)\nend\n```\nThis function uses the built-in `filter` function to iterate over each word in the list and checks if the first character of the string (which represents the whole word) is uppercase. If it's not, it gets removed from the final result. \n\nIf you want to use a for loop instead:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    result = String[]\n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(first(word))\n            push!(result, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\nThis function does the same thing but manually iterates over each word. It creates an empty list `result` and then checks each word one by one. If it finds a word that starts with an uppercase letter, it adds this word to the `result` list. Finally, it returns the `result` list which contains only words that start with an uppercase letter.","status":200,"tokens":[11,254],"elapsed":2.059336863,"_type":"aimessage"}]
