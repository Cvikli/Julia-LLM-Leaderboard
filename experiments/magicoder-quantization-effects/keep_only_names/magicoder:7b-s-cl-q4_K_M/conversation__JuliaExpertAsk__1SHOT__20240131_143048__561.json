The `isuppercase` function checks if a character is an uppercase letter.\n\nYou can call this function with a list of words as follows:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"dog\", \"DOG\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # prints: [\"Dog\", \"DOG\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,168],"elapsed":1.329542845,"_type":"aimessage"}]
