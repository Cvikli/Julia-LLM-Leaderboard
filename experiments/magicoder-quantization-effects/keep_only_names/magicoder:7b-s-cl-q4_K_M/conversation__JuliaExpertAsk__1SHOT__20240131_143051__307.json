The `uppercase(first(x))` part is used to ensure that we're checking for a capital letter at the beginning of the string, not anywhere within it. \n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"dog\", \"cat\", \"DOG\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words)) # Outputs: [\"Dog\", \"DOG\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,180],"elapsed":1.429810679,"_type":"aimessage"}]
