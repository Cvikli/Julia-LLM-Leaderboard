The condition is that the first character of each word must be a capital letter (as checked by `first(w) == uppercase(first(w))`). This ensures that only words starting with a capital letter are kept.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"dog\", \"Cat1\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,188],"elapsed":1.50093874,"_type":"aimessage"}]
