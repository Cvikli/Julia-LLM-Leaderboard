Here is the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    [word for word in words if isupper(first(word))]\nend\n```\nThis function uses `isupper` to check whether the first character of a word is an uppercase letter and `first` to get the first character. It then returns a new list that contains only those words which meet this condition, effectively removing any words that don't start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,133],"elapsed":1.061459069,"_type":"aimessage"}]
