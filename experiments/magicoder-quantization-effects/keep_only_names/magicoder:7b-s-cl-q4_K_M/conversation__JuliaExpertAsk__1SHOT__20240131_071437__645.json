The `startswith` function checks if a string starts with another string (in this case, it checks if a word starts with a capital letter). If the condition is true (`startswith(x, uppercase(first(x)))`), then the word is kept; otherwise, it's removed from the list.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"doggy\", \"Cat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Outputs: [\"Dog\", \"Bird\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,210],"elapsed":1.662555279,"_type":"aimessage"}]
