[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The `keep_only_names` function can be implemented in Julia as follows:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filter!(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\nThis function uses the built-in `filter!` function which modifies an array it's called on by keeping only elements that satisfy a given predicate, and returns `nothing`. In this case, the predicate checks if the first character of each word is uppercase. \n\nIn this context, `first(word)` gets the first (and in this case single) character of the string `word`, and `isuppercase(ch)` checks whether the character `ch` is an uppercase letter. The expression `word -> isuppercase(first(word))` is a so-called anonymous function that takes a word as input and returns whether the first character of that word is uppercase, which is exactly what we need here.\n\nPlease replace {{instructions}} with your specific instructions if there are any.","status":200,"tokens":[0,225],"elapsed":1.846129202,"_type":"aimessage"}]
