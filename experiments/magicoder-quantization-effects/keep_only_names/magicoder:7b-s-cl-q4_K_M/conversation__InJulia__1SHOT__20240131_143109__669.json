It checks if the first character of the word is uppercase (using the `isuppercase` function), and if it is, then it adds that word to a new list (`result`). The condition `length(word) > 1` is used to ensure that we don't include words which are just one letter long.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\", \"DOG\", \"dOg\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))  # Output: String[\"Dog\", \"DOG\", \"Dog\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,239],"elapsed":1.894139873,"_type":"aimessage"}]
