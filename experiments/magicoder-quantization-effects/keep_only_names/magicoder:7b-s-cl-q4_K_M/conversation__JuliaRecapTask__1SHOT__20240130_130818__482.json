[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is your solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Use filter to keep only those words that start with a capital letter\n    return filter(word -> word[1] == uppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\nYou can call this function like `keep_only_names([\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"elephant\"])` which would return `[\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]`. The function uses the built-in `filter` function that applies a predicate (a condition) to each element in an array and returns a new array with elements that satisfy the condition. In this case, we are filtering out words that do not start with a capital letter. \n\nThe `uppercase(word[1])` is used to check if the first character of a word is uppercase. The `==` operator checks for equality between two characters, which will be either true or false depending on whether they are identical or not. If it's true then we keep that word else we remove it from the list.","status":200,"tokens":[0,236],"elapsed":1.917922004,"_type":"aimessage"}]
