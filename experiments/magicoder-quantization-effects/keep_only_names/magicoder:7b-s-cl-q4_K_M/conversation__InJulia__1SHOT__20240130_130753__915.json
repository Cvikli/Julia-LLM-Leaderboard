The `filter` function iterates over each element in an input collection (the `words` list), applying a test to it, and collecting all elements for which the test is true. Here, that test is whether the first character of a word is uppercase (using `first(x)` to get the first character and `uppercase(first(x))` to ensure it's an uppercase letter).\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"cat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Prints: Cat Dog\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,231],"elapsed":1.865172793,"_type":"aimessage"}]
