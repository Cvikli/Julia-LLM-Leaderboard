For each word, it checks whether the first character (at index 1 because indexing in Julia starts from 1) is uppercase using the built-in `isuppercase` function. If this condition holds true, the word is added to the result array. Finally, the result array is returned.\n\nYou can use it like this:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\", \"dog\"]\nprint(keep_only_names(words))  # prints [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,210],"elapsed":1.664779364,"_type":"aimessage"}]
