[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function in Julia that accomplishes this task:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    result = String[]  # initialize an empty array to store the names\n    for word in words  # iterate over each word in words\n        if startswith(word, uppercase(first(word)))  # check if the word starts with a capital letter\n            push!(result, word)  # if so, add it to result\n        end\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes an array of strings as input and returns another array. It iterates over each string in the input array, checks whether the first character is a capital letter (using `startswith` and `uppercase`), and if it is, adds it to the output array (`result`). \n\nIn Julia, we use `push!` to add elements to an array since arrays are mutable. We also use `first(word)` to get the first character of a string and `uppercase(first(word))` to convert that character to uppercase (since `startswith` is case sensitive). \n\nPlease note that this function will remove words like \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\". If you want to remove both, you can use a simple modification:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    result = String[]  # initialize an empty array to store the names\n    for word in words  # iterate over each word in words\n        if isuppercase(first(word))  # check if the first character is uppercase\n            push!(result, word)  # if so, add it to result\n        end\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,376],"elapsed":3.083441779,"_type":"aimessage"}]
