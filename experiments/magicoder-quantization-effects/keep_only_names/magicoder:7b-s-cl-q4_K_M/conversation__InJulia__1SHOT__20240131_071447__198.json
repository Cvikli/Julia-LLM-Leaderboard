The `startswith` function checks if the first character of a string matches another string (in this case, it's checking if the first character of each word in `words` matches its uppercase version). If the condition is true for an element, that element is included in the new list; otherwise, it is not.","status":200,"tokens":[0,159],"elapsed":1.249523858,"_type":"aimessage"}]
