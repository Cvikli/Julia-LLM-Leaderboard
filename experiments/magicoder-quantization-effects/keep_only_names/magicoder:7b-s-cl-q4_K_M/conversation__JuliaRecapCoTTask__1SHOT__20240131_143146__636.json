[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible solution to your problem:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    result = String[]\n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(word[1])\n            push!(result, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\nYou can call this function with a list of words as follows: \n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bear\", \"Elephant\", \"dog\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words) # prints: [\"Dog\", \"Bear\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\nThe `keep_only_names` function iterates over the input list of words. For each word, it checks if the first character is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function (which returns true for uppercase characters and false otherwise). If the first character is uppercase, it adds the word to the result array. Finally, it returns the result array.\n\nThis solution assumes that words are strings and that the input list of words is not empty. If you want to handle these cases, you could add error checking code before or after the loop in the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,274],"elapsed":2.234010132,"_type":"aimessage"}]
