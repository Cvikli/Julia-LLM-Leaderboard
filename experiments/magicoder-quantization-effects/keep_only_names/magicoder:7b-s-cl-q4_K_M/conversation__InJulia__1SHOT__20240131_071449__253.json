The `filter` function applies a condition (in this case, whether the first character of the word is a capital letter) and keeps only those elements that satisfy the condition. \n\nThe `uppercase(x[1])` part checks if the first character of the string is uppercase. If it is, then `filter` will keep the word; otherwise, it will discard it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,153],"elapsed":1.204335445,"_type":"aimessage"}]
