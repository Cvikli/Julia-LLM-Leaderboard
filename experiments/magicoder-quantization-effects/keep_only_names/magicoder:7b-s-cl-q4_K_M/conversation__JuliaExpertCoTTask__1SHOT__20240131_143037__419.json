If it is, it keeps that word; if not, it removes it from the list. The `uppercase(first(x))` part ensures that we're checking for uppercase letters at the start of words, even in cases where the original word might have been lowercase.\n\nYou can test this function using your provided data as follows:\n```julia\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])\n```\n\nThis will return `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`. As you can see, it has removed the words that do not start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,228],"elapsed":1.822036381,"_type":"aimessage"}]
