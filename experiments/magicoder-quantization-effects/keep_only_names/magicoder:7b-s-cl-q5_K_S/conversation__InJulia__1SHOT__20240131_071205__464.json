The `isuppercase` function checks if the first character of a string is uppercase, and `first` gets the first character of a string. If the condition `isuppercase(first(word))` returns true (meaning the word starts with an uppercase letter), then the word is kept in the list. Otherwise it's removed.","status":200,"tokens":[68,140],"elapsed":1.195122469,"_type":"aimessage"}]
