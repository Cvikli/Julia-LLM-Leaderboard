The `isupper` function checks whether the first character of the word is an uppercase letter, and the `first` function gets the first character of the string. If it's not an uppercase letter, the word won't be included in the output list.\n\nWhen we call this function with your sample data: \n```julia\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])\n```\nIt will return `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`, as these are the only words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,198],"elapsed":1.680001188,"_type":"aimessage"}]
