[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can define the `keep_only_names` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    result = String[]  # create an empty array to store the result\n    \n    for word in words  # iterate over each word in the provided list\n        if isuppercase(word[1])  # check if the first character of the word is uppercase\n            push!(result, word)  # if so, add it to the result array\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return result  # return the result array\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each word in the provided list. For each word, it checks whether the first character is uppercase (using `isuppercase(word[1])`). If it is, then the word is added to a new array (`result`), which is returned at the end of the function.\n\nNote: This code assumes that words are strings and uses Julia's built-in String methods for checking character case.","status":200,"tokens":[0,227],"elapsed":1.961315584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
