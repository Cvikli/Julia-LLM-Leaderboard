The expression `isupper(first(word))` checks whether the first character of each string (`word`) is uppercase (indicating it starts with a capital letter), and `[word for word in words if ...]` includes the string only if that condition is true.","status":200,"tokens":[0,135],"elapsed":1.15395391,"_type":"aimessage"}]
