In this case, the condition checks if the first character of the word (index 1) is equal to its uppercase version. Only those words that meet this condition are kept in the newWords variable.\n\nWhen you call `keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])`, it will return `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]` as these are the only names with a capital letter at the beginning.","status":200,"tokens":[0,183],"elapsed":1.589164364,"_type":"aimessage"}]
