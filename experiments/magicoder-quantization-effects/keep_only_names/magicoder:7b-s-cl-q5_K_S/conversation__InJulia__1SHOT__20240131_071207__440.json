The `uppercase` function is used to convert the first character of the string to uppercase, and if it's equal to itself after conversion (i.e., it was originally uppercase), then the word is kept.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Outputs: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,208],"elapsed":1.739910208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
