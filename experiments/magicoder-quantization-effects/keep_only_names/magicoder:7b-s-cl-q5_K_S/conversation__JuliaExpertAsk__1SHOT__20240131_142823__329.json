If the first character of a word (accessed using `word[1]`) is an uppercase letter (`isuppercase(word[1])`), it adds that word to the result array (`push!(result, word)`). The function then returns this result array.\n\nFor example, calling `keep_only_names([\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"elephant\"])` would return `[\"Cat\", \"Dog\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,180],"elapsed":1.518723498,"_type":"aimessage"}]
