If a word does start with an uppercase letter (determined by `isuppercase(word[1])`), it is added to the `result` array. The final `result` array, which contains only words that start with an uppercase letter, is then returned.","status":200,"tokens":[68,165],"elapsed":1.429959389,"_type":"aimessage"}]
