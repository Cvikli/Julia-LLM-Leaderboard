The `isuppercase` function returns `true` if the first character of the string is uppercase, and `false` otherwise. If the condition `word -> isuppercase(first(word))` is satisfied for a word, it remains in the filtered list; otherwise, it's removed.\n\nYou can call this function with a list of words as follows:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\", \"Elephant\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)\n```\nThis will print: `[\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Elephant\"]`\nThe function works with a generic type `T`, which allows it to work for any collection of strings. For example, you could use it on an array of symbols or characters as well.","status":200,"tokens":[0,269],"elapsed":2.308345138,"_type":"aimessage"}]
