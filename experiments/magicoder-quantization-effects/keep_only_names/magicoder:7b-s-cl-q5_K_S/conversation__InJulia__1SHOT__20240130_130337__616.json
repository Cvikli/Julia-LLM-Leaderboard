If the function returns `true`, the element is kept; if it returns `false`, the element is removed.\n\nThe anonymous function checks whether the first character of a word (obtained with `first(word)`) matches the uppercased version of itself (`uppercase(first(word))`). If they match, this means that the word starts with a capital letter and it's kept; otherwise, it's removed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,185],"elapsed":1.573162043,"_type":"aimessage"}]
