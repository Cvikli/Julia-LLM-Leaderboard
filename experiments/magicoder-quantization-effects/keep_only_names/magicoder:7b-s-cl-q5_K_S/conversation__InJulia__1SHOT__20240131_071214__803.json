The `uppercase` function is used to convert the first character of each word to its uppercase equivalent, and it checks if this is equal to the original first character (which should be a capital letter). If so, the word is kept; otherwise, it's removed from the final list.","status":200,"tokens":[0,130],"elapsed":1.084887842,"_type":"aimessage"}]
