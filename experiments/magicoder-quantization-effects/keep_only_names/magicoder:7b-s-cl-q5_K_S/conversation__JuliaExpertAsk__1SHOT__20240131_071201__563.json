The `isuppercase(first(word))` part checks if the first character of a word is an uppercase letter, and if it is, the word is kept. If not, it's removed from the result.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,182],"elapsed":1.526962418,"_type":"aimessage"}]
