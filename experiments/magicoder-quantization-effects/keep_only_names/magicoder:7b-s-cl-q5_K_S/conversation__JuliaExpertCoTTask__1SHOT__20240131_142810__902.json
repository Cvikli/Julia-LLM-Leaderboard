[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is your solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    new_list = []\n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(word[1]) # checks if the first character of a string is uppercase\n            push!(new_list, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return new_list\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `isuppercase` function to check whether the first letter in each word is an uppercase letter. If it is, the word is added to a new list (`new_list`). The function then returns this new list.\n\nYou can test your function with the provided data:\n\n```julia\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])\n```\n\nThis will return `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`, as these are the only words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,206],"elapsed":1.747336174,"_type":"aimessage"}]
