The `uppercase` function is used to convert the first character of each word to its uppercase equivalent, and then it checks if this is equal to the original first character (which would be a capital letter). If so, it keeps the word; otherwise, it removes it from the list.","status":200,"tokens":[0,128],"elapsed":1.069302011,"_type":"aimessage"}]
