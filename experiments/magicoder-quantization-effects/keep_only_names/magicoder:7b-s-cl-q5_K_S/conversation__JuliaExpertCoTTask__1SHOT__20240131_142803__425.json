Here's how you could solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return [word for word in words if isupper(first(word))]\nend\n```\nThis function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the `words` list and includes only those words that start with an uppercase letter. The `isupper(first(word))` part checks whether the first character of each word is uppercase.\n\nYou can test it out like this:\n\n```julia\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]))\n# Output: [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,158],"elapsed":1.341435799,"_type":"aimessage"}]
