The expression `word[0].isupper()` checks whether the first character of each word in the input list (`words`) is uppercase (i.e., it starts with a capital letter). Only those words that return `True` for this condition are included in the new list, which is then returned by the function.\n\nWhen you run this code with the given data, it will print: \n```python\n['Apple', 'Carrot']\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,176],"elapsed":1.513538237,"_type":"aimessage"}]
