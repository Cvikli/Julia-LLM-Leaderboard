The `filter` function applies a condition (`word -> word[1] == uppercase(word[1])`) to every element of the collection, and includes only those elements for which this condition is true.\n\nIn this case, the condition checks if the first character of the word (accessed by `word[1]`) is equal to its uppercase version (`uppercase(word[1])`). This will be true only for words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,176],"elapsed":1.479673474,"_type":"aimessage"}]
