The `isupper(first(word))` part checks whether the first character of the word is uppercase, effectively verifying that it starts with a capital letter. Words that pass this check are added to a new list, which is then returned as the result of the function.\n\nNow let's run your test on our solution:\n```julia\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]))\n```\nYou should get the output `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`, as it excludes all words that do not start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,204],"elapsed":1.57792667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
