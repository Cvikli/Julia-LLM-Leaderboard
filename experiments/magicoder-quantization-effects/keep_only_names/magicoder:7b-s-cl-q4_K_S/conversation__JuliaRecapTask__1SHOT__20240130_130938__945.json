[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple Julia function `keep_only_names` that accomplishes this:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Initialize an empty array to store the valid words\n    valid_words = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each word in the provided list\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the first character of the word is uppercase\n        if isupper(word[1])\n            # If it is, add the word to the array of valid words\n            push!(valid_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Return the array of valid words\n    return valid_words\nend\n```\nIn this function, we use a for loop to iterate over each `word` in the provided list. The `isupper(word[1])` statement checks whether the first character of `word` is uppercase. If it is, we add that word to our `valid_words` array using the `push!` function. Finally, we return the `valid_words` array containing all words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,242],"elapsed":1.911513751,"_type":"aimessage"}]
