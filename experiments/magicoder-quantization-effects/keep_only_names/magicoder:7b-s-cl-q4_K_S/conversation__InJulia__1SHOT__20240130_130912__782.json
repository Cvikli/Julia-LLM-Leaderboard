The `startswith` function is used to check if a word starts with a certain substring, in this case it checks if the first character of the word is an uppercase one by converting it using `uppercase`.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"bunny\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words)) # prints: String[\"Cat\", \"Dog\"]\n```\nThis will remove the words \"dog\" and \"bunny\" from the list as they do not start with a capital letter, but keep the words \"Cat\" and \"Dog\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,293],"elapsed":2.230542024,"_type":"aimessage"}]
