If it's lowercase then we use continue to skip that element, which means that the word will be ignored because it doesn't start with a capital letter as required.\n\nIf the first character is an uppercase letter then we add the word to the new_list (which holds only the words starting with a capital letter). We return this new list after processing all elements in provided list.","status":200,"tokens":[0,217],"elapsed":1.650414611,"_type":"aimessage"}]
