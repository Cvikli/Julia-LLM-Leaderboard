The `isupper` function checks if this character is uppercase, and the `!isempty(word)` check makes sure that we're not removing empty strings (which would happen if there are leading spaces in your list).\n\nYou can use it like this:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"bird\", \"\", \"Dog\"]\nnew_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprint(new_words)  # prints [\"Cat\",\"Dog\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[68,271],"elapsed":2.102271144,"_type":"aimessage"}]
