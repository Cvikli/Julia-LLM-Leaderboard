[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function to solve this problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Filter out words that don't start with an uppercase letter\n    filter(word -> word[1] == uppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `filter` function from Julia's standard library to iterate over all elements in the input list and only keeps those where the condition inside the filter function is true. In this case, that condition checks if the first character of each word is an uppercase letter. \n\nThe `uppercase(word[1])` function converts the first character of a string to uppercase for comparison with `word[1]`, ensuring that we only keep words which start with an uppercase letter.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"house\", \"Dog\", \"DOG\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # prints: [\"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"DOG\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,247],"elapsed":1.954526834,"_type":"aimessage"}]
