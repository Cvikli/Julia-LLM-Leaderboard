The condition inside the loop checks whether the first character of a word is an uppercase letter. If yes, it appends the word to a new list called `result`. In the end, the function returns the `result` list which contains only the words that start with capital letters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,152],"elapsed":1.159456595,"_type":"aimessage"}]
