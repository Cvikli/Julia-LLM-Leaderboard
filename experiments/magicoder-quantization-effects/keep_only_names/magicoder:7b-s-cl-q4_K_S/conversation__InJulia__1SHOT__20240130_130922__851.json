Here's how you could write this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    result = String[]\n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(word[1]) # checks if the first character of the string is an uppercase letter\n            push!(result, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\nThis function works by creating a new array `result` and then iterating over each element in the input list `words`. If the first character of any word (represented by `word[1]`) is an uppercase letter, it adds that word to `result`. Finally, it returns `result`, which contains only those words from the original list that started with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,181],"elapsed":1.383608459,"_type":"aimessage"}]
