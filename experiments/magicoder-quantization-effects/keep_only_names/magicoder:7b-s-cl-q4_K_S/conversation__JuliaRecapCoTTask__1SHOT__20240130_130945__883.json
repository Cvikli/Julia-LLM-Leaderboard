[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is one way to solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filter!(x -> startswith(x, uppercase(string(first(x)))), words)\nend\n```\nIn the above function `keep_only_names`, we use the built-in function `filter!` to only keep elements in the list that satisfy a condition. We use the anonymous function `(x -> ...)` to specify this condition: it checks whether the first character of each word is an uppercase letter by converting the whole string to its uppercase equivalent and checking if the first character matches it.\n\nThe `startswith` function checks if the given string starts with a certain substring, and `uppercase(string(first(x)))` converts the first character of the string to its uppercase equivalent. \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes your input is a list (an Array in Julia) of strings. If you provide something else as an argument or if the function does not work correctly, please provide more details about your specific situation so I can adjust my answer accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,238],"elapsed":1.884773227,"_type":"aimessage"}]
