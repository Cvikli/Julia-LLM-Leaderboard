Here's how you could define this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filter(x -> !islowercase(first(x)), words)\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `filter` function in Julia to return a new array consisting of only those elements from `words` that satisfy the condition provided by the anonymous (lambda) function. The `!` symbol is used to negate the result, so the filter will include only those strings where the first character is not lowercase.\n\nYou can then call this function with your list of words as follows:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\"]\nfiltered_names = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_names)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,214],"elapsed":2.384210608,"_type":"aimessage"}]
