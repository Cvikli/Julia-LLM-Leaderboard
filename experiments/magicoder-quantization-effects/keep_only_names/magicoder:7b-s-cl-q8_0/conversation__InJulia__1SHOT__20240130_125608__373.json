The predicate used in the `filter` function checks whether the first character (at index 1, since indexing starts from 1 in Julia) of a word is uppercase. If it's not, that means the word does not start with a capital letter and hence is filtered out.\n\nLet's test this function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"elephant\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words)) # prints [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,203],"elapsed":2.257430969,"_type":"aimessage"}]
