The `isuppercase` function returns true if its argument is an uppercase letter, and the `first(word)` gets the first character of each word. The filtered words are then returned as a new array.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"apple\", \"DOG\", \"dogCat\", \"123\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprint(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"DOG\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,209],"elapsed":2.332072271,"_type":"aimessage"}]
