In this case, we use a lambda function as the predicate to check if the first character of the word is uppercase. If it's not, the word is removed from the resulting list.\n\nYou can call the function like so:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\"]\nnew_list = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(new_list)  # Outputs: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,194],"elapsed":2.200151916,"_type":"aimessage"}]
