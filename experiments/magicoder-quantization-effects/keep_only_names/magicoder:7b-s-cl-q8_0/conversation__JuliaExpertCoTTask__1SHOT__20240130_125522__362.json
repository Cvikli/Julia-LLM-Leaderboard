Here's how you could write your function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filter(word -> startswith(word, uppercase(first(word))), words)\nend\n```\nThis function filters out all the words in `words` that do not start with a capital letter. The condition in the `filter` function is checked for each word in the list, if it returns true then the word gets included into the final result. \n\nFor example: \n\n```julia\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])\n```\nThe output will be `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`. \n\nThis is because only words starting with capital letters (\"Apple\" and \"Carrot\") are included in the final result.","status":200,"tokens":[231,202],"elapsed":4.713869984,"_type":"aimessage"}]
