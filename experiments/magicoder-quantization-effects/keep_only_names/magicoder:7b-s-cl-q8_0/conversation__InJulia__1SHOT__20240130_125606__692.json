In this case, we are using the `isuppercase` function from Julia's Standard Library, which checks if a character is uppercase.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Chicken\", \"dog\", \"Cat\"]\nfiltered_names = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_names)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Chicken\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,217],"elapsed":2.41842897,"_type":"aimessage"}]
