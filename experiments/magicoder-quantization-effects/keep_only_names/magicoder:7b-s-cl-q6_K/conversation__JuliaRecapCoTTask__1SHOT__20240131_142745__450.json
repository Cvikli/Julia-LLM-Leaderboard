[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple solution to your problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filtered_words = [] # Initialize an empty list to store the words that start with a capital letter.\n    for word in words # Iterate over each word in the input list.\n        if isuppercase(word[1]) # Check if the first character of the word is uppercase.\n            push!(filtered_words, word) # If it's an uppercase letter, add the word to the filtered_words list.\n        end\n    end\n    return filtered_words # Return the list of words that start with a capital letter.\nend\n```\nThis function `keep_only_names` takes in a list of words (`words`) as input and returns a new list which only contains the words that start with an uppercase letter. It does this by iterating over each word in the provided list, checking if the first character is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function, and if so, adding it to the `filtered_words` list. At the end of the function, it returns the `filtered_words` list.\n\nYou can call this function with a list of words like this:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"DOG\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words)) # Outputs: [\"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"DOG\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,324],"elapsed":3.172005968,"_type":"aimessage"}]
