The `isuppercase(first(word))` part checks if the first character of a word is upper case (i.e., it's a capital letter). If it is, then that word is included in the output. Otherwise, it is discarded.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"dog\", \"Cat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Outputs: [\"Dog\", \"Bird\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,200],"elapsed":1.903252963,"_type":"aimessage"}]
