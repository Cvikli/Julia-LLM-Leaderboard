[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can write this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Filter the words that start with an uppercase letter (this checks if the first character is an uppercase letter)\n    return filter(word -> isupper(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\nThis function uses Julia's built-in `filter` function to iterate over each word in the input list. The `isupper(first(word))` part checks if the first character of a string (i.e., the word) is an uppercase letter, and it returns true if so and false otherwise. If the result is true (which means the word starts with an uppercase letter), then that word stays in the list; if not, it gets removed from the list. \n\nYou can test this function like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"mouse\", \"Ant\", \"elephant\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words)) # It should print [\"Dog\",\"Ant\",\"elephant\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,241],"elapsed":2.405222784,"_type":"aimessage"}]
