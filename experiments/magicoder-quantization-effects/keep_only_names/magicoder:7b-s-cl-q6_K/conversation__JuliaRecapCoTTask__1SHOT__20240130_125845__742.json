[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple way to solve this task using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\nThis function uses the built-in `filter` method, which applies a condition to each element in an array and returns a new array containing only those elements that satisfy the condition. In this case, it checks if the first character of each word is uppercase (this will be true for words starting with a capital letter).\n\nThe `isuppercase(first(word))` part uses built-in functions to check if the first character of a string (word) is an uppercase letter. The `filter` function then applies this condition to every element in the input array, filtering out those elements that don't satisfy the condition.\n\nPlease replace `\"{{instructions}}\"` with your specific instructions.","status":200,"tokens":[0,197],"elapsed":1.959869737,"_type":"aimessage"}]
