The anonymous function checks whether the first character of each word (`word -> islowercase(first(word))`) is lowercase using the built-in `islowercase` function. If it is, the word is included in the new list; otherwise, it's not.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\", \"dog\", \"DOG\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words) # prints: [\"Dog\", \"DOG\"]\n```\nIn the example above, only words that start with a capital letter are included in `filtered_words`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,239],"elapsed":2.274394548,"_type":"aimessage"}]
