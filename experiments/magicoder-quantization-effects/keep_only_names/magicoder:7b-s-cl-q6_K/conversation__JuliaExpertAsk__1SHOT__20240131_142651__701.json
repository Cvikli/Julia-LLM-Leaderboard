If it does start with a capital letter, it adds that word to the `result` array. Finally, it returns the `result` array which contains only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nHere's how you can call this function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,206],"elapsed":1.965543813,"_type":"aimessage"}]
