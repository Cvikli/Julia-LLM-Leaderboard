[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example solution written in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Initialize a new list to store the words that start with a capital letter\n    result = []\n    \n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(word[1])\n            push!(result, word)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Ball\", \"House\", \"dog\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Ball\", \"House\"]\n```\n\nIn the code above, we are looping over each word in the input list. We check if the first character of the current word is uppercase using `isuppercase`. If it is, we push that word to our result array. The function then returns this result array.","status":200,"tokens":[0,215],"elapsed":2.098059233,"_type":"aimessage"}]
