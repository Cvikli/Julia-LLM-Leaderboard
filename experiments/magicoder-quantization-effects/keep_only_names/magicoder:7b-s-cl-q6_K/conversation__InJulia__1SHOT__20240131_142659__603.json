The condition is defined as a function passed to `filter!`, in this case `x -> first(x) == uppercase(first(x))`. This function checks if the first character of each word (`x`) is the same as its upper-case version, which would be true only for words that start with an uppercase letter.\n\nYou can use it like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\", \"dog\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Outputs: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,227],"elapsed":2.160496639,"_type":"aimessage"}]
