[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can define this function in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    return [word for word in words if isupper(first(word))]\nend\n```\nIn the above code, we use a list comprehension to filter out the words that don't start with a capital letter. The `isupper` function checks whether the first character of a string is an uppercase letter or not and the `first` function returns the first character of the string.\n\nIf you want to strictly follow your instructions, you can modify this code to be case-insensitive:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    return [word for word in words if isupper(first(lowercase(word)))]\nend\n```\nIn the above code, we convert every word to lowercase before checking if it starts with a capital letter. This means that the function will keep words like \"Dog\" and remove words like \"dog\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,226],"elapsed":2.236070378,"_type":"aimessage"}]
