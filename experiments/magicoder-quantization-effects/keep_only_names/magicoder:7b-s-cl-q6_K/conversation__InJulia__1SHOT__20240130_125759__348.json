It checks whether the first letter (the only one we care about for this problem) of each word is uppercase using the built-in `isuppercase` function. If it's true, that means the word starts with a capital letter, and therefore it's added to the result array (`result`). In the end, all words that start with an uppercase letter are returned as a list (an array in Julia).","status":200,"tokens":[0,200],"elapsed":1.910539189,"_type":"aimessage"}]
