The `uppercase` function is used to convert the first character of each word to its uppercase equivalent, and then it checks if this is equal to the original first character (which will only be true for words that start with a capital letter). If the condition is met, the word is included in the output list.","status":200,"tokens":[0,137],"elapsed":1.297282274,"_type":"aimessage"}]
