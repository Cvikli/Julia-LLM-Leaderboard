[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can achieve this by using the `startswith` function in Julia. This function checks if a string starts with the specified prefix, and returns true if it does. Here is how you could implement your function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    result = String[] # create an empty array of strings to store our results\n    for word in words # iterate over each word in the input list\n        if startswith(word, uppercase(first(word))) # check if the first character is uppercase\n            push!(result, word) # if it is, add it to our result\n        end\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\nIn this function, we iterate over each word in the `words` list. For each word, we use the `startswith` function to check whether the word starts with a capital letter. If it does, we append the word to our result array. Finally, we return the result array which contains only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nIf any special instructions are provided they can be implemented here according to the instruction.","status":200,"tokens":[0,238],"elapsed":2.364772442,"_type":"aimessage"}]
