[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this task by using Julia's built-in functions. Here is an example of how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    # Filter function to check if a word starts with a capital letter\n    filter_func = x -> occursin(r\"^[A-Z]\", x)\n    \n    # Use filter from the standard library to get words that start with a capital letter.\n    result = filter(filter_func, words)\n    \n    return collect(result)  # Convert the filtered result back into an Array.\nend\n```\nThis function iterates over each word in `words`, checks if it starts with a capital letter using the `occursin` function, which checks for pattern matches and returns true if found else false, and then uses that to filter out any words from the original array that do not start with a capital letter. The `collect` function is used to convert the filtered result back into an Array before returning it. \n\nThe function `keep_only_names` takes in a Vector of Strings as its argument, filters this list using the defined filter function and returns the filtered list after converting it back into an Array.","status":200,"tokens":[0,269],"elapsed":2.682269924,"_type":"aimessage"}]
