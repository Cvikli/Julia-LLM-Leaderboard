For each word, we check whether the first letter (at index 0 in Julia as it starts from 1 like Python) is uppercase using `isuppercase(word[1])` which returns true if the character at given index is an uppercase and false otherwise. If it's true, then we push that word to our result array. At the end of iteration over all words, we return this list which contains only those words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,186],"elapsed":1.751646435,"_type":"aimessage"}]
