The `uppercase` function is used to convert the first character of each word to upper case, and then it checks if it's equal to the original letter (which will be upper-case). If this condition holds true for any word in the list, it is kept, otherwise, it gets removed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,163],"elapsed":1.563028277,"_type":"aimessage"}]
