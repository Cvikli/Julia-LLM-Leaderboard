For each `word`, it checks whether its first character (`word[1]`) is a lowercase letter using the built-in `islowercase()` function. If it's not, it means that the word starts with a capital letter and so we add it to the result array. Finally, the function returns this result array.\n\nYou can test this function by calling it with an array of words:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words)) # Outputs: String[\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,224],"elapsed":2.155440262,"_type":"aimessage"}]
