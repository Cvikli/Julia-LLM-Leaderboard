In this case, we apply the condition that first character of the string should be uppercase. \n\nYou can use it like this:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))\n```\nIt will output `[\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,171],"elapsed":1.64435855,"_type":"aimessage"}]
