For each word, it checks whether the first character (at index 0 in Julia as it is 1-based) is uppercase using the built-in `isuppercase` function. If it is, the word is added to the result array. Finally, the result array is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[68,157],"elapsed":1.507482156,"_type":"aimessage"}]
