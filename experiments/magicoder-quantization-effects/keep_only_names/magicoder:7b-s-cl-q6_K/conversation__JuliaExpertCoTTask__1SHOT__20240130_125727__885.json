The condition inside the filter is checking if the first character of a word (`x[1]`) is a capital letter (in the range from A to Z). If it's not, the element gets removed from the array (`filter!`).\n\nTesting this with given data:\n```julia\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])\n```\nThis would return `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,251],"elapsed":2.433772569,"_type":"aimessage"}]
