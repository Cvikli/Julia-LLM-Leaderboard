Here's how you might write such a function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filter(word -> islowercase(first(word)) && !isempty(word), words)\nend\n```\nIn this code, `filter` is a higher-order function that applies a condition to each element of an iterable and returns those elements where the condition holds. In our case, we're filtering out words that are not all lowercase and have at least one character (so they're not empty). The `islowercase(first(word))` part checks if the first character of a word is in lowercase (indicating it doesn't start with a capital letter), while `!isempty(word)` checks if the string has any characters (i.e., it's not an empty string).","status":200,"tokens":[0,188],"elapsed":1.820450975,"_type":"aimessage"}]
