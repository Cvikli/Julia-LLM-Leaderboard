The condition is met if the word `x` starts with an uppercase letter (`uppercase(first(x))`), where `first(x)` returns the first character of `x`.\n\nLet's test this function using your example:\n\n```julia\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]))  # Output: [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\nAs you can see, the function correctly removes \"banana\" and \"dog\" from your list.","status":200,"tokens":[0,219],"elapsed":1.762290429,"_type":"aimessage"}]
