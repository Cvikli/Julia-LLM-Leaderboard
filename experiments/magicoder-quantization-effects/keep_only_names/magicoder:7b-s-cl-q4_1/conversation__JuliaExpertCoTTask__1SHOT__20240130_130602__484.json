The `isuppercase(first(word))` part checks if the first character of a word is upper case. The `first(word)` function gets the first character of a word and the `isuppercase` function checks whether it's an upper case or not.\n\nLet's test this function with your provided data:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))  # Output: [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\nThe output is as expected, it only includes the words that start with an uppercase letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,211],"elapsed":1.735931778,"_type":"aimessage"}]
