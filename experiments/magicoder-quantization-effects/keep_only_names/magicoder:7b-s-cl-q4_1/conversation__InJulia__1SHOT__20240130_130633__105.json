If the first character of the word is not uppercase (which means it's a lowercase letter), and the length of the word is greater than 1 (i.e., there are more than one characters), then the word is added to the new list.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))  # Outputs: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,231],"elapsed":1.84669265,"_type":"aimessage"}]
