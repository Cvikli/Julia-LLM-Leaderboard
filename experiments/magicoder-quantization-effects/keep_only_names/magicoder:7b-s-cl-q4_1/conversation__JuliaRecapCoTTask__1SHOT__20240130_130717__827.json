[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here is how you can define this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words) \n    result = String[] \n    \n    for word in words \n        if first(word) == uppercase(first(word)) && !isempty(word)   #checking if the word starts with a capital letter\n            push!(result, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nYou can call this function by passing in your list of words:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"bird\", \"Cat\", \"Doggy\"] \nprint(keep_only_names(words))\n```\nThis will return `[\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Doggy\"]`.\n\nPlease note that the function does not check whether a word contains any other characters after the first one, as per your requirement. If you want to ensure words start with exactly one capital letter (not just a series of them), replace `first(word)` in the `if` statement with `uppercase(first(word))`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,246],"elapsed":2.016016119,"_type":"aimessage"}]
