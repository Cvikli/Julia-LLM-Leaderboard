[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function `keep_only_names` that follows the problem statement:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    new_list = []\n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(word[1])\n            push!(new_list, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return new_list\nend\n``` \nThis function iterates over the list of words. For each word, it checks if the first character (at index 0) of the string is a capital letter using `isuppercase`. If this condition is met, it pushes that word into the newly created list (`new_list`). It then returns this new list which consists of words that start with a capital.\n  \nThe function handles special instructions as follows:\n- If any capital letter is needed to be considered in the function, you can modify `isuppercase(word[1])` to `isspace(word[2]) || isletter(word[1])`. This will ensure that words like \"Dog\" and \"dog\" are included. \n- If a special character should be used instead of space (` `), replace `isspace(word[2])` with the function that checks for this special character, e.g., `islowercase(word[1])`.\n  \nPlease note, in Julia indexing starts from 1, not 0. So in case of string like \"Dog\", 2nd index is 'o' which is a lowercase letter by default in Julia. This is why the function checks for space (or special character) at index 1.","status":200,"tokens":[0,351],"elapsed":2.941134233,"_type":"aimessage"}]
