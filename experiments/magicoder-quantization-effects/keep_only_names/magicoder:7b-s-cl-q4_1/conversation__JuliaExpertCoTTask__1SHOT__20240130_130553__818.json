For each word, it checks if the first letter is uppercase (using `isuppercase`) and not a number (using `!isnumeric`). If both conditions are true, it adds that word to the new list (`new_list`). Finally, it returns this new list.\n\nYou can test this function with your sample data:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))  # Outputs: [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[231,225],"elapsed":3.321693117,"_type":"aimessage"}]
