Here's an example of how you could solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    new_list = String[]  # create a new list to store the words that start with uppercase letters\n    for word in words\n        if ismatch(r\"^[A-Z]\", word)\n            push!(new_list, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return new_list\nend\n```\nIn this function, `ismatch` checks each word to see if it starts with a capital letter by using the regular expression pattern '^[A-Z]'. If so, it gets added to the new list. \n\nYou can call this function with your list of words as follows:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"car\", \"house\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)\n```\nThis will print `[\"Dog\", \"Bird\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,233],"elapsed":1.884412573,"_type":"aimessage"}]
