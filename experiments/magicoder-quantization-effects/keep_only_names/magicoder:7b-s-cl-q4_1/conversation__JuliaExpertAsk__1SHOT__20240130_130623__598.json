If it's uppercase then that word will be kept and if not, it will be removed from the list. \n\nYou can call this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))\n```\n\nOutput: `[\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]`","status":200,"tokens":[0,167],"elapsed":1.322970259,"_type":"aimessage"}]
