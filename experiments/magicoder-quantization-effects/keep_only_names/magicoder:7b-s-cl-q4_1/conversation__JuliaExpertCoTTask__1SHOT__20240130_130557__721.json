We pass it our input string and the capitalized version of its first character (achieved by calling `uppercase(first(s))` on it). \n\nThen we use the `filter` function to only keep words that start with a capital letter. The `filter` function applies the given function to each element in the collection and returns a new collection with elements from the original collection where the function was true.\n\nThe `startswith(s, uppercase(first(s)))` means it checks whether the first character of every word is a capital letter. If it's not a capitalized letter, then remove that element.","status":200,"tokens":[0,196],"elapsed":1.575421908,"_type":"aimessage"}]
