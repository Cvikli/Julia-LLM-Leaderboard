In this case, the provided function checks whether the first character of each word is a capital letter by comparing it with its uppercase version. If they are equal, then the word is kept in the resulting list; otherwise, it's removed.\n\nYou can use it like so:\n```julia\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]))\n```\nThis will output `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,191],"elapsed":1.684800168,"_type":"aimessage"}]
