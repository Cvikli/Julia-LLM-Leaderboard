If it is, we add it to our results array (`result`). At the end of this loop, we have an array containing only words that start with a capital letter.\n\nFor example: \n```julia\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])\n```\nThis would return `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,161],"elapsed":1.421543388,"_type":"aimessage"}]
