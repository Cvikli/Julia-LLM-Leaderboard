The anonymous function checks whether the first character of each word (`x`) is the same as its uppercase version. If it is, the function returns true; if not, false. Thus, this filters out all words that do not start with a capital letter.\n\nLet's test our function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```\nAs you can see, \"dog\" and \"cat\" have been removed because they do not start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,213],"elapsed":1.89248427,"_type":"aimessage"}]
