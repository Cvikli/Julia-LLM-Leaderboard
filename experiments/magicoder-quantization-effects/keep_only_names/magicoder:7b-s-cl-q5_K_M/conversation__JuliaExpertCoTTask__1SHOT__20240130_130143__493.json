For each word, it checks whether the first character of the word (`isupper(first(word))`) is an uppercase letter using the `isupper` built-in function of Julia which returns `true` if a character is upper case and `false` otherwise. \n\nIf this check passes (i.e., the first character of the word is uppercase), it adds that word to the new list which is then returned by the function.\n\nNow let's test our function with the provided data:\n```julia\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])\n```\nIt will output `[:Apple, :Carrot]`, which are the words that start with an uppercase letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,232],"elapsed":2.047276796,"_type":"aimessage"}]
