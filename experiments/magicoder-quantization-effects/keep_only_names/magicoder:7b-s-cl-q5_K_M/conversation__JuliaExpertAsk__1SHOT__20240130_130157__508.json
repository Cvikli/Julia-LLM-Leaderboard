It returns a new array which contains only those elements for which the function is true. The second argument `uppercase(x[1])` checks if the first letter of the word is upper-case.\n\nYou can call this function with your list of words like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"elephant\", \"Elephant\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words) # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"Elephant\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[98,210],"elapsed":1.866322418,"_type":"aimessage"}]
