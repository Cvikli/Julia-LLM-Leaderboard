Then it iterates over each word in the input list. If a word starts with a capital letter (`uppercase(word[1]) == true`), and is not an empty string, it gets added to the result. Finally, it returns this new list of words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,160],"elapsed":1.398081881,"_type":"aimessage"}]
