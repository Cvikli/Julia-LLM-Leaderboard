For each word, it checks whether the first character is uppercase using `isupper` function (in Julia). If it's true, that means the word starts with a capital letter and it gets added to a new list via `push!`. The final result is returned as output of the function.\n\nTo use this function:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nprint(keep_only_names(words))\n```\nThis will return:\n`[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`","status":200,"tokens":[0,205],"elapsed":1.806387694,"_type":"aimessage"}]
