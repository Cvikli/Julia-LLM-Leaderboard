Here is a simple solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(x -> x[1] == uppercase(x[1]), words)\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `filter` function to create a new array that only includes the words that start with a capital letter. The condition inside `filter` checks if the first character of each word is a capital letter by comparing it to its uppercase version (`uppercase(x[1])`). If it's not a capital, the word will be removed from the result list.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bear\", \"mouse\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Outputs: [\"Dog\",\"Bear\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,199],"elapsed":1.735073109,"_type":"aimessage"}]
