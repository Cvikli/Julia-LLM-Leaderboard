[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is a function `keep_only_names` written in Julia which fulfills your requirements:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words) \n    result = String[]\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the first letter of word is uppercase.\n        if isupper(word[1])\n            push!(result, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\nIn this function, we iterate over each word in the input array `words`. For each word, we check if the first character (indexed by `1`) is uppercase using the built-in `isupper` function. If it's true that the first letter of the word is uppercase, then we add this word to our result list. \n\nFinally, we return the result list which contains only those words from `words` that start with an uppercase letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,201],"elapsed":1.793086684,"_type":"aimessage"}]
