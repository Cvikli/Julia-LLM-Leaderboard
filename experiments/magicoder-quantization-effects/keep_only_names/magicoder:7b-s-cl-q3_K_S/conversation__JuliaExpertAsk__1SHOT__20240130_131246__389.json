We create another empty array (`new_list`), iterate over each word in the input list and if the first letter is capitalized (which we check using `uppercase(word[1])`), add it to `new_list`. Finally, we return `new_list` which contains only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,211],"elapsed":1.656056654,"_type":"aimessage"}]
