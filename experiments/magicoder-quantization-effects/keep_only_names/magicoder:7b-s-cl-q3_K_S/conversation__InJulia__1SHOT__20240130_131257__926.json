If the first character of a word (obtained using indexing: `word[1]`) is not lowercase (`islowercase(word[1]) == false`), we add it to our `filtered_words` list.\n\nFinally, we return this list which contains only the words that start with capitals.","status":200,"tokens":[0,180],"elapsed":1.406660827,"_type":"aimessage"}]
