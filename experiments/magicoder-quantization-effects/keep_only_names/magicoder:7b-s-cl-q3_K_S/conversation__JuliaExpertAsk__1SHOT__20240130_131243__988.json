We use this function on our list of words, effectively removing words that don't start with an uppercase letter.\n\nTo test the function, you can run: \n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cats\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))\n```\n\nThis would return `[\"Dog\", \"Cats\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,182],"elapsed":1.452168404,"_type":"aimessage"}]
