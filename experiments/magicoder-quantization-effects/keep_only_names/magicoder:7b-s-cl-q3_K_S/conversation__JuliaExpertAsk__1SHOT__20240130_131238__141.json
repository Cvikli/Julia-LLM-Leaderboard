If a word is not empty and its first character (after conversion to uppercase via `uppercase(first(word))`) matches that after converting it to uppercase, then the word is added to the `filtered_words` array. At the end, `filtered_words` contains only words starting with a capital letter.\n  \nHere's how you could use this function:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\", \"\", \"apple\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: String[\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[98,254],"elapsed":2.057458173,"_type":"aimessage"}]
