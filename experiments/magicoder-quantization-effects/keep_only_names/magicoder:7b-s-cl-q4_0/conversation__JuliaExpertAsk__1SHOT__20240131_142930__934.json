The `islowercase` function checks if the first character of a string (`w[1]`) is lowercase. If it is, that means the word starts with a lowercase letter and the word is kept. Otherwise, it's removed from the output.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"doggy\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # prints: [\"Dog\", \"Bird\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,196],"elapsed":1.472891728,"_type":"aimessage"}]
