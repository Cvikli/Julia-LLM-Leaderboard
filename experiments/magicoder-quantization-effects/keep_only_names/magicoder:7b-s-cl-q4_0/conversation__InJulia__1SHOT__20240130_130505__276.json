Here is an example function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filter(x -> startswith(x, uppercase(first(x))), words)\nend\n```\n\nThis `keep_only_names` function uses the built-in `filter` function and `startswith` function to iterate over each word in the input list. It keeps a word if it begins with a capital letter (as determined by `uppercase(first(x))`). \n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Duck\", \"dog\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln.(filtered_words)\n```\n\nThis will output: `[\"Dog\", \"Duck\"]` because \"Dog\" and \"Duck\" start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,219],"elapsed":1.632268037,"_type":"aimessage"}]
