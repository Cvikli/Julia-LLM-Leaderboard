[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple way to solve this task in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Array{String,1})\n    # filter function that checks if the first letter of each word is uppercase\n    is_capital = map(first, words) do c\n        isupper(c)\n    end\n\n    # filter out all words that start with a capital letter\n    result = filter(words) do w\n        any(is_capital) do i\n            first(w) == i\n        end\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses Julia's built-in `filter` method to iterate over the words in the input array and keep only those that start with a capital letter. The `map` method is used to check whether each first character of the words (using `first(word)`) is uppercase. \n\nHere's how you could use this function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words) # Output: String[\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,269],"elapsed":2.083266616,"_type":"aimessage"}]
