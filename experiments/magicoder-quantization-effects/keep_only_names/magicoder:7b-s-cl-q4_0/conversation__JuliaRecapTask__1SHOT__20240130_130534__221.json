[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function `keep_only_names` which keeps only the names starting with a capital letter:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Initialize an empty list to store valid names\n    valid_names = []\n    \n    # Iterate over all words\n    for word in words\n        if isuppercasefirst(word[1]) && length(word) > 1 # Checks if the name starts with a capital letter\n            push!(valid_names, word) # Add this valid name to the list\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return valid_names # Return the list of names that start with a capital letter\nend\n```\nIn this function, `isuppercasefirst` is used to check if the first character of a string is upper case. We use it as a simple check to see whether the word starts with a capital letter or not. \n\nNote: In Julia, the convention is that variables are lowercase by default. If we need to define a constant or variable with a specific name (like 'ValidNames'), we can use the `@const` keyword to explicitly declare it as constant.\n```julia\n@const ValidNames = keep_only_names(words) # This will be the list of names that start with a capital letter\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,286],"elapsed":2.219359418,"_type":"aimessage"}]
