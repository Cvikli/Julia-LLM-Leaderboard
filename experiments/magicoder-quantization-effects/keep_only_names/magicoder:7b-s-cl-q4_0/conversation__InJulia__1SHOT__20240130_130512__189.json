This way, we get an array with only the words that start with a capital letter. Note that I also included a condition to check if the length of each word is more than 0 to handle possible empty strings.\n\nYou can test this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"\", \"Doggo\", \"dOg\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words)) # Outputs: String[\"Cat\", \"Doggo\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,268],"elapsed":2.009119725,"_type":"aimessage"}]
