The `isuppercase` function checks if the first character of an element (`x`) is uppercase or not, and `first(x)` gives the first character of the string `x`.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words) # Outputs: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,184],"elapsed":1.38300115,"_type":"aimessage"}]
