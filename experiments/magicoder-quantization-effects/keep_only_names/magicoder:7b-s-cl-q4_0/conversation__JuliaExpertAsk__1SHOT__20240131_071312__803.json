The condition `x -> first(x) == uppercase(first(x))` checks if the first character of each word is equal to its uppercase version, which means it's a capital letter.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bear\", \"elephant\", \"doggy\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Outputs: [\"Dog\", \"Bear\", \"doggy\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,197],"elapsed":1.463921115,"_type":"aimessage"}]
