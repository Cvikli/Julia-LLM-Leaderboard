If it is, the word is included in the new list; otherwise, it is ignored.\n\nYou can call this function like so:\n```python\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\"]\nprint(keep_only_names(words))  # Outputs: ['Dog', 'Cat']\n```","status":200,"tokens":[98,171],"elapsed":1.298477475,"_type":"aimessage"}]
