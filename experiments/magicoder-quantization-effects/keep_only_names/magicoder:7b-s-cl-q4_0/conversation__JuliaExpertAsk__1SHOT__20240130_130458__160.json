If the predicate returns `true`, then that element is kept in the output; otherwise, it's discarded. In other words, this function filters out all words that do not start with a capital letter.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"Elephant\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # prints: [\"Dog\", \"Bird\", \"Elephant\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,210],"elapsed":1.582423055,"_type":"aimessage"}]
