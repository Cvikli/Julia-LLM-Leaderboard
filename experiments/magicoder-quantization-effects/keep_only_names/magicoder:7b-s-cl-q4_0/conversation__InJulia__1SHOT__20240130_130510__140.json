Here is how you can define such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    filter(word -> !isempty(word) && startswith(uppercase(word), 'D'), words)\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `filter` function to apply a condition for each word in the list. The condition checks if the word is not empty and starts with an uppercase letter ('D' here). If both conditions are true, then the word is kept; otherwise, it is removed from the list.","status":200,"tokens":[0,155],"elapsed":1.159062412,"_type":"aimessage"}]
