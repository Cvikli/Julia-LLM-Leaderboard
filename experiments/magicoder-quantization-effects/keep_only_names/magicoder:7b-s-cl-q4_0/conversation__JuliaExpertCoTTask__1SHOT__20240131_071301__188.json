The `uppercase` function is used to convert the first character of each word to uppercase, and then it checks if this is equal to the original first character (which will be uppercase). If they are equal, the word is kept; otherwise, it is removed from the array.\n\nWhen you run this code with the provided data, it returns `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`, as these are the only words that start with a capital letter in the input list.","status":200,"tokens":[0,201],"elapsed":1.509251925,"_type":"aimessage"}]
