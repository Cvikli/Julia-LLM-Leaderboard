The condition in the filter is `x -> x[1] == uppercase(x[1])`, which checks if the first character of each word is a capital letter. If it's not, the element is removed from the list.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"dog\", \"Cat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,204],"elapsed":1.519990123,"_type":"aimessage"}]
