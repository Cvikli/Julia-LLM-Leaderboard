This anonymous function checks if the first character of each word is lowercase (`islowercase(first(w))`) and if it's also not uppercase (`!isuppercase(first(w))`); this will be true for words that start with a capital letter but are not all-caps.\n\nYou can call this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)\n```\nThis will output `[\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,226],"elapsed":1.69495815,"_type":"aimessage"}]
