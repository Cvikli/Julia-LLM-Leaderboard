Here is an example:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words) \n    return [word for word in words if islowercase(word[1]) && !ispunct(word[1])]\nend\n```\nThis function uses `islowercase` to check if the first character of a word is a lowercase letter (hence indicating it starts with a capital) and `ispunct` to check if the first character is not a punctuation. If both conditions are true, it includes that word in the return list; otherwise, it excludes it.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"fish\", \"Dog2\", \":)\", \".\", \",\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words) # Outputs: [\"Cat\", \"Dog2\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, only the words \"Cat\" and \"Dog2\" are included in the result since they start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,263],"elapsed":1.989766178,"_type":"aimessage"}]
