The anonymous function checks whether the first character of each word (`x`) is an uppercase letter by using the `isuppercase` function on `first(x)`. If it's true, then the function returns `true`, meaning the word will be included in the new array.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Prints: [\"Dog\",\"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[98,205],"elapsed":1.585069517,"_type":"aimessage"}]
