Here is how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return [word for word in words if startswith(word, ucfirst(word[1]))]\nend\n```\n\nIn the above function, `ucfirst` function is used to convert the first character of a string to uppercase. This function will return true only if the first letter is an uppercase letter. The list comprehension loops over each word in the provided list and includes it in the new list if it starts with an uppercase letter.\n\nYou can test this function using your data:\n\n```julia\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])\n```\n\nThis will return `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]` as output, since only words starting with an uppercase letter are included.","status":200,"tokens":[0,222],"elapsed":1.682284113,"_type":"aimessage"}]
