The `isuppercase(first(x))` part checks if the first character of each word (`x`) is an uppercase letter.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Prints: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,174],"elapsed":1.307844087,"_type":"aimessage"}]
