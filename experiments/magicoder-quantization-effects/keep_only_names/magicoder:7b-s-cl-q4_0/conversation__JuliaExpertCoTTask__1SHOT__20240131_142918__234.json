[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

For each word, it checks if the first character is uppercase (using the `isuppercase` function). If it is, the word is added to a result array. Finally, the result array is returned as the output of the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,213],"elapsed":1.610319165,"_type":"aimessage"}]
