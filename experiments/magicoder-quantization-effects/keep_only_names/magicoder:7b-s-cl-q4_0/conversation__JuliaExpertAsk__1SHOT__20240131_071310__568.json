If it is, that word remains in the list; otherwise, it's removed. The `uppercase` function is used to ensure that we are comparing with an uppercase version of the first character.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)\n```\nThis will output `[\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Elephant\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,205],"elapsed":1.522992638,"_type":"aimessage"}]
