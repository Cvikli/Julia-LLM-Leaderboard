The `isuppercase(first(x))` part checks if the first character of a word (which we assume is the only one that matters for this problem, since it's not specified whether to check all characters or just the first) is an uppercase letter. If it is, the word is kept in the result; otherwise, it's removed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,140],"elapsed":1.033938305,"_type":"aimessage"}]
