The condition `isuppercase(first(word))` checks if the first character of a word is uppercase (which indicates that it starts with a capital letter). If the condition is true, then the word is kept; otherwise, it is removed from the resulting list.","status":200,"tokens":[0,121],"elapsed":2.076520286,"_type":"aimessage"}]
