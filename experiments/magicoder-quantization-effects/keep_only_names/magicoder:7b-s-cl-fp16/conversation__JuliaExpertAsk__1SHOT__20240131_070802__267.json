If it is, that word is kept; otherwise, it's removed from the list. The `uppercase(x[1])` part ensures that we are comparing against an uppercase version of the first character, regardless of whether it was originally lowercase or uppercase.","status":200,"tokens":[0,142],"elapsed":2.441642976,"_type":"aimessage"}]
