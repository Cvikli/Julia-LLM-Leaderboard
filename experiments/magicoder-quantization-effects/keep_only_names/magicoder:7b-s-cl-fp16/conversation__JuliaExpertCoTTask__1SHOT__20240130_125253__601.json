If the condition is true for an element, then that element remains in the list. If not, it gets removed from the list. In our case, the condition checks if the first character of a word (`first(word)`) is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function. The `->` operator is used to define anonymous function (a function defined without a name).\n\nThe call `keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])` will return: `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,198],"elapsed":3.456901269,"_type":"aimessage"}]
