The `isuppercase(first(word))` part checks if the first character of the word (which is assumed to be a string) is an uppercase letter. If it's not, that word will be removed from the output.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"dog\", \"Cat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words) # Outputs: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[68,192],"elapsed":3.303807365,"_type":"aimessage"}]
