[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function that performs this task:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\nThe `filter` function creates a new array with elements of the original array for which the provided function returns `true`. The `isuppercase(first(word))` checks if the first character (index 1, because Julia indexing starts from 1) is uppercase. If it's not an error will be thrown. So, this function will keep only words that start with a capital letter.\n\nHowever, please note that in Julia indexing starts from 1 and `first(word)` gives the first character of the word. In some other languages, like Python, indexing starts from 0 and you would need to use `word[0]` to get the first character.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that this function will throw an error if it encounters a word with no characters (like an empty string), as `first(word)` will return an error for an empty string. If you want to handle such cases, you might need to add some extra checks or use try-catch blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[11,257],"elapsed":4.544596899,"_type":"aimessage"}]
