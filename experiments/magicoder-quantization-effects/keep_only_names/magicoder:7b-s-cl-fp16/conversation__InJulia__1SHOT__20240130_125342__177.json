If it is, then we push the word into the `result` array. Finally, we return this array that contains only words starting with a capital letter. \n\nNote: In Julia indexing starts from 1 (not from 0 like in some other languages). Also, the function `isuppercase()` checks whether the first character of the string is an uppercase letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,238],"elapsed":4.170359149,"_type":"aimessage"}]
