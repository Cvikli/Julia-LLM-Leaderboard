It checks whether the first character (at index 1, since indexing in Julia starts at 1) of each word is equal to its uppercase version. If it is, that means the word starts with a capital letter and it's kept; if not, it's removed from the list.","status":200,"tokens":[0,140],"elapsed":2.413384493,"_type":"aimessage"}]
