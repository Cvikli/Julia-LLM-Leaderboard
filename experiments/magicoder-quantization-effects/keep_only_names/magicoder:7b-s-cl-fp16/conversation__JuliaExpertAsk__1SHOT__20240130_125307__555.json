The `isuppercase(first(word))` checks if the first character of a word is an uppercase letter. If it is, then the word stays in the resulting filtered list. Otherwise, it gets removed.\n\nHere's how you would use this function:\n```julia\nnames = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"elephant\"]\nfiltered_names = keep_only_names(names)\nprintln(filtered_names) # Prints: [\"Dog\",\"Elephant\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,194],"elapsed":3.379386512,"_type":"aimessage"}]
