The `isuppercase` function checks if the first character of a string (which represents the first letter of the word) is an uppercase letter, and the `first` function gets the first character of the string. If the condition (`isuppercase(first(word))`) is true for a word, that word will be included in the result.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"bird\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Outputs: [\"Cat\", \"Dog\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,208],"elapsed":3.565335445,"_type":"aimessage"}]
