Then you use an if statement to check if the first character of the word is uppercase. If it's not, you add that word to a new list (which will exclude words that start with lowercase letters). Here's how you can do this:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # initialize an empty array for the output\n    output = []\n    \n    # iterate over each word in the input list\n    for word in words\n        if isuppercasefirstletter(word)  # check if first letter is uppercase\n            push!(output, word)  # add to output if true\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return output\nend\n```\n\nThis function `keep_only_names` will take a list of words (`words`) as input and return a new list that only includes the words that start with an uppercase letter. The helper function `isuppercasefirstletter(word)` checks if the first character of a word is uppercase:\n\n```julia\nfunction isuppercasefirstletter(word)\n    return isuppercase(word[1])  # check if first char of string is uppercase\nend\n```\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"Ant\", \"Bee\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))  # prints: [\"Dog\",\"Elephant\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,345],"elapsed":5.955346505,"_type":"aimessage"}]
