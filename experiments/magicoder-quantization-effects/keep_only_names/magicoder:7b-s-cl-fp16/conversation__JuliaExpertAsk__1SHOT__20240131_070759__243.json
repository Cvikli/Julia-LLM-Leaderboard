The anonymous function checks whether the first character of each word is an uppercase letter using the `isuppercase` function and the `first` function.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Outputs: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,186],"elapsed":3.209932605,"_type":"aimessage"}]
