[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

The function works by iterating over each word in the provided list and checking if the first character of that word is an uppercase letter. If it is, we add that word to the result array. At the end of the function, we return the result array which contains only the words from the original list that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[231,203],"elapsed":7.952744929,"_type":"aimessage"}]
