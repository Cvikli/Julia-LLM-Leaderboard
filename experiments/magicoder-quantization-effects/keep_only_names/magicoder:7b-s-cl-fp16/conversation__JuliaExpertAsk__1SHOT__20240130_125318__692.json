The condition is defined as `x -> x[1] == uppercase(x[1])`, which means that it retains words where the first letter of the word (`x[1]`) is equal to its uppercase version (`uppercase(x[1])`).\n\nTo test this function, you can create a vector with some names:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"elephant\", \"Elephant\"]\nprint(keep_only_names(words))\n```\nThe output should be `[\"Dog\", \"Elephant\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,223],"elapsed":3.904261108,"_type":"aimessage"}]
