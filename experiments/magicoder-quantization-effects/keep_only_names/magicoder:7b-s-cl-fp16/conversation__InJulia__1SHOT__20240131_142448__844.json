The anonymous function checks if the first character of each word is capitalized by comparing it with its uppercase version. If it matches, the word is kept; otherwise, it's discarded.\n\nHere is how you can use this function:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"apple\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words)) # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,193],"elapsed":3.327885355,"_type":"aimessage"}]
