It checks each word to see if it starts with a capital letter using `word[0].isupper()`. If it does, it includes that word in the new list. If not, it ignores that word. The resulting list is then returned by the function.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```python\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"doggy\", \"Cat\", \"bird\"]\nprint(keep_only_names(words))  # Outputs: ['Dog', 'Bird']\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,182],"elapsed":3.13105633,"_type":"aimessage"}]
