[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem by using the built-in `startswith` function in Julia which checks if the string starts with a given character or sequence of characters. Here's how you could implement it:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(word -> !isempty(word) && startswith(word, uppercase(first(word))), words)\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `filter` function to create a new array that includes only those elements from the input array (`words`) where the condition is met: the word starts with a capital letter. \n\nThe `startswith` function checks whether the string (`word`) starts with the specified character sequence (the uppercase version of the first character of `word`). The `uppercase` function converts the first character of `word` to its uppercase equivalent if it is lowercase, and leaves it as is if it's already in uppercase.\n\nThe `!isempty(word)` check ensures that non-empty strings are kept even if they don't start with a capital letter (this was mentioned in the problem statement).\n\nThe function finally returns this filtered array of words, which only contains those words that meet the criteria specified in the task.","status":200,"tokens":[0,272],"elapsed":4.830172448,"_type":"aimessage"}]
