This code defines a function `keep_only_names` which takes a list of strings as input and returns the filtered list:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(x -> x[1] == uppercase(x[1]), words)\nend\n```\nThis function uses Julia's built-in `filter` function to iterate over each element in the input list. It checks whether the first character of a word is a capital letter by comparing it with its uppercase version (`uppercase(x[1])`). If it is, the word is kept; otherwise, it is removed from the output.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Outputs: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```\nIn the example above, only words starting with a capital letter are kept.","status":200,"tokens":[68,236],"elapsed":4.073431396,"_type":"aimessage"}]
