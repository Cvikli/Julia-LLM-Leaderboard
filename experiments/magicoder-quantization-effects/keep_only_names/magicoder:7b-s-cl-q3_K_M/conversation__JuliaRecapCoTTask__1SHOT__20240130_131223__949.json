[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem in Julia, we will define a function `keep_only_names` that uses the `filter` function to iterate over the words and retain only those which start with a capital letter. \n\nThe `isupper(c)` function returns `true` if the character is uppercase (A-Z). The `startswith` function checks if the string starts with another string. Combining these, we can use an anonymous function to filter out words that don't start with a capital letter. Here is how you might define this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(word -> isupper(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\n\nThe `filter` function takes an iterable and applies a predicate (the anonymous function here), keeping only the elements for which the predicate returns `true`.\n\nThe `first(word)` operation gets the first character of the word, which we compare with `isupper(c)`. If it's uppercase, `first(word)` will return `true` and the word will be kept. \n\nNote: Julia's indexing starts from 1 not zero so the `first(word)` gives the first character of the string (word in this case).\n\nThe `isupper(c)` checks if the input is uppercase or not, it returns a boolean value (`true` for uppercase and `false` otherwise).\n\nNow, to use this function with your special instructions, you can replace \"words\" with your list of words. For example:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bear\", \"Lion\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)\n```\nThis will print: `[\"Dog\", \"Bear\"]`. \n\nRemember to replace `\"words\"` with your actual list of words. Also, you may need to modify the function according to any specific instructions given in \"instructions\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,438],"elapsed":3.489363293,"_type":"aimessage"}]
