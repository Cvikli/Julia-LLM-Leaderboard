Here, `uppercase(first(x))` checks if the first character of a word `x` is an uppercase letter.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"elephant\", \"Elephant\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words)) # prints: [\"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"Elephant\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,205],"elapsed":1.581143993,"_type":"aimessage"}]
