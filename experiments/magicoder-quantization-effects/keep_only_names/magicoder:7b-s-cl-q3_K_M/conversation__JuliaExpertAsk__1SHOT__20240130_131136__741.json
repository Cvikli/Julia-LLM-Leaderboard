We use it to check if the first letter of each word is an upper case letter. If it is, we add that word to our result array.\n\nYou can call this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\"]\nprint(keep_only_names(words))\n```\nThis will print `[\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,195],"elapsed":1.497471166,"_type":"aimessage"}]
