If a word starts with an uppercase letter (checked using `first(word) == uppercase(first(word))` and if it is not empty), we push it to a new list called `new_words`. This function finally returns this `new_words` list which contains only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nYou can call this function like:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\"]\nnew_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprint(new_words)\n```\nThis will output `[\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,248],"elapsed":1.901226376,"_type":"aimessage"}]
