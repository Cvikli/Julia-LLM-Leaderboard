The condition inside the `filter` function (`->`) checks if the first character of a string is a capital letter using the `uppercase` and `first` functions. If it is, then the word is kept; otherwise, it's removed from the final result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,130],"elapsed":1.000434613,"_type":"aimessage"}]
