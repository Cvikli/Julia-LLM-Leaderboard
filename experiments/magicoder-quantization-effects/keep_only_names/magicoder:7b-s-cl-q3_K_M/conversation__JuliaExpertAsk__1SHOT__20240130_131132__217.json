The anonymous function passed to `filter!` checks if a word starts with an uppercase letter by converting the first character of each word to its uppercase equivalent (via `uppercase(first(word))`) and checking if this is equal to the first character of the string (`startswith(word, uppercase(first(word)))`). If it's not, the word is removed from the list.","status":200,"tokens":[98,166],"elapsed":1.313232221,"_type":"aimessage"}]
