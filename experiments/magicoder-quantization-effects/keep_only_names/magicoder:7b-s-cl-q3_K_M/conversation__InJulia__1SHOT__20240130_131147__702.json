It checks whether the first character of the word (indexed as `word[1]`) is uppercase. If it is, it adds that word to a results array (`result`). Finally, it returns the result array. \n\nYou can call this function with your list of words like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Bird\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words)) # Outputs: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Bird\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[68,243],"elapsed":1.91346898,"_type":"aimessage"}]
