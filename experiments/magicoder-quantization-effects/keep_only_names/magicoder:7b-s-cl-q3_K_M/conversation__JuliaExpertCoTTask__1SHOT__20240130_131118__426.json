It does this by iterating over each word in `words`. If the first character of the word is the same as its uppercase version (which means it's a capital), it gets added to the `keep` array. Finally, the function returns the `keep` array.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\nprint(keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]))\n# Output: [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,219],"elapsed":1.69902797,"_type":"aimessage"}]
