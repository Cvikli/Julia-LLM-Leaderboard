Here is an example function definition:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Array{String, 1})\n    return filter(x -> islowercase(x[1]) || x == \"\", words)\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `filter` function to iterate over each element in the list. The anonymous function inside `filter` checks if a word starts with a lowercase letter or is an empty string (`\"\"`). If either condition is true, it keeps that word, otherwise it removes it. \n\nHere's how you can call this function:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\", \"\", \"dog\", \"Cat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln.(filtered_words)\n```\nThis will output `[\"Dog\",\"Cat\",\"Cat\",\"Cat\"]`. Notice that the word \"dog\" was removed as it doesn't start with a capital letter, but the words \"cat\", \"Cat\", and \"\" were kept because they do start with capital letters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,249],"elapsed":1.9966008,"_type":"aimessage"}]
