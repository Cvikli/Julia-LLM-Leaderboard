[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, Write a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return [word for word in words if first(word) == uppercase(first(word))]\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the `words` array, and includes only those words that start with a capital letter (`uppercase(first(word))`). The `first(word)` call gets the first character of each word, and `uppercase(first(word))` returns this as an uppercase string.\n  \nYou can use this function to filter out names in your list:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Fox\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words)) # Outputs: [\"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Fox\"]\n```\nPlease note that this function assumes the words are case-sensitive. If your list of words includes both capitalized and lowercase names (like \"dog\" and \"Dog\"), you may want to convert all names to either upper or lower case before comparing them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,254],"elapsed":2.0261641,"_type":"aimessage"}]
