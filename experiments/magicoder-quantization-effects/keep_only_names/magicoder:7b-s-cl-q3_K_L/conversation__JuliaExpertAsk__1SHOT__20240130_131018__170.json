The condition `first(word) == uppercase(first(word))` checks whether the first character of the word is capitalized (i.e., it's an uppercase letter). If it is, the word gets included in the new list `new_words`.\n\nYou can call this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))  # Output: [\"Dog\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,194],"elapsed":1.550622856,"_type":"aimessage"}]
