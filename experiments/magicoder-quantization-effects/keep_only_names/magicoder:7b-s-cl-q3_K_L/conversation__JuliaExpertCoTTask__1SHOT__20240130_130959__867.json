It does this by using the built-in `first` and `uppercase` functions in Julia. The `first` function returns the first element of an array, while `uppercase` converts a string to uppercase.\n\nIf you call `keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])`, it will return `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,173],"elapsed":1.389868221,"_type":"aimessage"}]
