[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you might write such function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    result = String[]  # to store final names, initially empty\n\n    for word in words  # iterate over all the words\n        if isuppercase(word[1]) && !isempty(word)  # check if a word starts with capital letter and not an empty string\n            push!(result, word)  # if it does then add to result\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\n\nNow, you can test this function using the provided data:\n\n```julia\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]))\n```\n\nThis will output `Any[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`.
