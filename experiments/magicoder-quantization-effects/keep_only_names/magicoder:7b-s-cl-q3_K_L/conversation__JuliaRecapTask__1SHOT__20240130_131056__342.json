[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can accomplish this task by using Julia's built-in functions `startswith` to check if the first character of each word is a capital and `filter!` to remove words that do not start with a capital letter:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words) \n    filter!(word -> startswith(word, uppercase(word[1])), words)\nend\n```\n\nHere's how it works: `startswith` checks if the string `word` starts with the character(s) provided as a second argument. In this case, we are checking if the first character of the word (accessed by `word[1]`) is uppercase using `uppercase`. The `filter!` function removes all elements that do not satisfy the condition given to it â€” in our case, words for which `startswith(word, uppercase(word[1]))` is false.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"Aardvark\"]\nkeep_only_names(words)\n```\n\nThis will return `[\"Dog\", \"Bird\", \"Aardvark\"]` because only words starting with a capital letter are kept.","status":200,"tokens":[0,279],"elapsed":2.301517476,"_type":"aimessage"}]
