For each word, it checks if the first character is a capital letter and the rest of the characters are lowercase. If that's true, it adds the word to our result array (`new_words`). At the end of the function, we return `new_words`, which contains only the words that start with a capital letter followed by lowercase letters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,218],"elapsed":1.737431602,"_type":"aimessage"}]
