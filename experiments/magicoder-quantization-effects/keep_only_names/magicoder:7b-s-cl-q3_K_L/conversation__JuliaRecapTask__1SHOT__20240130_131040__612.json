[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution for the task using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # filter function to check if a word starts with an uppercase letter\n    starts_with_uppercase = x -> first(x) == uppercase(first(x))\n\n    # filter function to check if a word is uppercase\n    is_uppercase = x -> all(y->y==uppercase(y), x)\n\n    # use the two functions together to keep only words that start with an uppercase letter\n    return filter(starts_with_uppercase, words)\nend\n```\nThis function `keep_only_names` takes a vector of strings as input and returns a new vector containing only the elements from the original vector which starts with an uppercase letter. This is done using Julia's built-in functions like filter and first. \n\nFor example, calling `keep_only_names([\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"dOg\"])` would return `[\"Cat\", \"Dog\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[368,235],"elapsed":1.975331639,"_type":"aimessage"}]
