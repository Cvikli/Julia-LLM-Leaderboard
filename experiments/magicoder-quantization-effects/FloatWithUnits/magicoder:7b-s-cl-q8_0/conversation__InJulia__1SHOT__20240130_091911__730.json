Here is an example:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T<:AbstractFloat}\n    value::T\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\nend\n```\nThis `Base.show` function takes two arguments: an IO object (which you can think of as a \"screen\" where your printed output will appear) and an instance of the struct FloatWithUnits. It uses the value and unit fields to print them together in the format specified by the user.","status":200,"tokens":[0,166],"elapsed":1.842748997,"_type":"aimessage"}]
