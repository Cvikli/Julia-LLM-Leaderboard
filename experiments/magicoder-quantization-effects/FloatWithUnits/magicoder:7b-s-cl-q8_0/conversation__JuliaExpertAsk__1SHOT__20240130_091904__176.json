In the show method, you can simply return a string that represents the instance of the FloatWithUnits object. Here is an example:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\nend\n```\nIn this code, `Base.show` is a built-in function that is called when you try to print an object of the FloatWithUnits type. Inside this function, we use string interpolation (`\"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\"`) to format our output in the desired way.\n\nYou can test it with the following code:\n\n```julia\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,240],"elapsed":2.673123745,"_type":"aimessage"}]
