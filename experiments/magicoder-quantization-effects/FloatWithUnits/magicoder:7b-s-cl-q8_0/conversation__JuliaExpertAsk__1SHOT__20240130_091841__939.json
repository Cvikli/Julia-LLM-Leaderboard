For simplicity, I'm going to assume the unit is simply appended at the end after a whitespace.\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, x::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(x.value) $(x.unit)\")\nend\n\n# Test the show method\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # Output: 1.8 meters\n```\nThis `show` function takes an IO stream (which can be a string in memory for testing purposes), an instance of FloatWithUnits, and prints the value followed by a space and then the unit. The @$ macro is used to ensure that the variables are interpolated correctly within the string.","status":200,"tokens":[105,205],"elapsed":2.308009961,"_type":"aimessage"}]
