Here's an example of how you could implement it:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T <: Real}\n    value::T\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, f::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(f.value) $(f.unit)\")\nend\n```\nIn this example, `Base.show` is a built-in function in Julia that controls how objects are printed to the console. We define our own method for `FloatWithUnits` where we format `f.value` and `f.unit` as `\"$f.value $f.unit\"`, which is then passed to `print`.\n\nHere's an example of how you could use this:\n```julia\njulia> f = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,243],"elapsed":2.701732141,"_type":"aimessage"}]
