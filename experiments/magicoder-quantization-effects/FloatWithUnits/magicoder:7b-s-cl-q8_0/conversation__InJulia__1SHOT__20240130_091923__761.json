Here's how to do it:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T} <: Real\n    value::T\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, u::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(u.value)$(u.unit)\")\nend\n```\nIn this case, `T` is a placeholder for the type of the value field (e.g., `Float64`). The function `Base.show` takes two arguments: an I/O stream (`io`) and your object (`u`), then it uses the `$()` macro to print out the formatted string.\n\nNow, if you create a `FloatWithUnits` struct like this:\n```julia\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n```\nand print it using `print`, you will get `\"1.8 meters\"` as output.","status":200,"tokens":[0,238],"elapsed":2.653436559,"_type":"aimessage"}]
