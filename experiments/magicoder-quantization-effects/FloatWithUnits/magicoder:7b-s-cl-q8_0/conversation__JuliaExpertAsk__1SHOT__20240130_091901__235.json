It's called whenever you try to print an object with the `println`, `print`, etc functions. \n\nIn our case, we define a new method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct where we specify that the type of the first argument is `IO`. This means it's writing to some output stream (like the standard console). The second parameter is an object of our FloatWithUnits struct. Inside this function, we simply print the value and unit separated by a space.\n\nLet's see how you can use this: \n```julia\na = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(a) # it will print \"1.8 meters\" to the console\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,257],"elapsed":2.872239081,"_type":"aimessage"}]
