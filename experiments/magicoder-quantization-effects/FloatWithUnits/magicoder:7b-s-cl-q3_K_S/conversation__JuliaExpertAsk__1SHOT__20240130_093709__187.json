This method formats the output as \"value unit\", where value and unit are the fields of the struct. The `io::IO` argument tells Julia which I/O stream to write to, in this case the standard output (console). \n\nHere is how you can test it:\n\n```julia\nu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(u) # Outputs: \"1.8 meters\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,223],"elapsed":1.716857554,"_type":"aimessage"}]
