Here we define our own version of the function where we print the value and unit in the format \"value unit\". In this case, `io::IO` will be the output stream (usually the console), `x::FloatWithUnits` will be the object to display its string representation and `print(io, \"$(x.value) $(x.unit)\")`. \n\nPlease remember that you also need to include this code in a file and load it into your Julia environment to use it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,201],"elapsed":1.570187859,"_type":"aimessage"}]
