Here's an example:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\nend\n```\n\nIn this example, `Base.show` is a function that takes an input-output stream pair (`io`) and a `FloatWithUnits` object (`fwu`). It prints the value and unit of `fwu` to `io`. \n\nFor instance:\n\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu) # Will print \"1.8 meters\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[74,218],"elapsed":1.698695321,"_type":"aimessage"}]
