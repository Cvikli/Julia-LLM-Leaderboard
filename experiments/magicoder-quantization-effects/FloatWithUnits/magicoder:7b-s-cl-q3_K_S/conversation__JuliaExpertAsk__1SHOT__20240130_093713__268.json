The `show` function is defined in such a way that it automatically handles both FloatWithUnits{Float64} and FloatWithUnits{AbstractFloat}. \n\nYou would need to also define a method for unitstr that returns the default unit for FloatWithUnits. You may want to add methods for `unitstr` for different units you wish to support, such as `centimeters`, `feet`, etc. If you have a lot of different units and/or values types, you may want to define your own abstract type that all your unit types inherit from. \n\nPlease note that you need to call the function with the desired parameter in order for it to work, like FloatWithUnits{Float64}(18).","status":200,"tokens":[0,313],"elapsed":2.430813598,"_type":"aimessage"}]
