Here's how you would do it:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T}\n    value::T\n    unit::String\nend\n\nBase.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits) = @printf(\"%f %s\", fwu.value, fwu.unit)\n```\nThis will print the float value followed by space and the units in this format: \"1.8 meters\". Note that `@printf` is a macro that accepts a string with placeholders (like `%s`, `%d`) to format the output and values.\n\nRemember, though, it's a good idea to define `FloatWithUnits` fields properly and also implement other methods like the equality method (`==`), inequality method (`!=`), etc., depending on your needs.","status":200,"tokens":[0,202],"elapsed":1.576304005,"_type":"aimessage"}]
