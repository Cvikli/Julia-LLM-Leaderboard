After converting the value into string, you can concatenate it with your unit using `*`.\n\nHere is an example of how a possible show method might look like:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T}  # define struct\n    value::T\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, u::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, string(u.value), \" \", u.unit)\nend\n\n# define unit and its conversion function\nconst Unit = Float64\nconst cm_to_m = Float64(100)  # conversion rate from centimeters to meters\n\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T} <: Unit\n    value::T\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, u::FloatWithUnits{Unit}) where {T<:Number}\n    print(io, string(u.value/cm_to_m), \" meters\")\nend\n```\n\nIn this example, `FloatWithUnits` is a struct which contains the value and unit, the `show` function for it prints the value with its unit in the desired format. Also there's another struct called FloatWithUnits{Unit} to represent units of measure in meters (cm_to_m conversion rate). The `show` method for that struct also exists to print the value in the desired unit.","status":200,"tokens":[0,326],"elapsed":2.543045392,"_type":"aimessage"}]
