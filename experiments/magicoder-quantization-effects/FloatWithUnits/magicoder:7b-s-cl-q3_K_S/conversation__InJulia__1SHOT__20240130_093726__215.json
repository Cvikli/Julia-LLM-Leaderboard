Here's how you do it:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T} \n    value::T\n    unit::String\nend\n\nBase.show(io::IO, x::FloatWithUnits) = print(io, x.value, \" \", x.unit)\n```\nThe `show` function accepts two parameters: the IO stream where it should output its content (in this case, the standard output) and an object of type FloatWithUnits. This function will concatenate the value and unit with a space, as required. \n\nYou can test this method with the following code:\n\n```julia\nx = FloatWithUnits{Float64}(1.8,\"meters\")\nprintln(x) # Should print \"1.8 meters\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,196],"elapsed":1.529073193,"_type":"aimessage"}]
