It takes two arguments: an I/O stream (`io`) and an instance of `FloatWithUnits`. The function prints out a string representation of the struct with appropriate spacing between value and unit.\n\nNote that you may need to add more functionality for the `show` method, depending on how you want it to work with different types or circumstances.","status":200,"tokens":[0,180],"elapsed":1.406151923,"_type":"aimessage"}]
