It takes two parameters: an IO object and an instance of `FloatWithUnits`.\n- `print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")`: This line prints out the value and unit of the struct in a formatted string. The `$()` syntax is used to interpolate the values of variables into strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,233],"elapsed":1.94383248,"_type":"aimessage"}]
