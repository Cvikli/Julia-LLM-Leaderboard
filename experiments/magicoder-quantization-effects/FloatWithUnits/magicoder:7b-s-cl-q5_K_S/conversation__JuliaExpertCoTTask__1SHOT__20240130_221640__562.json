The `Base.show` function is used to print an object in Julia, and we use this to print our `FloatWithUnits` objects.\n\nYou can test this with:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[230,188],"elapsed":9.299505513,"_type":"aimessage"}]
