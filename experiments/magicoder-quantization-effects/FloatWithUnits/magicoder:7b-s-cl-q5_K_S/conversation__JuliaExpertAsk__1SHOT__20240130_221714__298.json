It then prints the value and unit of the struct to the given IO stream with a space in between. Note that we're using string interpolation (`$(...)`) to print out the value and unit fields of our struct.\n\nHere is how you can use this `show` method:\n\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,213],"elapsed":1.77668256,"_type":"aimessage"}]
