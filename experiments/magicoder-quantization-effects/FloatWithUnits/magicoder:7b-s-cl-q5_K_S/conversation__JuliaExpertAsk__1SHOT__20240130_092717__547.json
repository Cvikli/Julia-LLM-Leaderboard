The function signature is `Base.show(io::IO, x::FloatWithUnits)`. Here, `IO` stands for Input/Output stream, and `x` is an instance of your struct `FloatWithUnits`.\n\nNow you can create a `FloatWithUnits` object:\n```julia\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(f)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,218],"elapsed":1.871254402,"_type":"aimessage"}]
