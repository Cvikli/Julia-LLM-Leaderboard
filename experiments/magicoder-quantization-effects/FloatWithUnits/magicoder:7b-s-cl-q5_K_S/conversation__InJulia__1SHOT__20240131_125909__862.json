This function takes two arguments: `io`, which is an I/O stream (like a file or console), and `fwu`, which is an instance of `FloatWithUnits`.\n- The `print` function writes the string representation of its arguments to the specified IO stream. Here, it writes `fwu.value`, a space, and `fwu.unit` to the I/O stream.","status":200,"tokens":[0,245],"elapsed":2.061190168,"_type":"aimessage"}]
