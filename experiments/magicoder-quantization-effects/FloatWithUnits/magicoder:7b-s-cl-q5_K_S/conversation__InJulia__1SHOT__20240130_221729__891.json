Here is how you would define a show method for FloatWithUnits:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T<:Real}\n    value::T\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\nend\n```\nIn this code, `Base.show` is the built-in function for displaying an object to the console. The second argument `io::IO` specifies the output stream (usually the console), and `fwu::FloatWithUnits` specifies that we are going to display a FloatWithUnits object.\n\nThe `print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")` line prints the value and unit of the FloatWithUnits object to the output stream. The `$(...) syntax is used for string interpolation, which replaces variables inside the brackets with their values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,242],"elapsed":2.008967138,"_type":"aimessage"}]
