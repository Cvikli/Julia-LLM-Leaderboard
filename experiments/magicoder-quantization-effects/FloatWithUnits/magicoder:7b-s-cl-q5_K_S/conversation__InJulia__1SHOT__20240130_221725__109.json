We then implement the `show` function for this type. This function is responsible for printing the value and unit of the object when it's printed to the console. The `print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")`, line does exactly that by concatenating the value and unit with a space in between and then printing it to the provided IO stream (in this case, the standard output).","status":200,"tokens":[0,207],"elapsed":1.719104062,"_type":"aimessage"}]
