We then write a function `show` that takes an I/O stream (like the console or a file), a FloatWithUnits object (`fwu`), and prints the value and unit.\n\nYou can test this code with your example like this:\n```julia\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[230,198],"elapsed":6.787434105,"_type":"aimessage"}]
