We then implement the `show` function for this type, which prints out the value and unit in the format \"value unit\".\n\nYou can use it like this:\n\n```julia\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(f)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,194],"elapsed":1.610398564,"_type":"aimessage"}]
