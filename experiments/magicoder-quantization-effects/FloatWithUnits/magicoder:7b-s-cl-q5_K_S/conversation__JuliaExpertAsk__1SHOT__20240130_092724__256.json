The `show` function is defined to take an IO stream and an instance of FloatWithUnits. Inside the function, it uses print to write out the value and unit in the required format.\n\nTo use this `show` method, you can then do:\n\n```julia\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(f) # This will output: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,221],"elapsed":1.900881474,"_type":"aimessage"}]
