X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a struct `FloatWithUnits` with fields `value` and `unit` (make sure to define it!), write a `show` method for it that will concatenate the value and unit with a space like this \"1.8 meters\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The `show` function in Julia is used to print out an object's contents. For custom types, we typically override this function by defining our own version of the `show` method. \n\nHere's a simple way you could implement the `FloatWithUnits` struct and its `show` method:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T}\n    value::T\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, f::FloatWithUnits) \n    print(io, \"$(f.value) $(f.unit)\")\nend\n```\nThe `Base.show` function is a method in Julia that gets called when you try to display an object to the console. You can override this method for your own custom types. In our case, we want to display the value and unit of our FloatWithUnits object like \"1.8 meters\". This is done by passing a string to `print(io, ...)` that includes both the value and unit.\n\nYou would use it like:\n```julia\nf = FloatWithUnits{Float64}(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(f)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,271],"elapsed":2.384226955,"_type":"aimessage"}]
