The type parameter `T` is used to allow the `FloatWithUnits` to hold values of any numeric type.\n- Then we implement the `show` method for `FloatWithUnits`. This function is called when you print an instance of `FloatWithUnits`, i.e., when you do `print(io, x)`, where `x` is an instance of `FloatWithUnits`. The `*` operator is used to concatenate the value and unit with a space in between.\n\nYou can test this method using:\n```julia\njulia> FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,255],"elapsed":2.16993471,"_type":"aimessage"}]
