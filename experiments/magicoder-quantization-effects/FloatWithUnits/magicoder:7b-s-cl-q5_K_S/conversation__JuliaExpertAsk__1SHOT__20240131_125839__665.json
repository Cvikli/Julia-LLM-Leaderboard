We also define the `show` function for this struct.\n\nThe `Base.show` method takes an I/O stream (`io::IO`) and an object to be shown (`fwu::FloatWithUnits`). Inside the function, we use Julia's built-in string interpolation feature to print out the value and unit of the FloatWithUnits instance in a formatted manner.\n\nYou can then create instances of `FloatWithUnits` and print them:\n\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[105,286],"elapsed":2.45148102,"_type":"aimessage"}]
