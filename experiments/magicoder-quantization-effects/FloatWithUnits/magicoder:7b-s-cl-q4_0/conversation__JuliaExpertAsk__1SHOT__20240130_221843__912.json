It takes two arguments: the IO stream and the object itself (`fwu::FloatWithUnits`). The `print` function writes the string representation of the object to the specified IO stream.\n\nThe `FloatWithUnits{T<:AbstractFloat}` line defines a struct that has a value of type T (which is an AbstractFloat) and a unit as a String.\n\nYou can now use this struct like so:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,244],"elapsed":1.798821068,"_type":"aimessage"}]
