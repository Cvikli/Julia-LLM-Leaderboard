Then you can write a `show` method for the type that will concatenate the value and unit with a space. Here is how to do it in Julia:\n\n```julia\n# Define FloatWithUnits struct\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T<:Real}\n    value::T\n    unit::String\nend\n\n# Write show method for FloatWithUnits\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, f::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(f.value) $(f.unit)\")\nend\n```\n\nNow you can create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and print it:\n\n```julia\njulia> f = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n\njulia> show(f)\n1.8 meters\n```\nThis is the output you should get when running `show(f)`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,229],"elapsed":1.761314681,"_type":"aimessage"}]
