The `show` function is implemented to print the value and unit in the format \"1.8 meters\".\n\nYou can test it by creating an instance of `FloatWithUnits`:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # Output: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,193],"elapsed":1.442298696,"_type":"aimessage"}]
