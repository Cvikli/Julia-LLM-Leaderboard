Here's how you might do it:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T<:Real}\n    value::T\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    write(io, string(fwu.value)) # write the value to IO\n    write(io, \" \") # add a space for formatting\n    write(io, fwu.unit) # write the unit to IO\nend\n```\nIn this code snippet, we first define a struct `FloatWithUnits`. Inside this struct, you can see two fields: `value` and `unit`. These fields hold the actual value of the float along with its corresponding unit.\n\nNext, we define the `show` function which takes in an IO object (like stdout) and our `FloatWithUnits` type as arguments. Inside this function, we use the built-in `write` function to write to the IO object the string representation of the value (converted by `string`) and then a space followed by the unit.\n\nYou can now call your struct like so:\n```julia\nprint(FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\"))\n```\nThis will output: `1.8 meters`","status":200,"tokens":[0,313],"elapsed":2.393116008,"_type":"aimessage"}]
