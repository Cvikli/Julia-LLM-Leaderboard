The `show` function is then defined to print the value and unit in the format \"1.8 meters\". Note that the `string` function is used to convert the floating point number into a String, and the `print` function is used to output this string followed by a space and the unit.","status":200,"tokens":[0,213],"elapsed":1.588010074,"_type":"aimessage"}]
