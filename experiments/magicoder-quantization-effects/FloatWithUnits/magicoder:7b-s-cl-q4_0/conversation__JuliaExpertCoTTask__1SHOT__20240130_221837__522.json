We then implement the `show` function for this struct. The `Base.show` function is used to print an object in Julia. In our case, it prints the value and unit of the `FloatWithUnits` object. \n\nYou can test this code with the following:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu) # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,211],"elapsed":1.56298833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
