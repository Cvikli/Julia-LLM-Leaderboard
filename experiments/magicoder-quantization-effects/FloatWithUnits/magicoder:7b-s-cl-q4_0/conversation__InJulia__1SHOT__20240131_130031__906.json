We then implement the `show` function for this struct. This function takes an IO object (which is typically a text stream) and a `FloatWithUnits` object as arguments. Inside the function, we print to the IO object the value and unit of the FloatWithUnits object, separated by a space.\n\nYou can use this `show` method like this:\n```julia\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,230],"elapsed":1.711655939,"_type":"aimessage"}]
