Here is an example:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T}\n    value::T\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\nend\n```\nIn the above code snippet:\n- `struct FloatWithUnits{T}` defines a struct with one generic parameter `T`.\n- `Base.show` is a method to display an object. Here it's customized for `FloatWithUnits` type.\n- Inside the function, you print the value and unit of the given `FloatWithUnits` instance. Note that `io` here stands for input/output stream which can be a console or in our case a string buffer.\n\nYou can now create an object of this struct with a value and a unit like:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits{Float64}(1.8, \"meters\")\nprint(fwu) # it will print: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[105,260],"elapsed":2.011373737,"_type":"aimessage"}]
