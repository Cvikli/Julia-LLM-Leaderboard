We then override the `show` function for this type so that it prints out the value and unit in the desired format. The `print(io, \"$(f.value) $(f.unit)\")` line does the actual printing: it concatenates the value and unit with a space between them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,189],"elapsed":1.386240973,"_type":"aimessage"}]
