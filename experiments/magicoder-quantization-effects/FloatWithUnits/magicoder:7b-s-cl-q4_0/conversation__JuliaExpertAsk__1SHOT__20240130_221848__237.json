The `Base.show` function is used to define how these values are printed when you call `print` on an instance of this struct. It concatenates the value and unit with a space between them.\n\nYou can use it like this:\n```julia\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(f)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,199],"elapsed":1.464910962,"_type":"aimessage"}]
