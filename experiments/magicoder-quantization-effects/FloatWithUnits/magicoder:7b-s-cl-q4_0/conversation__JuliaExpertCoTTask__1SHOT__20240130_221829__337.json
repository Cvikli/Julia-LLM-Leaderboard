It takes two arguments: `io`, which is the output stream (usually the console), and `x`, which is the object you want to display.\n- Inside this function, we use `print(io, \"$(x.value) $(x.unit)\")`, which prints the value of x followed by a space and then the unit. The `$(x.value)` and `$(x.unit)` are interpolated strings that replace these parts with the actual values from x.\n\nYou can now test this function:\n```julia\njulia> FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,291],"elapsed":2.161943405,"_type":"aimessage"}]
