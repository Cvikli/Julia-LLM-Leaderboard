We then implement the `show` function for this struct to concatenate the value and unit with a space in between them when printing.\n\nYou can use this `FloatWithUnits` type like so:\n\n```julia\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(f)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,204],"elapsed":1.526676579,"_type":"aimessage"}]
