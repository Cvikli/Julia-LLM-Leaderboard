[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a struct `FloatWithUnits` with fields `value` and `unit` (make sure to define it!), write a `show` method for it that will concatenate the value and unit with a space like this \"1.8 meters\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T<:AbstractFloat}\n    value::T\n    unit::String\nend\n\nBase.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits) = print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\n```\nIn this code snippet, we define a `FloatWithUnits` struct that has two fields: `value` and `unit`. We also implement the `show` function for `FloatWithUnits` objects. This function takes an IO object (which is typically a file or standard output) and a `FloatWithUnits` object as arguments, and it prints to the IO object the value and unit of the `FloatWithUnits` object in the desired format.\n\nIf you have special instructions, please provide them so that I can adjust my solution accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,203],"elapsed":1.529860316,"_type":"aimessage"}]
