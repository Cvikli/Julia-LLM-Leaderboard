The custom show method we defined here will print the value followed by space and unit. For example, if you define an instance as follows: \n\n```julia\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n```\nand call `show()`, it would output `\"1.8 meters\"`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,187],"elapsed":1.409157338,"_type":"aimessage"}]
