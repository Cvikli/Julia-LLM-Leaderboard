The `value` field is of type Float64 and the `unit` field is of String type.\n- Then we define a function `show` that takes in an IO stream (which can be any object that Julia uses to output data), along with a `FloatWithUnits` instance (`f`), and prints out the value followed by the unit of the FloatWithUnits instance separated by a space.","status":200,"tokens":[0,188],"elapsed":1.426552265,"_type":"aimessage"}]
