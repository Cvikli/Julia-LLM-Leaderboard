We then implement the `show` function for this struct. This function takes an IO stream (`io`) and a `FloatWithUnits` object (`fwu`). Inside the function, we use `print(io, ...)` to print the value and unit of `fwu` on `io`. The string `\"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\"` is used to format the output string in the desired way.","status":200,"tokens":[0,224],"elapsed":1.664825079,"_type":"aimessage"}]
