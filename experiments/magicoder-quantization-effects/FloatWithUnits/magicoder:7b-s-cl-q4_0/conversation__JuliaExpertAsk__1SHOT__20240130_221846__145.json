It then prints the value of the FloatWithUnits object followed by its unit to the provided IO stream. The `Base.` before `show` is necessary because `show` is a function in Julia's Base module, not in your custom module.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(f)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,198],"elapsed":1.457702399,"_type":"aimessage"}]
