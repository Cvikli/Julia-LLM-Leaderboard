The fields `value` and `unit` are stored in instances of `FloatWithUnits`.\n\nThe function `Base.show(io::IO, f::FloatWithUnits)` defines a method for displaying an instance of `FloatWithUnits`, which concatenates the value and unit with a space and prints them to the specified IO stream (`io`).","status":200,"tokens":[0,207],"elapsed":1.545774146,"_type":"aimessage"}]
