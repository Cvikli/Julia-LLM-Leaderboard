Here is how you could do it:\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T <: AbstractFloat}\n    value::T \n    unit::String \nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, u::FloatWithUnits)\n    write(io, \"$(u.value) $(u.unit)\")\nend\n```\nThis will now print `1.8 meters` when you do `FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")` . \n\nNote: This code assumes that `AbstractFloat` is the type of the value field, which is typically a subtype of Float64. You can replace it with whatever concrete numeric type you want to use.","status":200,"tokens":[0,187],"elapsed":1.435866543,"_type":"aimessage"}]
