The `show` function is defined to take an IO (input/output) object and the FloatWithUnits instance as parameters. It then prints the value and unit of the FloatWithUnits instance separated by a space.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\njulia> f = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n\njulia> show(stdout, f)\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,210],"elapsed":1.563191718,"_type":"aimessage"}]
