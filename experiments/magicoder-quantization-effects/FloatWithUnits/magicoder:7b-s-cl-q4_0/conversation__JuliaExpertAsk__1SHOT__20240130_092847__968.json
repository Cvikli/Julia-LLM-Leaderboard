Then, we implement the `show` method for our `FloatWithUnits` struct. This function will be automatically called whenever you try to print an instance of `FloatWithUnits`.\n\nThe `Base.show` function in Julia takes two arguments: the I/O stream (`io`, which is where the output will go) and the object to be displayed (`x`). Here we just print out the value and unit fields of our struct separated by a space.","status":200,"tokens":[0,235],"elapsed":1.799852283,"_type":"aimessage"}]
