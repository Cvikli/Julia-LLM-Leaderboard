The string format is defined in the function body and includes the value and unit fields from your struct. \n\nPlease note that this example assumes that the `unit` field is a String, you can modify it to match any data type you need. For instance, if you'd like to have units as symbols instead of strings, replace `String` with `Symbol`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,200],"elapsed":1.495696572,"_type":"aimessage"}]
