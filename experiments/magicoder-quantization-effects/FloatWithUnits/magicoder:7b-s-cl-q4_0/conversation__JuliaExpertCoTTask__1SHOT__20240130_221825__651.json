The `show` function is then defined to concatenate these two fields with a space in between. This function will be called automatically when you print an object of type `FloatWithUnits`.\n\nLet's test this code with the provided data:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # Output: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,199],"elapsed":1.475101539,"_type":"aimessage"}]
