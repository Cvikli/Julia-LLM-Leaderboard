A struct is analogous to a class in object-oriented programming languages. Here is an example of how you could define `FloatWithUnits` as well as its corresponding `show` method:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T <: Real} \n    value::T\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\nend\n```\n\nNow you can create instances of `FloatWithUnits` and print them:\n\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits{Float64}(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # Prints \"1.8 meters\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,195],"elapsed":1.480908782,"_type":"aimessage"}]
