Then we implement the show method which is responsible for displaying this data in the form of a string. The `Base.show` function is used to define how Julia's printing system works and it needs to be defined to work properly with custom types. Inside the `show` method, the `print` function is used to print out the formatted output, where the value and unit are concatenated by a space in between. Finally, we test our implementation using an instance of `FloatWithUnits`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,243],"elapsed":1.840195812,"_type":"aimessage"}]
