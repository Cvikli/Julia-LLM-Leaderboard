By defining our own method for FloatWithUnits, we can control how it's printed. \n\nIn this case, we have defined a struct `FloatWithUnits`, which represents a floating point number paired with a unit (like \"meters\" or \"seconds\"). We want to print this in a nice format like `\"1.8 meters\"` or `\"2 seconds\"`.\n\nThe `Base.show` function takes two parameters: the IO stream (`io::IO`) and the value being printed (`u::FloatWithUnits`). We just print the value followed by a space and then the unit. This gives the output in the desired format. \n\nPlease note that this code does not include any validation or error handling, so it might not work correctly if you pass invalid values to `FloatWithUnits`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,274],"elapsed":2.090584252,"_type":"aimessage"}]
