This `show` function will override the default `Base.show` function which is responsible to print an object in Julia.\n\nThe first argument (`io`) refers to the output stream where you want to write your output, and `fwu::FloatWithUnits` refers to the instance of your struct that you're trying to print. The method concatenates the value and unit with a space between them, and then prints this string to the given I/O stream.","status":200,"tokens":[0,205],"elapsed":1.554368102,"_type":"aimessage"}]
