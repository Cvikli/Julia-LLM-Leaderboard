Then we implement the `show` method to display the struct in the desired format. The `Base.show` function is used for customizing how Julia's standard show method works on types that it does not have a custom method for, or for which the default method is not particularly useful.\nThe `show` function takes an IO stream and a FloatWithUnits object as input, and should print the object to the given IO stream in a format suitable for human consumption.\n\nHere's how you would create an instance of your struct and then display it:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # Output: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[105,258],"elapsed":1.97820859,"_type":"aimessage"}]
