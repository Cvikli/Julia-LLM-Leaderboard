Inside this function we've used string interpolation (`\"$variable\") to ensure that both the value and unit are correctly displayed. \n\nYou can test it with:\n```julia\njulia> f = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,236],"elapsed":1.822812022,"_type":"aimessage"}]
