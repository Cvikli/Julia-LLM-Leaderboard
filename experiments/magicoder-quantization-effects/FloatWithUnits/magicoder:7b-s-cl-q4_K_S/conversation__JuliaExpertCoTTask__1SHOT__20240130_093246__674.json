Inside the show method, `$(fwu.value)` and `$(fwu.unit)` are used to get the value and unit from the FloatWithUnits struct respectively.\n\nThe FloatWithUnits struct `FloatWithUnits{T}` has been defined with `value::T` and `unit::String`. `Base.show` is a built-in function in Julia for displaying an object to the console which can be overridden by custom functions like this one.\n\nThis code allows us to create a FloatWithUnits struct, and when printed or shown, it will concatenate the value and unit with a space in between. For instance:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu) # Prints 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,284],"elapsed":2.21410441,"_type":"aimessage"}]
