The `show` function takes in two parameters - an I/O stream (where the output will be written), and the instance of the `FloatWithUnits` struct. This function then prints out the value and unit, separated by a space. \n\nHere's how you could test this:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu) # Output should be: \"1.8 meters\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[105,217],"elapsed":1.704975291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
