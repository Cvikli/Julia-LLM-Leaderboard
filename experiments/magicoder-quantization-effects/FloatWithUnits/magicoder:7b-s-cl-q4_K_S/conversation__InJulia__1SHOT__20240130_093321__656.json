Then, we have written an overloaded function `Base.show`, which is responsible for displaying the values of the struct in the REPL. This function accepts two arguments: `io` (which stands for input/output stream), and `u` (the instance of the structure). Inside this function, we've used string interpolation (`\"$...\") to print out both the value and unit.\n\nNow, if you create an instance of `FloatWithUnits`, it will be displayed in a format like \"1.8 meters\". For example:\n```julia\njulia> f = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,260],"elapsed":2.011512906,"_type":"aimessage"}]
