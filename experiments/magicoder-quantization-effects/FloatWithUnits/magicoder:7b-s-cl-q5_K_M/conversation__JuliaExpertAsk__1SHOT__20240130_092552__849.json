The type parameter `T` of the struct is there to make sure that you can use any numeric type for the value field, not just floating-point numbers. \n\nThen, we define a function `Base.show(io::IO, x::FloatWithUnits)` that prints the value and unit of the `FloatWithUnits` instance `x`. Inside this function, `print(io, x.value * \" \", x.unit)` is used to print the value and unit to the provided I/O stream `io`. \n\nYou can use this `show` method like this:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu) # Prints \"1.8 meters\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,281],"elapsed":2.464236726,"_type":"aimessage"}]
