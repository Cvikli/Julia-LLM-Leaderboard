The `print` statement inside the function writes out the value and unit of the struct separated by a space. The `$(fwu.value)` syntax is used for string interpolation, which inserts the value of `fwu.value` at that spot in the string.\n  \nFor example:\n```julia\njulia> f = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,213],"elapsed":1.85753883,"_type":"aimessage"}]
