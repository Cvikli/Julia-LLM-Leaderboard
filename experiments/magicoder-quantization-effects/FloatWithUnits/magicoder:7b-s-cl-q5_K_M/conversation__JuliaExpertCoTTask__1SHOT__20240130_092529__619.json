Here we override it for our custom type `FloatWithUnits`. Inside the function, we call `print`, which directly writes to `io`. The arguments you pass are the fields of your struct `fwu`.\n\nNow when you use this in a REPL:\n```julia\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,204],"elapsed":1.791851175,"_type":"aimessage"}]
