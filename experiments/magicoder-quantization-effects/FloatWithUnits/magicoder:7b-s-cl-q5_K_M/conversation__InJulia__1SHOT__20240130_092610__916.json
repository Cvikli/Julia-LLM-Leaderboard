It then implements the function `show`, which is used to display objects in Julia's REPL. This function takes an IO object (which is what you would typically print to), as well as an instance of the struct FloatWithUnits. Inside the function, it prints out the value followed by a space and the unit of measurement.\n\nTo use this method, create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and then call `show` on that instance:\n```julia\nu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nshow(stdout, u)  # This will print \"1.8 meters\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,236],"elapsed":2.057630248,"_type":"aimessage"}]
