Then, we create a function called `show` inside the `Base` module which takes an `IO` object and an instance of our struct as arguments. Inside this function, we print out the value and unit of the struct separated by a space using string interpolation (`$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)`). \n\nYou can now create an instance of your `FloatWithUnits` struct like so:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n```\nAnd print it out to the console using `show`:\n```julia\nprintln(fwu)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,268],"elapsed":2.339634029,"_type":"aimessage"}]
