We then implement the `show` function for `FloatWithUnits` objects, which is used to print customized representations of `FloatWithUnits` objects when calling the `print` function. The `Base.show` method takes two arguments: an I/O stream (`io::IO`) and a FloatWithUnits object (`f::FloatWithUnits`). It uses string interpolation to print the value followed by a space and then the unit.","status":200,"tokens":[0,238],"elapsed":2.076310761,"_type":"aimessage"}]
