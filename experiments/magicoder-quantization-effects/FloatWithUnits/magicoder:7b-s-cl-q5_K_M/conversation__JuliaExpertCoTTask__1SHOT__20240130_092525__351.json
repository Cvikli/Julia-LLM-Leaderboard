We implement a custom show method for our struct using Base.show function which is one of the ways to override Base methods in Julia. In the implementation, we use string interpolation (`\"$x.value $x.unit\"`) to print both the value and the unit together with a space.\n\nThe test at the end demonstrates that this show method works as expected when given a FloatWithUnits object.","status":200,"tokens":[0,224],"elapsed":1.969628393,"_type":"aimessage"}]
