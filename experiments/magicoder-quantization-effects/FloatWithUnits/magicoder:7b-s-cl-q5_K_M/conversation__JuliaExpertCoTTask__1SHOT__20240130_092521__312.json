We use parametric types (`T <: AbstractFloat`) to make sure that `value` can be any subtype of `AbstractFloat`. \n\nWe then implement a `show` function for the `FloatWithUnits` type. This function is part of the `Base` module, which is automatically imported, and it's used by Julia's printing system to convert objects into strings when you call `print`, `println`, or other functions that accept an `IO` object as their first argument.\n\nInside the `show` method, we just print out a string that combines the value and unit with a space between them. The `$(x.value)` syntax is used to insert the value of the field into the string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,250],"elapsed":2.199397087,"_type":"aimessage"}]
