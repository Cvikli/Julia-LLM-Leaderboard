We then implement a `show` method for this struct which takes an I/O stream (`io`) and a `FloatWithUnits` object (`fwu`). The implementation of the `show` function is simply to print out the value and unit separated by a space.\n\nNow, if you try to show an instance of `FloatWithUnits`, it will output in the format \"1.8 meters\":\n```julia\njulia> FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,231],"elapsed":1.8208419,"_type":"aimessage"}]
