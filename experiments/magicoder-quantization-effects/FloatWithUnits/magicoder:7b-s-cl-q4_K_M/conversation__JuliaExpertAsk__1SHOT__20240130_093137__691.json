When called with an I/O stream and an instance of your `FloatWithUnits` type, it will print out the value and unit in a string separated by a space. For example:\n\n```julia\njulia> f = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n\njulia> show(f)\n\"1.8 meters\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,197],"elapsed":1.579408898,"_type":"aimessage"}]
