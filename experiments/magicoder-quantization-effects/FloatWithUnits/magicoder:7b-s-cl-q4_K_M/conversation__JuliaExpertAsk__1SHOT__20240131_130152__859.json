It takes two arguments: the IO stream where you want to write the output (like stdout), and the object you want to print (`f` in this case). The return type is `Nothing` because `show` functions don't usually return a value.\n- `print(io, f.value, \" \", f.unit)`: This line prints the value and unit of `f` on the IO stream `io`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,306],"elapsed":2.434230828,"_type":"aimessage"}]
