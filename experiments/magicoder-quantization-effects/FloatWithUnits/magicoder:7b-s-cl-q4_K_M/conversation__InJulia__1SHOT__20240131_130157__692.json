The function should start with the keyword `show`. You can use the built-in `print` or `println` functions to output text. Here is how you could define such a method for your `FloatWithUnits` struct:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T <: Real}\n    value::T\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\nend\n```\n\nIn this example, `show` is a function that takes two arguments: an output stream (an instance of the IO abstract type in Julia) and an instance of your struct `FloatWithUnits`. It then prints out the value and unit separated by a space. \n\nYou can use it like this:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprint(fwu) # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,252],"elapsed":1.997439086,"_type":"aimessage"}]
