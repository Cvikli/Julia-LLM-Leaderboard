We then implement the `show` method to print out a string that combines the value and unit, with a space in between.\n\nThe `Base.show` function is a built-in Julia function for displaying objects in the REPL. The second argument of this function (`x::FloatWithUnits`) specifies what object should be displayed. In our case, it's an instance of `FloatWithUnits`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,260],"elapsed":2.078733556,"_type":"aimessage"}]
