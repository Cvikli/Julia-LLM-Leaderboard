We then implement the `Base.show` function for this type, which prints out the value and unit in the format you specified. The `print(io, x.value, \" \", x.unit)` line is responsible for printing the value and unit to the provided IO stream (`io`).","status":200,"tokens":[0,172],"elapsed":1.344405553,"_type":"aimessage"}]
