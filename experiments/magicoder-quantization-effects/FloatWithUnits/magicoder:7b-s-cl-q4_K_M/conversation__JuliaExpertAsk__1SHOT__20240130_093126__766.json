The function `Base.show` is defined to take an IO stream (`io`) and an object of type `FloatWithUnits`. Inside the function, it prints the value and then the unit with a space in between.\n\nYou can test this method by creating instances of FloatWithUnits and printing them:\n```julia\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[105,210],"elapsed":1.712435381,"_type":"aimessage"}]
