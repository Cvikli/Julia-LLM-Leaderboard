The `value` field is of type `Float64`, which represents 64-bit floating point numbers, and the `unit` field is of type `String`, which represents strings.\n\n- We then define a function `Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)` that takes two arguments: an I/O stream (`io`) and an instance of `FloatWithUnits`. This function will be called when we try to print or show the `FloatWithUnits` object.\n\n- Inside this function, we use the built-in `print` function to concatenate the value and unit with a space and then print it out on the I/O stream (`io`).","status":200,"tokens":[105,267],"elapsed":2.120624898,"_type":"aimessage"}]
