The `print` function writes the string representation of its argument to the given IO stream. \n\nThe string `\"$fwu.value $fwu.unit\"` is interpolated, which means that it will be replaced by the values of `fwu.value` and `fwu.unit`. \n\nSo if you have a `FloatWithUnits` object `f`, when you try to print it, it will show \"1.8 meters\" as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[0,201],"elapsed":1.588247137,"_type":"aimessage"}]
