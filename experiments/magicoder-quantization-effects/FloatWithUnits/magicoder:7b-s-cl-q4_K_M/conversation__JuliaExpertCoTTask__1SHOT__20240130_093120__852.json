The second argument `io` represents the output stream and `fwu` stands for FloatWithUnits.\n\nHere, you use the fields `value` and `unit` to construct the string that will be printed. If we call `show(io, FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\"))`, it will print `\"1.8 meters\"` to the output stream `io`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,205],"elapsed":1.659031739,"_type":"aimessage"}]
