The `$(...)`, called string interpolation, is used to embed expressions inside strings.\n\nNow you can create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and print it:\n\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,332],"elapsed":2.628913699,"_type":"aimessage"}]
