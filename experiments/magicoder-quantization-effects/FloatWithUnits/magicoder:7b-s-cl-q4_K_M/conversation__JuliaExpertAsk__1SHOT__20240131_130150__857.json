Note that we will use `string` function to convert the numeric part of our struct into a string.\n\n```julia\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, string(fwu.value), \" \", fwu.unit)\nend\n```\n\nThis `show` function takes an I/O stream and a FloatWithUnits object as input. It then prints the value and unit of the FloatWithUnits object to the given IO stream. \n\nLet's test this:\n\n```julia\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n\njulia> show(stdout, fwu)\n1.8 meters\n```\nAs you can see the `show` method works as expected and prints the value and unit of our `FloatWithUnits` object in the format \"value unit\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,271],"elapsed":2.157273544,"_type":"aimessage"}]
