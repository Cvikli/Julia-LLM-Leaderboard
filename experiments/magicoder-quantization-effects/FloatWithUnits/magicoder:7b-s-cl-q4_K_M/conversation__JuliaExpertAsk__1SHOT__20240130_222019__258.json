It then prints the value and unit of the FloatWithUnits object to the provided IO stream. The `print` function is used instead of `println` so that there's no extra newline at the end of the output.\n\nYou can use this method like this:\n```julia\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,204],"elapsed":1.59472815,"_type":"aimessage"}]
