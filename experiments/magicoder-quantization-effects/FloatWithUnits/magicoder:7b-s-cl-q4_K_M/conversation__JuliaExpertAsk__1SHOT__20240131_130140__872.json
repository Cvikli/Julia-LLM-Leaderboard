The arguments to this function are an I/O stream (like stdout) and an instance of your struct.\n\nThe `io::IO` argument represents a generic I/O stream, which could be any kind of output device such as a file or the standard output.\n\nThe `fwu::FloatWithUnits` is the second argument to the function. It's the actual instance of `FloatWithUnits` that you want to print out. Here we are using type parameterization to ensure that our struct can only contain real numbers (i.e., `T<:Real`).\n\nInside the function, we use the built-in `print` function to write both the value and unit to the I/O stream. The `fwu.value` is the field of your struct that holds the numeric value, while `fwu.unit` contains the string representing the units.","status":200,"tokens":[0,324],"elapsed":2.579851721,"_type":"aimessage"}]
