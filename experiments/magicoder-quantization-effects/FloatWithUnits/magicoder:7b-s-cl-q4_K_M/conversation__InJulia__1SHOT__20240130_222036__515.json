The function takes two arguments: an IO stream (which represents the output of your program), and the object you want to print (`x::FloatWithUnits`). \n\nThe `print` function writes its arguments to the specified IO stream, separated by a space. In this case, it's writing `x.value`, a number, followed by a space, then `x.unit`, a string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,194],"elapsed":1.513497479,"_type":"aimessage"}]
