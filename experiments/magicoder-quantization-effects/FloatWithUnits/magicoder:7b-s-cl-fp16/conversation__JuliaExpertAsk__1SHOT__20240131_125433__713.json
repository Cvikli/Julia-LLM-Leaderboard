It takes two arguments: `io::IO`, which represents the output stream, and `fwu::FloatWithUnits`, which is the object we want to print.\n\nInside this function, we use a string interpolation `$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)` to concatenate the value and unit with a space in between. The `print` function then writes these values directly to `io`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,208],"elapsed":3.590668383,"_type":"aimessage"}]
