The first argument `io` is the output stream where the object will be printed. The second argument `fwu` is your struct instance. Inside the function, we simply print the value and unit of the struct separated by a space.\n\nYou can use this method like:\n```julia\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,211],"elapsed":3.636871178,"_type":"aimessage"}]
