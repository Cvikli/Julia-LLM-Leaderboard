Here is how you could do it:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T<:Real}\n    value::T\n    unit::String\nend\n\nBase.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits) = print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\n```\n\nIn this code, `FloatWithUnits{T<:Real}` defines a new struct called `FloatWithUnits` that can hold any real number (`T<:Real`). The `Base.show` function is then defined to print the value and unit in the desired format.\n\nYou can test this with your example like so:\n\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,226],"elapsed":3.905422746,"_type":"aimessage"}]
