We then implement a `show` function that takes an IO stream (which is any output device in Julia) and a `FloatWithUnits` object. Inside this function, we use string interpolation to print the value and unit of the `FloatWithUnits` object.\n\nYou can test it with:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,209],"elapsed":3.610701863,"_type":"aimessage"}]
