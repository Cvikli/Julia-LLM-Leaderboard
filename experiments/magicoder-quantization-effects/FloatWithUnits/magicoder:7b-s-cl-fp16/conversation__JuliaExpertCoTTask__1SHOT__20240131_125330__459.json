We also define a `show` function for the `FloatWithUnits` type. The `Base.show` function is a built-in Julia function that defines how types are printed to the console. In this case, we use it to print out our custom struct in the desired format: `<value> <unit>`.","status":200,"tokens":[230,175],"elapsed":16.670170359,"_type":"aimessage"}]
