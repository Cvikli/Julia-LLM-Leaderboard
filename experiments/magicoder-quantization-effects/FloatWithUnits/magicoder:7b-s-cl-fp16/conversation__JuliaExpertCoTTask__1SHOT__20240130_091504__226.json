Then you define your fields `value::T` and `unit::String`. \n\nThe `Base.show(io::IO, x::FloatWithUnits) = print(io, \"$(x.value) $(x.unit)\")` function is the show method for your `FloatWithUnits` struct. This function takes in two parameters: `io::IO`, which represents the output stream where we want to print our object to, and `x::FloatWithUnits`, which is the FloatWithUnits object that we want to display.\n\nThe `print(io, \"$(x.value) $(x.unit)\")` prints out the value and unit of your struct in a string format with a space between them, which fits the problem statement requirement of having the value and unit separated by a space.","status":200,"tokens":[230,300],"elapsed":9.818978693,"_type":"aimessage"}]
