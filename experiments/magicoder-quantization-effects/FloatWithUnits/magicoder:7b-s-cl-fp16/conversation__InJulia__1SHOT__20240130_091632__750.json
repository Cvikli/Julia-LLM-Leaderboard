The `show` function is defined to take an I/O stream (`io`) and a FloatWithUnits instance (`fwu`). It then prints the value and unit fields of `fwu`, separated by a space.\n\nHere's how you can use this struct:\n```julia\njulia> f = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,225],"elapsed":3.897914694,"_type":"aimessage"}]
