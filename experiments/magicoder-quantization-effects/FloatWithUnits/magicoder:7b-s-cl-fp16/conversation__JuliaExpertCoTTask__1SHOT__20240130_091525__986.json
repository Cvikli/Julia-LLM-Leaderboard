We then implement the `show` function to output the value and unit in the specified format. The `Base.show` function is a built-in method for pretty-printing objects in Julia, so we override it to provide our custom behavior.","status":200,"tokens":[0,140],"elapsed":2.435709853,"_type":"aimessage"}]
