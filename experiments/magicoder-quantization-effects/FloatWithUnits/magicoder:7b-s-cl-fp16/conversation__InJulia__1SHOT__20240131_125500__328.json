The `show` function is then defined to take an IO stream (such as the standard output) and a FloatWithUnits object (`fwu`). It prints out the value and unit separated by a space.\n\nYou can use this struct like so:\n```julia\nx = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nshow(stdout, x) # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,205],"elapsed":3.530007724,"_type":"aimessage"}]
