It also defines a show method for printing the object in a human-readable format. Inside the show function, it writes the value to the IO stream with `write(io, string(f.value))`. Then it writes a space (\" \") to separate the value from the unit. Finally, it writes the unit to the IO stream with `write(io, f.unit)`.","status":200,"tokens":[105,213],"elapsed":3.737721657,"_type":"aimessage"}]
