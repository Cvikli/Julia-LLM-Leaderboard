We also implement the `show` function for it. The `Base.show` function is used to print the value of an object in Julia. \n\nThe `io::IO` parameter represents the output stream, which can be a terminal or a file. The `fwu::FloatWithUnits` parameter represents the object that you want to display.\n\nInside the function, we use string interpolation (`\"$variable\"`) to print both the value and unit of the `FloatWithUnits` object. The `print` function is used to write the output to the stream.","status":200,"tokens":[0,242],"elapsed":4.171145597,"_type":"aimessage"}]
