It has two fields: `value`, which is of type `Float64` and `unit`, which is of type `String`. \n\nThen we define a function `Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)` that takes an I/O stream and an instance of `FloatWithUnits` as arguments. Inside this function, it uses the built-in Julia method `print` to print the value and unit into the given IO stream separated by a space.","status":200,"tokens":[0,211],"elapsed":3.701661969,"_type":"aimessage"}]
