The `show` function will be called whenever we try to print an object of type FloatWithUnits.\n\nThe `Base.show` method is a built-in Julia function that controls how objects are printed. In this case, it takes as arguments an IO stream and an object of type FloatWithUnits. It then prints the value and unit of measurement in the format \"value unit\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,199],"elapsed":3.43676715,"_type":"aimessage"}]
