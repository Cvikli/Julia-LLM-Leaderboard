This way, we can ensure that our `FloatWithUnits` struct works with both floating point numbers (like 1.8) and integers (like 5).\n\nThe `Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)` function is the method that gets called when you print a `FloatWithUnits` object to the console. It takes two arguments: an I/O stream (`io`) and a `FloatWithUnits` object (`fwu`).\n\nInside this function, we use Julia's string interpolation to print out the value and unit of our `FloatWithUnits` object in the format \"value unit\". The `$(fwu.value)` part is replaced with the actual value of `fwu.value`, and the same goes for `fwu.unit`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,297],"elapsed":5.116955267,"_type":"aimessage"}]
