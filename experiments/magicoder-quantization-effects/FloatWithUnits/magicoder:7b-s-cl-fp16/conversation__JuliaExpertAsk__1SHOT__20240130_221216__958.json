We then implement the `show` function for this type which prints the value and unit in the format \"value unit\". The `Base.show` function is a built-in Julia function that is used to print an object in a human-readable way.","status":200,"tokens":[0,167],"elapsed":2.877492499,"_type":"aimessage"}]
