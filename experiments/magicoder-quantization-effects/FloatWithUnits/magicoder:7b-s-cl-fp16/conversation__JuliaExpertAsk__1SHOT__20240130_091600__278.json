The first argument `io` is the output stream where the string representation of your object will be written. The second argument is the object itself (`u::FloatWithUnits`).\n\nInside the function, we call `print(io, \"$(u.value) $(u.unit)\")`. Here, `$(...)`, string interpolation, is used to concatenate the value and unit with a space between them. `show` does not automatically print a newline at the end of output, so you don't need to worry about that.","status":200,"tokens":[0,233],"elapsed":4.101703829,"_type":"aimessage"}]
