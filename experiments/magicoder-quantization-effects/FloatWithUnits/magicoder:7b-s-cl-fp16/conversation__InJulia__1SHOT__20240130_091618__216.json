We also use string interpolation (`\"$(x.value) $(x.unit)\"`) to concatenate the value and unit with a space between them. The `IO` and `FloatWithUnits` types are part of Julia's standard library, so you don't need to define them yourself.\n\nYou can then use this struct like this:\n```julia\nx = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(x)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[74,223],"elapsed":3.871104212,"_type":"aimessage"}]
