The first argument is the IO stream where you want to print your object (typically the standard output), and the second argument is the object itself (`fwu::FloatWithUnits`). \n\nIn this case, we define `show` for our `FloatWithUnits` type. Inside the function, we use string interpolation `$(...)` to concatenate the value and unit with a space between them. The `print(io, ...)` function is used to print the result on the IO stream. \n\nYou can test this by creating an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and printing it:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu) # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[74,272],"elapsed":4.689772618,"_type":"aimessage"}]
