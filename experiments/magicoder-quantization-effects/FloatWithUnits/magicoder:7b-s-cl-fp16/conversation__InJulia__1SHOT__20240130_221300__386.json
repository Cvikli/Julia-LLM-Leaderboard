Here is how you might do it:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T}\n    value::T\n    unit::String\nend\n\n# Generate a show method for each possible type of T\nfor T in (Int, Float64)\n    @eval begin\n        function Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits{$T})\n            print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis code defines a `FloatWithUnits` struct that can hold either an integer or floating-point value and a string for the unit of measurement. It then uses `@eval` to generate a `show` method for each possible type of T, which is used to print out the value and unit in a formatted string.\n\nYou can use it like this:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,252],"elapsed":4.2838758,"_type":"aimessage"}]
