Here is how you could do it:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T<:Real}\n    value::T\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\nend\n```\nIn the above code, `Base.show` is a built-in function in Julia that is responsible for displaying objects to the console. The second argument `io::IO` specifies the output stream (usually standard output), and `fwu::FloatWithUnits` specifies the object of type `FloatWithUnits`.\n\nNow, when you print a `FloatWithUnits` instance like this:\n```julia\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(f)\n```\nIt will display \"1.8 meters\" as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[0,242],"elapsed":4.182934911,"_type":"aimessage"}]
