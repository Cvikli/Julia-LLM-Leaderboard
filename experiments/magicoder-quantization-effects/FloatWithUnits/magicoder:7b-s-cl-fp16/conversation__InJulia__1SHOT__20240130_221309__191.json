Here we define it for `FloatWithUnits` objects. The method takes two arguments: `io::IO`, which represents the output stream (usually the console), and `fwu::FloatWithUnits`, which is the object that we want to print.\n\nInside the function, we use `print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)` to print the value and unit of the FloatWithUnits object to the console. The `print` function writes a string directly to the output stream without adding any extra whitespace or newline characters at the end.\n\nNow you can create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and print it:\n\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,303],"elapsed":5.214228994,"_type":"aimessage"}]
