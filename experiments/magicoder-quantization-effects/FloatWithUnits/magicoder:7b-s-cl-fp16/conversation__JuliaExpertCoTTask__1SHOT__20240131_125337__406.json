We then implement the `show` function for our struct, which will print out the value followed by a space and then the unit. This allows us to create instances of FloatWithUnits and have them be printed in the desired format.","status":200,"tokens":[0,167],"elapsed":2.891969936,"_type":"aimessage"}]
