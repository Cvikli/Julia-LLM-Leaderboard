The function `Base.show()` defines how the object of type `FloatWithUnits` will be displayed. This function accepts an IO stream (like standard output in the console) and an instance of `FloatWithUnits` (`fwu` here). Then it simply prints out the value and unit separated by a space. \n\nYou can then use this struct as follows:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nshow(stdout, fwu) # Outputs: \"1.8 meters\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,230],"elapsed":2.274666404,"_type":"aimessage"}]
