The `show` function is defined to take an IO stream (`io`) and a `FloatWithUnits` object (`fwu`). It then prints out the value and unit in the format \"value unit\".\n\nYou can use this `show` method like this:\n\n```julia\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,203],"elapsed":1.923535888,"_type":"aimessage"}]
