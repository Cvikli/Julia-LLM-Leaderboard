It takes two arguments: `io`, which is the output stream where you want to write your string, and `f::FloatWithUnits`, which is the object that you are printing. The function simply concatenates the value and unit with a space and writes it to `io`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,150],"elapsed":1.418669785,"_type":"aimessage"}]
