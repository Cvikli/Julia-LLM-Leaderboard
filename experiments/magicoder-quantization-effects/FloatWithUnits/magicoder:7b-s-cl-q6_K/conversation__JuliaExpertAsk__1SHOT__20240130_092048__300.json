We then write a method for the `show` function to print out these values in the desired format. The `Base.show` function is used here as it's a built-in Julia function that allows us to customize how our types are printed. \n\nFor example, if you had an instance of `FloatWithUnits`, say `f = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")`, then calling `show(stdout, f)` would print out:\n\n```julia\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,226],"elapsed":2.197822749,"_type":"aimessage"}]
