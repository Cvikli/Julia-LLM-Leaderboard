It also defines a function that will print the value and unit in the desired format when called on an instance of `FloatWithUnits`.\n\nNow, let's test this out with your provided example:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,214],"elapsed":2.059089794,"_type":"aimessage"}]
