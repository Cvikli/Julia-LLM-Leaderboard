The first argument `io::IO` is the output stream where you want to write your string, and `x::FloatWithUnits` is the instance of `FloatWithUnits` that you want to print.\n\nThe `print(io, \"$(x.value) $(x.unit)\") = print(io, \"$(x.value) $(x.unit)\")` line does the actual printing. Here `$(...)`, called \"string interpolation\", is used to include the values of variables inside a string. The value and unit are included in the string with spaces between them.\n\nTo use this `show` method, you can create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` like so:\n```julia\nx = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(x)  # prints: \"1.8 meters\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,298],"elapsed":2.85374441,"_type":"aimessage"}]
