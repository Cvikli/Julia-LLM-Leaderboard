The first argument is the IO stream where you want to write your output and the second one is the object you want to display. In our case, we defined it for the `FloatWithUnits` struct so that when we call `println(float_with_units)`, it prints the value and unit of the float with units in the console.\n\nThe code creates a new struct FloatWithUnits with two fields: value which can be any numeric type, and unit which is a string representing the unit of the value.\n\nThen we define `Base.show` function for this struct. This function gets called whenever you print an object of this struct to console using `println`. Inside this method, we use `print` to display the formatted text on the IO stream. Here `\"$(x.value) $(x.unit)\"` is a string interpolation which will concatenate the value and unit with a space in between.\n\nFinally, we create an instance of FloatWithUnits named float_with_units and print it using `println`. This should output: 1.8 meters as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[0,379],"elapsed":3.697809922,"_type":"aimessage"}]
