Here's how you can do it:\n```julia\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\nend\n```\nHere `Base.show` is a function that takes in two arguments - an I/O stream and an object of type `FloatWithUnits`. The function then prints the value and unit to the I/O stream. \n\nYou can test your code with your provided example:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu) # This should output: 1.8 meters\n```\nThis will print out the `FloatWithUnits` object as a string that includes value and unit.","status":200,"tokens":[230,244],"elapsed":4.446919872,"_type":"aimessage"}]
