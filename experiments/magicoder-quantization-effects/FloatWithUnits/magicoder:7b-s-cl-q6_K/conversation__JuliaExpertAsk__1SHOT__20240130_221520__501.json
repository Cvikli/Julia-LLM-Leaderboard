The `show` function is defined to print out the value and unit in the desired format.\n\nYou can then create an instance of FloatWithUnits and print it:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,220],"elapsed":2.086875193,"_type":"aimessage"}]
