We also define a function `show` that takes an IO stream (which is what gets printed to the console when you print something) and a FloatWithUnits object. Inside the function, we simply print out the value and unit of the FloatWithUnits object separated by a space.\n\nNow let's test this with your given data:\n```julia\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(f)  # Output: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,217],"elapsed":2.070441642,"_type":"aimessage"}]
