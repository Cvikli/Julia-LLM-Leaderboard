The first argument is the IO stream where the output should be printed (like stdout or stderr), and the second argument is the object itself. In our case, we're defining it for `FloatWithUnits`.\n\nThe `print` function writes its arguments to the given IO stream. So in this case, we are printing out a string that consists of the value and unit fields of the FloatWithUnits struct. The `$(fwu.value)` syntax is used for string interpolation where variables inside `$()` are replaced by their values.\n\nYou can then create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` like this:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,278],"elapsed":2.63475163,"_type":"aimessage"}]
