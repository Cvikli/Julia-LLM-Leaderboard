It then prints the value and unit of the FloatWithUnits object to the provided I/O stream. The `$(fwu.value)` syntax is used for string interpolation, which inserts the value of fwu.value into the string.\n\nYou can use this `show` method like this:\n```julia\njulia> f = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,204],"elapsed":1.93262638,"_type":"aimessage"}]
