Here is how to do it:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T<:Real}\n    value::T\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, u::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(u.value) $(u.unit)\")\nend\n```\nHere we defined a new `struct` FloatWithUnits that consists of a real value and a string representing the unit.\n\nThen we overloaded the built-in function `Base.show` for `FloatWithUnits`. This method takes an input/output stream (IO) and a FloatWithUnits object, it concatenates the value and unit with a space and prints it to the IO stream.\n\nNow if you create a `FloatWithUnits` object and call `show`, it will display its value and unit in the format you specified:\n```julia\nu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nshow(STDOUT, u) # prints: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,249],"elapsed":2.424214223,"_type":"aimessage"}]
