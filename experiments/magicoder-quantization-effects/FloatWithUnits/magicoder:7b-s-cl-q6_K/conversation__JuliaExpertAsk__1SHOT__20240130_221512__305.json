It then prints the value and unit to the provided IO stream. The `print` function is used instead of `println` to avoid adding a newline at the end of the output.\n\nYou can use this method like so:\n```julia\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nshow(stdout, f) # prints \"1.8 meters\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,196],"elapsed":1.856957186,"_type":"aimessage"}]
