Then, we implement the function `Base.show`, which is used to display an instance of your type in the REPL or other I/O contexts. In our implementation, we simply print the value followed by a space and then the unit. \n\nLet's test our code with the example data:\n```julia\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(f) # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```\nAs expected, this will print \"1.8 meters\" to the console.","status":200,"tokens":[0,227],"elapsed":2.220169765,"_type":"aimessage"}]
