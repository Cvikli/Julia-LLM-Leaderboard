The function takes two arguments: `io`, which is the output stream where the result will be printed (usually the standard output), and `fwu`, which is the instance of `FloatWithUnits` that we want to display.\n\nInside the function, it uses the `print` function to print the value and unit of the `FloatWithUnits` object. The `print` function is a simple way in Julia to write data to an output stream without adding any extra whitespace or newline characters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,223],"elapsed":2.110247827,"_type":"aimessage"}]
