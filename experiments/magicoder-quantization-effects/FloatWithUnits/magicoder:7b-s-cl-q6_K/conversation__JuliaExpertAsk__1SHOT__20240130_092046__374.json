The first argument is the IO object that you want to write your output to (for example, the standard output). The second argument is the object that you want to display. In our case, it's an instance of FloatWithUnits.\n\nThe `@time` macro in Julia measures how long a block of code takes to run. It prints both the elapsed time and the result of the computation.\n\nSo when you create an instance of FloatWithUnits and print it using `show`, it will display its value and unit as a string, like \"1.8 meters\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,229],"elapsed":2.215456687,"_type":"aimessage"}]
