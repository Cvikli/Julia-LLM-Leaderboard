Here, we're defining a custom method for the `show` function of `FloatWithUnits`, which will concatenate the value and unit with a space. \n\nYou can call this `show` method by using the built-in function `print(f::FloatWithUnits)`. It will print the formatted string \"1.8 meters\" for an instance `f = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,207],"elapsed":1.591073117,"_type":"aimessage"}]
