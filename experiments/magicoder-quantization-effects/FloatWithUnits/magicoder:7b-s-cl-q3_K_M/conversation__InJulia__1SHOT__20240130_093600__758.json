The function `Base.show(io::IO, x::FloatWithUnits)` is written to print the value and unit of a FloatWithUnits object in the form \"value unit\".\n\nNow let's test our code:\n\n```julia\nf = FloatWithUnits{Float64}(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(f)  # Outputs: \"1.8 meters\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,249],"elapsed":1.909298233,"_type":"aimessage"}]
