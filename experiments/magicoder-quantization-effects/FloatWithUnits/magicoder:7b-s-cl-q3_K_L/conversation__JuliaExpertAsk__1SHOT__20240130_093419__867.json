The `show` function is defined to take an IO object (`io`) and a FloatWithUnits object(`wu`). It prints the value followed by a space and then the unit of the FloatWithUnits object.\n\nYou can use this show method as follows:\n\n```julia\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprint(f)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,219],"elapsed":1.755695127,"_type":"aimessage"}]
