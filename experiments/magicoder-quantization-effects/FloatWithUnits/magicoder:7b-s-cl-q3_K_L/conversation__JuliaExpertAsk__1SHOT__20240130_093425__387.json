The arguments are `io::IO` (the IO stream where the result should be printed), and `x::FloatWithUnits` (the instance of `FloatWithUnits` that you want to print). It simply prints the value and unit separated by a space.\n\nTo use this code, you would define your struct like so:\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n```\nAnd then create an instance of `FloatWithUnits`:\n```julia\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n```\nWhen you print `f` like this:\n```julia\nprintln(f)\n```\nThe output will be: \n```bash\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,245],"elapsed":1.957988856,"_type":"aimessage"}]
