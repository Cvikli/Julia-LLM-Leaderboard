This struct has two fields, `value` of type T (any real number), and `unit`, which is a string representing the unit of measure.\n\nNext, we define a `show` method for our `FloatWithUnits` object. The `Base.show` function takes two arguments: `io::IO` (the output IO stream) and `x::FloatWithUnits`. Inside the method, we print the value and unit of measure of x separated by a space.\n\nFinally, we create an instance `f` of our struct and print it to check if our `show` method works correctly: it should print \"1.8 meters\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,269],"elapsed":2.162584355,"_type":"aimessage"}]
