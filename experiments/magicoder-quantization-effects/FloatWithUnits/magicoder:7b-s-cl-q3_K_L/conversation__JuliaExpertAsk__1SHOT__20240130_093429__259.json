The `show` function is defined in the `Base` module, which provides automatic printing for all types. We override the default behaviour with our own version, which prints the value and unit of a `FloatWithUnits` object directly to an `IO` stream (in this case, the standard output).\n\nWe can then test this by creating an instance of `FloatWithUnits`, and calling `println()` on it. The result should be \"1.8 meters\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,258],"elapsed":2.099263985,"_type":"aimessage"}]
