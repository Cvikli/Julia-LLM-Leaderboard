This struct takes two parameters: `T` and `String`. `T` is used as the type parameter for `value` and it could be any numeric type like `Int`, `Float64`, etc. The `unit` field is also of type `String`.\n\nThen we define a function called `Base.show`. This function is a built-in function in Julia, which prints an object. Our custom `show` method for `FloatWithUnits` struct takes two arguments: `io::IO`, the IO stream where to print and `fwu::FloatWithUnits`, our struct's instance. Inside this function we use `print` function to concatenate the value and unit with a space, which is then printed on the provided IO stream.\n\nNow you can create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` using your data like:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nshow(stdout, fwu)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,316],"elapsed":2.5491908,"_type":"aimessage"}]
