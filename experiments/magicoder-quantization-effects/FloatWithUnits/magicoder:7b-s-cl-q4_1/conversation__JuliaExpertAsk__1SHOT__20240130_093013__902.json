The `show` method is then defined to take an IO stream and an instance of the FloatWithUnits type (`x::FloatWithUnits`), and it prints out the value and unit in the format \"$value $unit\".\n\nYou can use this struct like so:\n```julia\njulia> f = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,232],"elapsed":1.858707829,"_type":"aimessage"}]
