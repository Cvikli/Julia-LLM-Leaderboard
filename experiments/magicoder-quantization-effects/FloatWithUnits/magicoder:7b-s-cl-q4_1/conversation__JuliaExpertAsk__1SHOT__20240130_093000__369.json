Then, we define a function called `Base.show`. This function is special in that it provides the ability to customize how any given object of type FloatWithUnits prints to the console.\n\nThe `show` function takes two arguments: an I/O stream (usually standard output) and the FloatWithUnits instance we are showing. Inside this function, we simply print the value and unit of our FloatWithUnits instance on the given IO stream.","status":200,"tokens":[0,227],"elapsed":1.812715984,"_type":"aimessage"}]
