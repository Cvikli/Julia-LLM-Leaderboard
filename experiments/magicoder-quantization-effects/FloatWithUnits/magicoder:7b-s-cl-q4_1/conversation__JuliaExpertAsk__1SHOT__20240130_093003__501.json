The `io::IO` parameter specifies the output stream (which we don't use here), and `x::FloatWithUnits` is the instance of our `FloatWithUnits` struct that we want to print.\n\nIn the implementation, we simply call `print(io, \"$(x.value) $(x.unit)\")`, which will correctly format the value and unit into a string and then print it to the output stream. The `$(...)`, known as interpolation, is used to insert variables inside strings in Julia. \n\nTo use this function, you can create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` like so:\n```julia\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(f) # prints \"1.8 meters\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,271],"elapsed":2.171396539,"_type":"aimessage"}]
