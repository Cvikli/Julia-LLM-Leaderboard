Inside this function we use `print` to output the value and unit of our struct in a human-readable format. \n\nThis solution assumes you have already defined a FloatWithUnits type with a constructor that takes a value and a string specifying the unit, which is not provided in your task description. If such a definition was already given, this task would be solved by simply calling `show` on an instance of `FloatWithUnits`. \n\nHere's how to use it:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprint(fwu)\n```\nThis will output: `1.8 meters`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,246],"elapsed":1.938401197,"_type":"aimessage"}]
