The function `Base.show` is used to print out an instance of this struct in a formatted way. It concatenates the value and unit with a space between them and prints it out.\n\nFor example: \n```julia\njulia> f = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,207],"elapsed":1.676444106,"_type":"aimessage"}]
