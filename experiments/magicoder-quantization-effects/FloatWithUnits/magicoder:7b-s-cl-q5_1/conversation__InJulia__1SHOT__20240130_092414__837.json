Here is how you could do it:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits \n    value::Float64\n    unit::String \nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, f::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, f.value, \" \", f.unit)\nend\n```\nThis `show` method takes in an I/O stream (`io`) and the object to be printed (`f`), and it prints out the value of the `FloatWithUnits` struct followed by a space and then the unit string. This will print out the value and unit like \"1.8 meters\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,161],"elapsed":1.434376331,"_type":"aimessage"}]
