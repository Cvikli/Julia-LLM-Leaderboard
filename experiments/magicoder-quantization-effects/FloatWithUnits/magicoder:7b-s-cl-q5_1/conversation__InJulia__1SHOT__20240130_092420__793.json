Here's how it can be done:\n\n```julia\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    @printf(\"%.1f %s\", fwu.value, fwu.unit)\nend\n```\nThis `Base.show` method will print the value and unit of your struct in a human-readable format to any IO stream (such as `stdout`, a file, or even `IOBuffer`). The \"%.1f %s\" is a format string that says \"print out a floating point number with 1 decimal place (`%.1f`), then a space (` `), and finally the unit string (`%s`)\".\n\nYou can test this method like so:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu) # prints \"1.8 meters\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,280],"elapsed":2.54361497,"_type":"aimessage"}]
