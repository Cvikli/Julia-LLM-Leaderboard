The `Base.show` function is then called with an IO object (`io::IO`) and the FloatWithUnits instance (`x::FloatWithUnits`).\n\nInside this function, we convert the value and unit to strings using the `string` function, concatenate them with a space in between, and finally print it out. \n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nshow(STDOUT, f) # prints \"1.8 meters\" to the console\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,291],"elapsed":2.633111959,"_type":"aimessage"}]
