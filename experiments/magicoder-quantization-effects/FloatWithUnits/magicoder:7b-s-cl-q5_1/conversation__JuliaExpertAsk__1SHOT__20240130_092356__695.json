The function `show` then overloads the built-in `show` function in Julia, which allows customization of how your objects are printed when you use print statements or similar functions. \n\nInside this method, we firstly get the IO stream (the place where data is written), and a FloatWithUnits object `u`. We then print to this IO stream the value of the `value` field followed by a space and the unit in parenthesis.\n\nYou can use it as follows:\n```julia\nunit = \"meters\"\nf1 = FloatWithUnits(1.8, unit)\nprintln(f1) # This will print \"1.8 meters\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,287],"elapsed":2.596458883,"_type":"aimessage"}]
