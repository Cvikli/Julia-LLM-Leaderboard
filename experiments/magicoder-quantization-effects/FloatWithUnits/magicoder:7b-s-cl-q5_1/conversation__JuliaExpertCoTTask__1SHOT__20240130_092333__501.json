For this particular task, we are creating a custom show method for FloatWithUnits. \n\nIn the code above, `io::IO` indicates the stream where output will be written (in this case, it's the console), `fwu::FloatWithUnits` is the object to be displayed and printed, and `print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")` is the actual print statement that formats and writes out your `FloatWithUnits` object as \"1.8 meters\". \n\nIf you were to create a new FloatWithUnits object with a value of 2.0 and unit of \"meters\" and call `show()`, it would output: \"2.0 meters\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,267],"elapsed":2.426691343,"_type":"aimessage"}]
