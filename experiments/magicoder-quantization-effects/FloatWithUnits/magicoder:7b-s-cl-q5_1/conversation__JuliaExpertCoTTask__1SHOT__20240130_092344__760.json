The `show` function prints the value followed by a space and then the unit to the specified IO stream. If you want to test it, you can call it like this:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)\n```\nYou should see \"1.8 meters\" as output.","status":200,"tokens":[0,179],"elapsed":1.620300556,"_type":"aimessage"}]
