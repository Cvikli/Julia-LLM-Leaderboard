This type takes one parameterized field `F<:Real`, which means it can hold any real number.\n- The `Base.show` function is overloading the show function of Julia. It's defined to accept two arguments: an I/O stream (`io`) and a value of type `FloatWithUnits`.\n- Inside this function, we use the builtin `print` function to print both the `value` and `unit` fields. The `x.value` and `x.unit` syntax is used to access these fields.","status":200,"tokens":[0,218],"elapsed":1.974232131,"_type":"aimessage"}]
