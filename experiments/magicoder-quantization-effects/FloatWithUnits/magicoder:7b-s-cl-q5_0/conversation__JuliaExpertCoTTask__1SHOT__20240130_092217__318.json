We then implement a `show` function for this type. The `Base.show` function is built-in in Julia and it's responsible to print any object. In our case, it will be used to print instances of the `FloatWithUnits` struct.\n\nInside the `show` method, we use string interpolation (`$`) to format our output as a value followed by a space and the unit. This way, when an instance of `FloatWithUnits` is printed, it will appear in the specified format.","status":200,"tokens":[0,222],"elapsed":1.885574335,"_type":"aimessage"}]
