The first argument `io::IO` refers to the output stream where we want to write our string, and `x::FloatWithUnits` represents the object (in this case, it's an instance of FloatWithUnits). We then use `print` function to combine value and unit and print them. \n\nThe `println` at the end is used for testing your implementation. It will output: \"1.8 meters\".","status":200,"tokens":[74,240],"elapsed":2.066520523,"_type":"aimessage"}]
