We override it for our struct `FloatWithUnits`. This method takes two arguments, `io::IO` and `f::FloatWithUnits`, where `io::IO` stands for input/output stream. In this case `io` is usually your REPL or some other output you want to write the formatted string into.\n\nThe `print(io, \"$(f.value) $(f.unit)\") statement` will print the value and unit of the struct separated by a space. The `$()` syntax is used in Julia for string interpolation, which allows variables inside strings to be evaluated and printed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,271],"elapsed":2.320273252,"_type":"aimessage"}]
