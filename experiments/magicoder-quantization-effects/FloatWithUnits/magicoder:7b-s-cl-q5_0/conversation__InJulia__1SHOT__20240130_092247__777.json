Inside the struct, we have two fields: `value::F` and `unit::U`.\n\nThen, we define a function `Base.show(io::IO, x::FloatWithUnits)` that is invoked when Julia needs to print an instance of our struct. In this function, we use `print(io, \"$(x.value) $(x.unit)\")`, which prints out the value and unit separated by a space.","status":200,"tokens":[0,223],"elapsed":1.9029586,"_type":"aimessage"}]
