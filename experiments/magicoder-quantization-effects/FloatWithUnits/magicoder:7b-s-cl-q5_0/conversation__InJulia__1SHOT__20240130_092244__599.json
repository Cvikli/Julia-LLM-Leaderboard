The second argument (`fwu::FloatWithUnits`) is the instance of FloatWithUnits that you want to print.\n\nInside `Base.show`, we simply call Julia's built-in string interpolation (`$(...)`) feature and pass our `value` and `unit` fields, followed by a space.","status":200,"tokens":[0,255],"elapsed":2.177244283,"_type":"aimessage"}]
