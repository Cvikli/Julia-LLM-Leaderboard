To replace all spaces and hyphens with underscores you can use the `replace` method with a regular expression, replacing \" -\" or \" \"(whitespace) with \"_\". Here is an example of how you could write this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)\n    return replace(lowercase(col), r\"[ _-]+\" => \"_\")\nend\n``` \nThis function takes a string as input and returns the same string, but with leading, trailing, and any interior spaces or hyphens replaced by underscores. The `r\"[ _-]+\"` regular expression matches one or more consecutive spaces or hyphens.","status":200,"tokens":[0,169],"elapsed":1.526147944,"_type":"aimessage"}]
