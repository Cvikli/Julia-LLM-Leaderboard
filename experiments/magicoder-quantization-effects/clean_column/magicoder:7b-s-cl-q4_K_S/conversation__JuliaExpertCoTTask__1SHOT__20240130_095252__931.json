The regular expression `r\"[\\s-]\"` matches any whitespace character (`\\s`) and hyphens. The `replace()` function replaces these characters with underscores.\n\nWhen you run `clean_column(\"My Column\")`, it will return \"my_column\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,145],"elapsed":1.12964304,"_type":"aimessage"}]
