Here's how you might define such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)\n    return replace(lowercase(strip(col)), r\"[\\s|-]\" => \"_\")\nend\n```\nThis function first strips leading and trailing whitespaces from the column name, then converts it to lower case. Next, it replaces any spaces or hyphens in the cleaned string with underscores using the `replace` function. The regular expression `r\"[\\s|-]\"` matches either a space or a hyphen.","status":200,"tokens":[0,140],"elapsed":1.223125094,"_type":"aimessage"}]
