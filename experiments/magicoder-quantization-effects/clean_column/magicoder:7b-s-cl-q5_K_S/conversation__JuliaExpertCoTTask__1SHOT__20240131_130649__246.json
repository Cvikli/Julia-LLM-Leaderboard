The `replace` function is used with a regular expression (`r\"[\\s-]+\"`) that matches one or more spaces and hyphens, and replaces them with an underscore. This ensures that all spaces and hyphens are replaced by underscores.\n\nYou can test the function using your example:\n```julia\nprintln(clean_column(\"My Column\"))  # Outputs \"my_column\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,168],"elapsed":1.425334478,"_type":"aimessage"}]
