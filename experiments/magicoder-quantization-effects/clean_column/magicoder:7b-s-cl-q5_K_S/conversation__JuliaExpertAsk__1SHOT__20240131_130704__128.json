The `replace` function replaces all occurrences of a regular expression (specified in the second argument as `r\"[\\s-]+\"` which matches one or more whitespace characters and hyphens) with an underscore (`_`). The `lowercase` function converts the string to lower case, and `strip` removes any leading or trailing whitespace.","status":200,"tokens":[0,142],"elapsed":1.201150404,"_type":"aimessage"}]
