The `replace` function replaces all instances of a specified pattern with another value (e.g., replace spaces or hyphens with underscores). The `lowercase` function converts the string to lower case, the `strip` function removes leading and trailing white space characters, and the `r\"[-\\s]\" => \"_\"` is a regular expression pattern that matches either a hyphen or a whitespace character and replaces it with an underscore.","status":200,"tokens":[0,160],"elapsed":1.355137877,"_type":"aimessage"}]
