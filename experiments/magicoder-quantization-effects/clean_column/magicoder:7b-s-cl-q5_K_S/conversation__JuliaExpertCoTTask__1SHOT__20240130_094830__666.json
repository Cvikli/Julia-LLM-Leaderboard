Then, it uses the `lowercase` method to convert the column name to lower case. Finally, it uses another `replace` method to replace all remaining spaces with underscore. The resulting string is then returned by the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,152],"elapsed":1.301941615,"_type":"aimessage"}]
