The `replace` function is used for this purpose. It takes two arguments, a string to replace and a string or a character array (in which each element represents a possible substring of the original string) that needs to be replaced by another string. \n\nFor example, calling `clean_column(\"My Column\")` will return `\"my_column\"`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,156],"elapsed":1.158414319,"_type":"aimessage"}]
