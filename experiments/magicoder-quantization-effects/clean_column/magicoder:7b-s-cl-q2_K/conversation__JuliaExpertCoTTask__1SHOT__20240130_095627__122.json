Below is a sample function that performs the required operation:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col)\n    return replace(lowercase(strip(col)), \" \" => \"_\", \" -\" => \"_\")\nend\n\nclean_column(\"My Column\") # Output: \"my_column\"\n```\nIn this function, the `replace()` method is used to replace any spaces or hyphens in the string with underscores. The `lowercase()` method converts all characters to lower case, and the `strip()` function removes any leading or trailing whitespaces.","status":200,"tokens":[0,140],"elapsed":1.050985354,"_type":"aimessage"}]
