The function `clean_column` takes a string `col`, converts it to lower case and strips leading/trailing spaces using `lowercase` and `strip`. Then it replaces any sequence of one or more spaces or hyphens with an underscore.\n\nThe `replace` method is used with a regular expression (regex) that matches one or more space characters (`r\"[ -]+\"`), replacing them with an underscore (`_`). The result is printed out using `println`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,178],"elapsed":1.925635122,"_type":"aimessage"}]
