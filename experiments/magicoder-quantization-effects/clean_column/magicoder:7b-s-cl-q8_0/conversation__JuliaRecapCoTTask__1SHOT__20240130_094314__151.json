[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I would be glad to help you. Here is the solution using Julia programming language:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    return replace(lowercase(replace(strip(col), \" \", \"_\")), \"-\", \"_\")\nend\n```\n\nThe function `clean_column` takes a string input (argument `col`) and performs the following operations:\n1. Converts the entire string to lowercase using the `lowercase()` function. \n2. Replaces all spaces in the string with underscores using the `replace()` function, where the first argument is the target character(s) and the second argument is the replacement character(s).\n3. Strips leading and trailing whitespaces from the string using the `strip()` function. \n4. Finally, replaces any remaining hyphens with underscores.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input column name will be a String, as indicated by the type annotation `AbstractString`. If it can be anything else (like a Number or Symbol), you should adjust accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,237],"elapsed":2.724544312,"_type":"aimessage"}]
