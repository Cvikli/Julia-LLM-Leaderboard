This is done first, so that the other transformations (lowercasing and stripping white space) are performed on the cleaned string. The `lowercase` function is then used to convert all characters in a given string to lower case, and `strip` is used to remove any leading or trailing white space from the string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,212],"elapsed":2.432541581,"_type":"aimessage"}]
