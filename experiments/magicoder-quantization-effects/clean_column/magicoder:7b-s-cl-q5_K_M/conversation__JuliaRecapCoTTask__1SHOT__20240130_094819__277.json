[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is a function named `clean_column` that will clean column names according to the specifications given in your problem statement. It uses a number of built-in functions, including `lowercase`, `strip`, and `replace`.\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    return replace(strip(lowercase(col)), r\"[\\s\\-]+\" => \"_\")\nend\n```\nThis function will transform a string input into the desired output. However, if you want to use this with a DataFrame column names, here is how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::Symbol)\n    return replace(strip(lowercase(string(col))), r\"[\\s\\-]+\" => \"_\")\nend\n```\nThis function works on Symbols instead of strings. It converts the symbol to a string first, then applies the same logic. Note that the order of operations is different because symbols are immutable and hence cannot be manipulated directly (like changing case or replacing spaces). Therefore, they need to be converted to a string before these operations can take place.","status":200,"tokens":[0,246],"elapsed":2.200920089,"_type":"aimessage"}]
