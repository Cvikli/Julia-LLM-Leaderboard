[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nclean_column(\"My Column\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function that accomplishes this:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col)\n    return replace(lowercase(strip(col)), r\"[\\s-]\" => \"_\")\nend\n``` \n\nThis function takes a column name as input and returns the modified name following your specified rules. This can be tested using the provided data:\n\n```julia\nprintln(clean_column(\"My Column\")) # prints my_column\n```\n\nNote: `replace` method in Julia is used to replace matched patterns with another string. The first argument is a regular expression that matches any whitespace or hyphen characters (`r\"[\\s-]\"`) and replaces them with underscore (`\"_\"`). The second argument is the string that will replace these matched patterns, in this case `\"_\"`. \n\nThe `lowercase` function transforms all uppercase letters to lowercase. The `strip` function removes leading and trailing whitespaces from a string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,210],"elapsed":1.876246753,"_type":"aimessage"}]
