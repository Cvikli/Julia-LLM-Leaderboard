[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function that meets the requirements:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    col = lowercase(strip(col)) # convert to lowercase and remove leading/trailing whitespaces\n    replace(col, r\"[\\s-]+\" => \"_\") # replace any spaces or hyphens with underscores\nend\n```\nThe function `clean_column` takes in a string (`AbstractString`) as its argument. It converts the entire column name to lowercase and strips off leading and trailing whitespaces. Then it replaces all spaces and hyphens in the modified string with an underscore using regular expressions. The resultant cleaned string is then returned by the function.\n\nThis function should be able to handle any column name without throwing errors, as long as it's a `String` type. If special instructions are provided that alter this behavior, they can be implemented by adding additional conditions within the function or defining separate functions for specific cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,215],"elapsed":1.934996045,"_type":"aimessage"}]
