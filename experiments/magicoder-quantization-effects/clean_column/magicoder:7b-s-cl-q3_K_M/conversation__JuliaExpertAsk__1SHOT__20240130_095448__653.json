It then replaces all instances of spaces and hyphens with underscores using the `replace` function. The regular expression `r\"[ -]\"` is used to match space or hyphen characters.\n\nFor instance, calling `clean_column(\" My Column \")` will return `\"my_column\"`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,144],"elapsed":1.105801383,"_type":"aimessage"}]
