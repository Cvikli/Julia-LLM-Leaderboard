[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can use the `lowercase`, `strip` and `replace` functions from Base to solve this problem. Here is an example of how this could be implemented:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col)\n    return replace(lowercase(strip(col)), \" \" => \"_\")\nend\n```\nThis function takes a column name as input, converts it to lower case (to standardize the case), strips any leading or trailing white spaces, and replaces any space characters with underscore characters. The `replace` function from Base is used here for replacing substrings in strings.\n\nFor special instructions, you could modify this function:\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col)\n    return replace(lowercase(strip(col)), \" \" => \"_\")\nend\n```\nThis version of the function will perform as instructed, but it won't provide any benefit unless there is a specific requirement that needs to be met.","status":200,"tokens":[0,210],"elapsed":1.732702718,"_type":"aimessage"}]
