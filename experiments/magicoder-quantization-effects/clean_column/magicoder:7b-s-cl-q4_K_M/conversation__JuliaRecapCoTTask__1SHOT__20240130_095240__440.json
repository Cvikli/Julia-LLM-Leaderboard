[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is the function `clean_column` in Julia language:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    return replace(lowercase(strip(replace(col, \" \", \"_\"))), \"-\", \"_\")\nend\n```\nThis function takes a string `col` as input and returns the same string with lowercased letters, stripped leading and trailing whitespaces, replaced spaces and hyphens with underscores. \n\nYou can use this function by calling it with your column name like so:\n\n```julia\ncolumn_name = \"My Column\"\ncleaned_column = clean_column(column_name)\nprintln(cleaned_column) # Outputs: \"my_column\"\n```\n\nThe `replace` function replaces all occurrences of a certain character (in this case, space and hyphen with underscore), the `strip` function removes leading and trailing whitespaces, and the `lowercase` function converts all characters to lowercase. The resulting cleaned column name is then returned by the function. \n\nMake sure that you import your data into Julia correctly and pass in the correct column name string for this function to work properly. Also note that this code assumes the input column names are of type `AbstractString`, if they are not, you might need to convert them before passing them into the `clean_column` function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,306],"elapsed":2.510558775,"_type":"aimessage"}]
