Here's a simple function to do the job:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col)\n    return lowercase(replace(strip(col), \" \" => \"_\", \"-\" => \"_\"))\nend\n```\n\nYou can then call this function with your example data as follows:\n\n```julia\nprintln(clean_column(\"My Column\"))  # Outputs: my_column\n```\n\nThis should return the cleaned column name as expected. The `lowercase` function is used to convert all uppercase characters in a string into lowercase, and the `replace` function with its arguments `\" \" => \"_\", \"-\" => \"_\"` replaces any spaces or hyphens in the string with underscores. Finally, `strip(col)` removes leading and trailing whitespaces from the string `col`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,196],"elapsed":1.566001658,"_type":"aimessage"}]
