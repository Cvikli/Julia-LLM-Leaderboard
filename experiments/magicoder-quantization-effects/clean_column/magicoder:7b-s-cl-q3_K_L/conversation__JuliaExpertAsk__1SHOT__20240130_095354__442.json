Here is a sample code snippet:\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col)\n    return replace(lowercase(strip(col)), \" \" => \"_\") |> replace(\"-\" => \"_\")\nend\n```\nIn this example, the `clean_column` function takes in an argument `col`, which is the column name that you want to clean. The function first converts `col` to lowercase and strips any leading or trailing whitespaces using the `strip` and `lowercase` functions respectively. It then replaces all spaces with underscores using the `replace` function. Finally, it replaces any hyphens with underscores.","status":200,"tokens":[0,160],"elapsed":1.282665444,"_type":"aimessage"}]
