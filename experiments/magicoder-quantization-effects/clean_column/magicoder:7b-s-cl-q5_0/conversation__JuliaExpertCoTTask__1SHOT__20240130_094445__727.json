It first converts the input to lower case, then strips any leading or trailing whitespace with the `strip` function and replaces all spaces and hyphens with underscores with the `replace` function using a regular expression (`r\"[\\s-]\"`). The result is returned as output of the function.\n\nNow let's test this function with your provided data:\n```julia\nprintln(clean_column(\"My Column\"))  # Output: \"my_column\"\n```\nThis will return the expected output \"my_column\".","status":200,"tokens":[227,191],"elapsed":3.391544884,"_type":"aimessage"}]
