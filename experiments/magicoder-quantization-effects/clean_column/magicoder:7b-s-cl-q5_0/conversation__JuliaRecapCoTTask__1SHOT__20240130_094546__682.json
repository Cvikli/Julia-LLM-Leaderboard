[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple Julia function that fulfills the task:\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col)\n    return replace(lowercase(strip(col)), \" \" => \"_\", \"-\" => \"_\") \nend\n```\nThis function first removes leading and trailing whitespaces using `strip(col)`. Then it converts all characters to lower case using `lowercase(strip(col))`. The `replace` function replaces spaces (\" \") with underscores, and hyphens (\"-\") with underscores. This transformed name is then returned as the result of the function.\n\nIf there are specific instructions that need to be followed (like keeping only alphanumeric characters or replacing certain characters), those can be incorporated into the function as well. However, these changes would make the solution less general and more tailored to the specific problem at hand.","status":200,"tokens":[0,185],"elapsed":1.606384982,"_type":"aimessage"}]
