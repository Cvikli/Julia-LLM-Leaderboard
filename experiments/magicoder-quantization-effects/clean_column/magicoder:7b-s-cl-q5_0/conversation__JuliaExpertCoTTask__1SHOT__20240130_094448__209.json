It converts all characters in the string to lowercase using the `lowercase()` function.\n2. It replaces all spaces with underscores using the `replace()` function, replacing both \" \" (space) and \"-\" (hyphen).\n3. It strips any leading or trailing whitespaces using the `strip()` function.\n\nThe output of this function is the cleaned column name as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,257],"elapsed":2.208952023,"_type":"aimessage"}]
