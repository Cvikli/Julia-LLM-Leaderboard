[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia function `clean_column` that cleans a column name:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    return replace(replace(lowercase(strip(col)), \" \" => \"_\"), \"-\" => \"_\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works as follows:\n\n1. The `lowercase` function converts the input string to lower case, which ensures that the cleaning process is not case-sensitive.\n2. The `strip` function removes any leading or trailing whitespaces from the input string.\n3. Then, `replace(\" \" => \"_\")` replaces all spaces in the string with underscores, and `replace(\"-\" => \"_\")` does the same for hyphens. This ensures that no special characters will remain after cleaning.\n4. Finally, it returns the cleaned column name.","status":200,"tokens":[0,191],"elapsed":1.656708145,"_type":"aimessage"}]
