Here's how you can define the function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col)\n    return replace(replace(lowercase(col), ' ', '_'), '-', '_')\nend\n```\nThis `clean_column` function first converts all characters to lowercase using the `lowercase` function, and then replaces any spaces with underscores using the `replace` function. It also replaces hyphens with underscores. The `replace` function is called twice because the first replacement is for spaces, and the second one is for hyphens. \n\nYou can test this function by calling it:\n```julia\nprintln(clean_column(\"My Column\")) # prints \"my_column\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,167],"elapsed":1.353421933,"_type":"aimessage"}]
