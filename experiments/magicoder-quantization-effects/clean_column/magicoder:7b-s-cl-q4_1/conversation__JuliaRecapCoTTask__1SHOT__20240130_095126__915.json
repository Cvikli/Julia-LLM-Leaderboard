[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function that cleans the column name as specified:\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)\n    # Convert to lower case, strip leading and trailing whitespaces, replace spaces with underscore\n    return replace(lowercase(strip(col)), r\"[\\s-]\", \"_\")\nend\n```\nYou can use this function as follows:\n```julia\ncolumn_name = \"My Column\"\ncleaned_column_name = clean_column(column_name)\nprintln(\"Cleaned column name is : $cleaned_column_name\")\n```\nThe `replace` function replaces all occurrences of the regular expression `r\"[\\s-]\"` (which matches either a whitespace or a hyphen) with an underscore. The `lowercase` function converts the string to lower case, `strip` removes leading and trailing whitespaces, and finally `clean_column` returns this modified column name.\n\nRemember that in Julia, it's important to match your function argument types with the actual argument type you are passing into the function when calling it. In this case we pass a String into the function so our function argument is also a String.","status":200,"tokens":[11,261],"elapsed":2.144837071,"_type":"aimessage"}]
