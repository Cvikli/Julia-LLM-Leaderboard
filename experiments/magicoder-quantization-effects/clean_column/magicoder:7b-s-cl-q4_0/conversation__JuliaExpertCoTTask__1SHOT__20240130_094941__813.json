It first converts the string to lower case using the `lowercase` function. Then it replaces all spaces in the string with underscores using the `replace` function. The result is returned by the function. \n\nTo test the function, you can call it with a sample column name:\n```julia\nclean_column(\"My Column\")\n```\nThis will output `\"my_column\"`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,171],"elapsed":1.297009061,"_type":"aimessage"}]
