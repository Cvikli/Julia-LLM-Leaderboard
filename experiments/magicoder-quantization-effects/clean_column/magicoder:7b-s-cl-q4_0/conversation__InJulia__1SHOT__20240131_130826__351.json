The `lowercase` function is used to convert all characters in the string to lower case.\n2. The `strip` function is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespaces from the string.\n3. The `replace` function with ' ' (a space) as an argument replaces all spaces in the string with underscores.\n4. Finally, another replace function with '-' (a hyphen) as an argument replaces all hyphens in the string with underscores. \n\nThis function will return a cleaned version of your column name that is lowercase and has no leading or trailing spaces, with spaces and hyphens replaced by underscores.","status":200,"tokens":[0,238],"elapsed":1.770695922,"_type":"aimessage"}]
