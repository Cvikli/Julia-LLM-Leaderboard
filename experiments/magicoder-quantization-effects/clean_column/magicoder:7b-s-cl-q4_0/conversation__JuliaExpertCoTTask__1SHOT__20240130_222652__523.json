This is done by passing a regular expression (`r\"[\\s-]+\"`) that matches one or more whitespace characters (including space, tab, newline etc.) or hyphen to the `replace` function. The replacement string `\"_\"` is used as a placeholder for all matched patterns.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\nprintln(clean_column(\"My Column\"))  # Output: \"my_column\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,233],"elapsed":1.734339366,"_type":"aimessage"}]
