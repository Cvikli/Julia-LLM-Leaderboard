It converts the entire string into lowercase using the `lower()` method. This ensures that all characters are treated as lowercase, regardless of their original case (upper or lower).\n2. Then it replaces every space (' ') in the string with an underscore ('_') using the `replace()` method. \n3. Finally, it replaces every hyphen ('-') in the string with an underscore using another `replace()` method call.\n\nThese operations will result in a new string where spaces and hyphens have been replaced by underscores, and all other characters are lowercase.","status":200,"tokens":[0,212],"elapsed":3.71838998,"_type":"aimessage"}]
