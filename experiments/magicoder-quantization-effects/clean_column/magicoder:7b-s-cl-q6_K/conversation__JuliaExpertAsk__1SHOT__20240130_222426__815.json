The `replace()` function is used to replace all occurrences of one or more whitespace characters (including tabs) or hyphen with an underscore. The `strip()` function removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the string. The `lowercase()` function converts all uppercase letters in a string into lowercase.\n\nYou can test this function with:\n```julia\nprintln(clean_column(\"My Column\"))  # Outputs \"my_column\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,198],"elapsed":1.882382004,"_type":"aimessage"}]
