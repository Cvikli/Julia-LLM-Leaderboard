Here's how you would write the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col) \n    return replace(replace(lowercase(col), \" \" => \"_\"), \"-\" => \"_\")\nend\n```\n\nLet's test this with your example data,\n\n```julia\nprintln(clean_column(\"My Column\")) # Output: my_column\n```\n\nThis function works by first converting the column name to lowercase using `lowercase`, then replacing all spaces with underscores using `replace` with a substitution string of `\" \" => \"_\"`. The second `replace` call is used to replace any hyphens in the column name with underscores. The cleaned column name is then returned by the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,189],"elapsed":1.86999728,"_type":"aimessage"}]
