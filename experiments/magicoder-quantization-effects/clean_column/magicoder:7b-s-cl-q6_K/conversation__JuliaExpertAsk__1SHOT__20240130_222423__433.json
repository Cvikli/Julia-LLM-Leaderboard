The `replace()` function is used to replace the matches of the regular expression `r\"[\\s-]\"` (which matches any space or hyphen) with an underscore. The `strip()` function removes leading and trailing whitespaces from the string, and the `lowercase()` function converts all characters in the string to lower case.","status":200,"tokens":[0,156],"elapsed":1.477061181,"_type":"aimessage"}]
