Here is a possible implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    return replace(lowercase(strip(col)), \" \" => \"_\")\nend\n\nprintln(clean_column(\"My Column\")) # Outputs: my_column\n```\n\nThis function accepts a string `col` as input and returns the cleaned column name. The `replace` function is used to replace all spaces with underscores, the `lowercase` function converts the string to lower case, and the `strip` function is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespaces.","status":200,"tokens":[0,179],"elapsed":1.773762994,"_type":"aimessage"}]
