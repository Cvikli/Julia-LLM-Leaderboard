Here's a function to do exactly that:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)\n    return replace(lowercase(strip(col)), r\"[ _\\-]\" => \"_\")\nend\n```\nThis function first strips leading, trailing whitespaces from the string using `strip()`. Then it converts all characters to lower case using `lowercase()`. After that, it uses a regular expression to find and replace all spaces (\" \"), hyphens (\"-\"), and any number of leading or trailing underscores with a single underscore. The result is a cleaned column name. \n\nPlease note that the built-in string functions like `replace()`, `lowercase()` are part of standard library and hence don't need importing before using them in code. \n\nAlso, you can use the function by passing your column name as below:\n```julia\ncleaned_column = clean_column(\"My Column\")\nprintln(cleaned_column) # Outputs \"my_column\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[78,247],"elapsed":1.978628374,"_type":"aimessage"}]
