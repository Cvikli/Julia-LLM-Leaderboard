[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

If it's a `Date`, we throw an error because only `DateTime` objects are allowed. Otherwise, we increase the hour part of the `DateTime` by `bump` and return the new `DateTime`.\n\nYou can now test this function with your data:\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)\n```\nThis will output:\n```julia\n2023-04-10T15:00:00\n```","status":200,"tokens":[244,300],"elapsed":17.609031233,"_type":"aimessage"}]
