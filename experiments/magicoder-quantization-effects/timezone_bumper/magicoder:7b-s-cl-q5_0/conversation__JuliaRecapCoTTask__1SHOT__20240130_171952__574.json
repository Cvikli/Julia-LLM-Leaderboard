[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function in Julia that implements the above description:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump::Int=3)\n    # check if dt is Date type\n    if typeof(dt) == Date\n        error(\"Input must be a DateTime, not a Date.\")\n    end\n    \n    # increase the time by bump hours\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nThis function takes in an argument `dt` which is of type DateTime and an optional argument `bump`, which defaults to 3. It checks if `dt` is a Date, and if so, throws an error. Otherwise, it increases the time by `bump` hours using the `+` operator with `Hour(bump)`.\n\nYou can test this function with a specific date-time:\n```julia\njulia> timezone_bumper(DateTime(2021, 12, 25, 14))\n2021-12-25T17:00:00\n```\nIn this case, the function correctly increases the time by 3 hours.","status":200,"tokens":[0,264],"elapsed":2.310880564,"_type":"aimessage"}]
