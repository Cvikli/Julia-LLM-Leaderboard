It takes a DateTime object as input (`dt`) and an optional integer bump (defaults to 3). If no DateTime object is provided it returns the current time in UTC timezone. The function then adds the number of hours specified by `bump` to the DateTime object and returns the result.\n\nIf you try to pass a Date type, like below:\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(Date(2023, 4, 10)) # it will throw an error\n```\nYou'll get the following error message because Dates in Julia are not mutable and can't be directly incremented by hours (as you would do with DateTime).\n\n```julia\nERROR: MethodError: Cannot `convert` an object of type Date to an object of type Int64\nThis may have arisen from a call to the constructor DateTime or a field access.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,305],"elapsed":2.636768987,"_type":"aimessage"}]
