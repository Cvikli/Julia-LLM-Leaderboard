Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem in Julia by defining a function called `timezone_bumper`. This function takes two arguments: a datetime object (`dt`) and the amount of time (in hours) to add to the datetime (`bump`). If no value is provided for `bump`, it defaults to 3 hours.\n\nHere's an example implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)\n    if typeof(dt) != DateTime\n        error(\"Input must be of type DateTime.\")\n    end\n    \n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks whether the input `dt` is a DateTime object. If not, it throws an error. Then, it adds the number of hours specified by `bump` to the datetime and returns the result. \n\nRemember that you will need to import the Dates module in order to use the types and methods related to date and time manipulation. The function also assumes that your input is already in UTC timezone since DateTime type does not carry any timezone info.","status":200,"tokens":[0,244],"elapsed":2.087427151,"_type":"aimessage"}]
