Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can implement the `timezone_bumper` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump::Int=3)\n    dt += Hour(bump)\n    return dt\nend\n\n# test the function with a DateTime object\nd = DateTime(\"2019-07-04T12:00:00\")  # July 4, 2019 at 12:00:00 (noon) local time\nbumped_time = timezone_bumper(d)\nprintln(\"Bumped Time: \", bumped_time)\n```\nThis function works by adding `bump` hours to the given date-time. By default, it will add 3 hours if no value is provided for `bump`. This function checks that a DateTime object has been passed as an argument and does not work with Date objects. If a Date object is passed instead of a DateTime object, an error will be thrown.\n\nHere's how you could add an error handling part:\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump::Int=3)\n    try\n        dt += Hour(bump)\n        return dt\n    catch e\n        if isa(e, MethodError) || isa(e, ArgumentError)  # check for DateTime and Date types\n            error(\"Only DateTime type is allowed. You tried to pass a $(typeof(dt))\")\n        else\n            rethrow()\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\nThis version of the function will throw an error if a non-DateTime object is passed in, providing more detailed information about what went wrong.","status":200,"tokens":[0,386],"elapsed":3.311819197,"_type":"aimessage"}]
