Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you might implement this:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt=now(), bump::Int=3)\n    if isa(dt, DateTime)\n        return dt + Hour(bump)\n    elseif isa(dt, Date)\n        error(\"Date types are not supported. Only DateTime type is allowed.\")\n    else\n        error(\"Invalid input: only DateTime and Date types are allowed\")\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function checks if the provided argument `dt` is a DateTime or Date type using the `isa()` function. If `dt` is a DateTime, it adds bump hours to it and returns the result. \n\nIf `dt` is a Date instead of a DateTime, an error message is printed that says \"Date types are not supported. Only DateTime type is allowed.\"\n\nIf `dt` is neither a DateTime nor a Date, another error message is thrown saying \"Invalid input: only DateTime and Date types are allowed\". \n\nRemember to use the function like this:\n```julia\nbumped_time = timezone_bumper(now())\n```\nThis will return the current time bumped by three hours. You can also specify a different amount of bump hours or a specific DateTime like so:\n```julia\nspecific_time = DateTime(\"2023-01-01T14:30\")  # January 1, 2023, at 2:30 PM\nbumped_time = timezone_bumper(specific_time, 5)   # bump by 5 hours instead of default 3\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,368],"elapsed":3.1630945,"_type":"aimessage"}]
