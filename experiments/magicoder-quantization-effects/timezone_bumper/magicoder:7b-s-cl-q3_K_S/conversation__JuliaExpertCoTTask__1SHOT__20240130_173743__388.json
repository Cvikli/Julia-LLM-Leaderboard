Here's how you might define a function that does what is described:\n\n```julia\nusing TimeZones\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump=3)\n    if typeof(dt) == Date \n        error(\"Date type provided. Please use DateTime type\")\n    end\n    dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we first check whether the input is of `DateTime` type. If it's not, an error message will be printed. Then, we simply add a time duration equal to bump hours to the provided datetime and return the new, modified datetime. The `bump=3` argument means that if no explicit value is provided for bump, 3 will be used as default.\n\nYou can test this function with your given data like so:\n\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,249],"elapsed":1.966005982,"_type":"aimessage"}]
