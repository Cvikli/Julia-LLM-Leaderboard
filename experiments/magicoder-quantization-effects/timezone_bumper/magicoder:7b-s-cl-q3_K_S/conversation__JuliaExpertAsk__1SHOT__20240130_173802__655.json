Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is the Julia code that solves your problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Testing it\ndt = now()\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt)\nprint(bumped_dt)\n```\nPlease note that `now()` function returns the current date and time. If you want to pass a specific date, use `DateTime` instead. \n\nHere is how the function works:\n- The `timezone_bumper` function takes one argument, `dt`, of type `DateTime`. It also has an optional second argument, `bump`, which defaults to 3 if not provided.\n- The function increases the input timestamp by adding hours (specified by `bump`) using `+` operator and returns the new DateTime value.\n\nPlease make sure you have the Dates package installed in your Julia environment before executing this code, as it is used for time manipulation operations. If not, you can install it using Pkg mode with `]add Dates`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,251],"elapsed":1.977218827,"_type":"aimessage"}]
