You provided $dt which is of type $(typeof(dt)).\"))\n    end\n    \n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nIn this code, we first check if the input `dt` is of type `DateTime`. If it's not, throw an error stating that the provided argument needs to be a `DateTime` type.\n\nIf the input `dt` is of type `DateTime`, then add bump hours to the `DateTime`. The operation `Hour(bump)` represents the time difference we want to make to the original DateTime object. This function will work for all DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","status":200,"tokens":[0,202],"elapsed":1.645679065,"_type":"aimessage"}]
