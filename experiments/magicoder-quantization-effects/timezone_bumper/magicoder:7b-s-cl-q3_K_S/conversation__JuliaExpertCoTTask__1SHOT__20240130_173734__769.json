If `dt` is a `Date`, it throws an error because we are not allowed to bump timestamps using Date types. However, if `dt` is a `DateTime`, it adds the number of hours provided (defaulting to +3) and returns the new timestamp.\n\nYou can use the function with a DateTime type like this:\n\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3) #=> DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 15, 0)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[244,268],"elapsed":11.954555763,"_type":"aimessage"}]
