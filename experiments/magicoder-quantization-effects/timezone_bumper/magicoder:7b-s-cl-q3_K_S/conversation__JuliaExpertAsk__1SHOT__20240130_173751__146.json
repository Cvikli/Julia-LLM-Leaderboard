Consider adding an hour to a DateTime.\"))\n    else\n       dt+Hour(bump)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by default for current date and time (`now()`), but you can also pass your own `DateTime`. It then checks if the provided argument is of type `Date` or `DateTime`. If it's a `Date`, it throws an error. Otherwise, it increases the time by `bump` hours.\n\nNote: The `Hour(bump)` operation will increase the datetime object `dt` by the number of hours specified in `bump`.","status":200,"tokens":[103,193],"elapsed":1.536191935,"_type":"aimessage"}]
