If no value is passed in, the current time will be used as `dt`. If `dt` is of type `Date`, an error will be thrown.\n- The function checks whether `dt` is of type `DateTime` or not. If it's not, it converts it into `DateTime`.\n- Finally, it adds `bump*Hour()` (which represents adding the number of hours specified in `bump`) to `dt`, and returns the new time.","status":200,"tokens":[0,269],"elapsed":2.109625863,"_type":"aimessage"}]
