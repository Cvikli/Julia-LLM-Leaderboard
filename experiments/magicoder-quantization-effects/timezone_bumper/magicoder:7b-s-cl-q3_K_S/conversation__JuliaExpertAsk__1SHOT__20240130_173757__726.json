Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the code in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt; bump=3)\n    if typeof(dt) !== DateTime \n        throw(ErrorException(\"Only DateTime type is accepted.\"))\n    end\n    return dt+Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nIn this code, the function `timezone_bumper` takes a DateTime object and an optional parameter bump. If no value is provided for bump, it defaults to 3 hours. The function first checks if the input dt is of type DateTime using the `typeof` function. If not, it throws an error exception with the message \"Only DateTime type is accepted\". If the input is a valid DateTime, it adds the number of hours specified by the bump parameter and returns the new, bumped time.\n\nYou can test this function like so:\n```julia\ndt = Dates.now()  # current date/time\nbump = 2\nnew_time = timezone_bumper(dt; bump=bump)\nprintln(\"Original Time: $dt, Bumped Time: $new_time\")\n```\nYou'll see a message like this: \"Original Time: 2023-04-18T15:37:19.662, Bumped Time: 2023-04-18T18:37:19\". The original time is printed followed by the new time that's been bumped forward by `bump` hours.","status":200,"tokens":[0,347],"elapsed":2.723304722,"_type":"aimessage"}]
