If no argument is provided for the `bump`, it defaults to 3. It checks if the input `dt` is of type `Date`. If it is, an error message is returned. Otherwise, it increases `dt` by the number of hours specified in `bump` and returns the new `DateTime` object.\n\nYou can test this function with your example as follows:\n\n```julia\nprintln(timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)) # prints 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,245],"elapsed":1.931643033,"_type":"aimessage"}]
