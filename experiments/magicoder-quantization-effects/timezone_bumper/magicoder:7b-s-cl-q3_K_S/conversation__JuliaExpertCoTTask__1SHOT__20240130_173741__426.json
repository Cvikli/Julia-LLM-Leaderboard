[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem in Julia by creating a function that checks the type of the input and applies the bumping accordingly. Below is an example solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime=now(), bump::Int=3)\n    if typeof(dt) == Date\n        error(\"Date types are not supported, only DateTime.\")\n    else\n        return dt + Hour(bump)\n    end\nend\n```\nWith this function, calling `timezone_bumper()` will give you the current time plus three hours. You can specify a different datetime with the first argument or the number of hours to bump with the second argument. \n\nNote: The `Dates` module in Julia provides functionality for manipulating date and time data.","status":200,"tokens":[0,176],"elapsed":1.387771175,"_type":"aimessage"}]
