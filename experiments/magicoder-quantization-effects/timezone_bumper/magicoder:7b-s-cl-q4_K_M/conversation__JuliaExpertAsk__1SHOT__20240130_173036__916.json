The default value for `bump` is set to 3. \n\nIf you want to ensure that only DateTime objects are passed into this function, you can use a type assertions:\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump::Int = 3)\n    return dt + Second(60 * 60 * bump)\nend\n\n# Testing the function with a DateTime object\ndt = now()\nprintln(\"Time before bump: \", dt)\nnew_time = timezone_bumper(dt, 4) # Increase by 4 hours\nprintln(\"Time after bump: \", new_time)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,317],"elapsed":2.538649064,"_type":"aimessage"}]
