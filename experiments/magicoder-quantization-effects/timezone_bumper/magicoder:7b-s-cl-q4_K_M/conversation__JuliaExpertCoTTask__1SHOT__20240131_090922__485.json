If the input is not a `DateTime`, an error is thrown. Otherwise, the function returns the provided timestamp increased by `bump` hours. The default value of `bump` is set to 3.\n\nYou can test this function with your example:\n\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)\n```\nThis will return `2023-04-10T15:00:00` which is the timestamp increased by 3 hours.","status":200,"tokens":[0,240],"elapsed":1.954078762,"_type":"aimessage"}]
