[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date)\n    error(\"Input Date type is not accepted. Please provide DateTime.\")\nend\n```\n\nIn this snippet, the function `timezone_bumper` has two methods: one for `DateTime` and another for `Date`. If a `Date` is provided as input, an error message is thrown. By default, it adds 3 hours to the date-time but this can be changed with the optional `bump::Int=3` parameter.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(\"2021-07-01T14:56\")  # example timestamp\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt)   # bumps it by default of +3 hours (17:56 in this case)\n```\n\nPlease note that the function `timezone_bumper` will throw an error if you provide a Date object instead of DateTime. This is because adding hours to a Date doesn't make any sense, as a Date represents a date only. If you want to shift time from one day to another, you should use DateTime instead.","status":200,"tokens":[0,306],"elapsed":2.508670392,"_type":"aimessage"}]
