If it is, it adds the number of hours specified by the bump parameter to the datetime and returns the result.\n- If the provided argument is not a DateTime, but instead a Date (which is a subtype of DateTime), an error message is thrown.\n- If the provided argument is neither a DateTime nor a Date, another error message is thrown.","status":200,"tokens":[0,231],"elapsed":1.924109726,"_type":"aimessage"}]
