If the bump argument is not provided it will use 3 as the default value.\n- It then returns the DateTime object shifted by the number of hours specified in the bump argument.\n- The `timezone_bumper` function throws an error if a Date object is passed instead of a DateTime object, as the function only works with DateTime types.\n  \nYou can use this function like so: \n```julia\ndt = now() # get current date and time\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt) # bump the datetime by default 3 hours\nbumped_dt_2 = timezone_bumper(dt, 5) # bump the datetime by 5 hours\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,277],"elapsed":2.202822817,"_type":"aimessage"}]
