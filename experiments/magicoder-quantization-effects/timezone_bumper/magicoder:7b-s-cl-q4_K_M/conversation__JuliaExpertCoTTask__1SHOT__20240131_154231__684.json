It checks if the input is indeed a DateTime object, and throws an error if it's not. If no bump value was provided (i.e., only dt), it defaults to 3 hours. The function then adds the specified number of hours to the DateTime object and returns the result.\n\nNow let's test this function using your data:\n\n```julia\ntimezone_bumber(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)\n```\n\nThis should return `2023-04-10T15:00:00`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,232],"elapsed":1.857087516,"_type":"aimessage"}]
