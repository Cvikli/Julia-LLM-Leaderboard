If no second argument is provided, it uses the default value of 3. The function then adds this number of hours to the original date and time, returning the new date and time. This is then printed out.\n\nIf a `Date` object is passed instead, the function will throw an error because `DateTime` objects are required by this function. If you want to handle `Date` types differently, you'll need to modify this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,241],"elapsed":1.934973243,"_type":"aimessage"}]
