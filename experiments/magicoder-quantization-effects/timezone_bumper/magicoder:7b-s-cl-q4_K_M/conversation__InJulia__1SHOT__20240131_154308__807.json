The function `timezone_bumper` checks if the input is a DateTime type. If it's not, it throws an error. Then, it increases the time by the specified number of hours. \n\nThe test part of the code demonstrates how to use this function with both DateTime and Date types, and also shows how to handle exceptions when passing a non-DateTime type.","status":200,"tokens":[0,277],"elapsed":2.193536075,"_type":"aimessage"}]
