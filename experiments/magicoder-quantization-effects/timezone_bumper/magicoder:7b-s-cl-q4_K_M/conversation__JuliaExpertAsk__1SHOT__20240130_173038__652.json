The function `timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump=3)` accepts a `DateTime` type and an optional `bump` argument (defaults to 3 hours). It simply adds the amount of time given by the `bump` argument to the provided timestamp (`dt`).\n\nWe use exception handling to catch any errors that occur when passing in a `Date` instead of a `DateTime`. The `@info` macro is used to print out an informational message. In this case, we're only interested in printing messages related to improper usage, so the actual error details aren't needed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,275],"elapsed":2.201332345,"_type":"aimessage"}]
