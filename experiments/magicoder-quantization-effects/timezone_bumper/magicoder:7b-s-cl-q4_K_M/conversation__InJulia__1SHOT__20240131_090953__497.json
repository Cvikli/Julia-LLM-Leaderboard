It also has an optional argument `bump`, which defaults to 3 hours if not provided. Inside the function, it simply adds the number of hours specified by `bump` to the given DateTime object and returns the result.\n\nIf you try to pass a Date type instead of DateTime, Julia will throw an error because Date types do not support arithmetic operations like addition or subtraction with other DateTypes or numbers.","status":200,"tokens":[0,225],"elapsed":1.804548714,"_type":"aimessage"}]
