Then we define our function `timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump=3)`. The function takes two arguments - a DateTime object (`dt`) and an optional Int parameter (`bump`). If no second argument is provided, it defaults to 3 hours.\n\nInside the function, we simply return the result of adding `bump` hours to our input timestamp (`dt`). This operation is performed using the `+` operator with a DateInterval object (`Hour(bump)`).\n\nFinally, we test this function by creating a DateTime object and printing its output.","status":200,"tokens":[0,271],"elapsed":2.192539869,"_type":"aimessage"}]
