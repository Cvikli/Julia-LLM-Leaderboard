If it is not provided, we set the default value to 3 hours (as specified by `bump=3`). We add this many hours to the date time using the `+` operator and the `Hour` constructor from the Dates module.\n- Then, if you provide `Date` type instead of `DateTime`, it throws an error saying that \"This function can only work with DateTime types, not Date types.\"","status":200,"tokens":[0,241],"elapsed":1.934609362,"_type":"aimessage"}]
