If it's not, we throw an error. Then we simply add the specified number of hours to our datetime. \n\nThis function can be tested as follows:\n\n```julia\njulia> timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)\n2023-04-10T15:00:00\n```\nThe function will increase the time by 3 hours in this case.","status":200,"tokens":[0,215],"elapsed":1.733018282,"_type":"aimessage"}]
