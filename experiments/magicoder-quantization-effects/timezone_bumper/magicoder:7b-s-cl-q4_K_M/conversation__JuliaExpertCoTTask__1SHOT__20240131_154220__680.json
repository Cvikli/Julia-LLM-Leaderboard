If it's a `Date`, then an ArgumentError is thrown. Otherwise, it adds `bump` hours to the `DateTime` and returns the result. The `Hour()` function from the Dates module in Julia adds or subtracts hours from a DateTime object.\n\nYou can test this function with your example like so:\n```julia\n@show timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,204],"elapsed":1.63492787,"_type":"aimessage"}]
