We define a function `timezone_bumper` that takes in a DateTime type and an optional argument `bump`. If it is not specified, we use 3 as the default value. The function increases this timestamp by `bump` hours using the `Hour` function from Dates package in Julia.\n2. We then try to call our function with a DateTime object. If this call works, it prints the new DateTime to stdout.\n3. We use a try-catch block to catch any potential errors. In particular, we are checking if the error is of type MethodError and if the error message contains \"DateTime\" to confirm that only DateTime types are allowed. \n4. If the error is not related to the type, we rethrow it to stop the execution of our program and make it easier for us to debug.","status":200,"tokens":[0,326],"elapsed":2.612574759,"_type":"aimessage"}]
