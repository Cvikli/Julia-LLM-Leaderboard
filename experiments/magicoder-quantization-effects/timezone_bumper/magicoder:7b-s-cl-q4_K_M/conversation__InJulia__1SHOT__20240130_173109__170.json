It then returns the original date-time object increased by that many hours. Note that this does not change the timezone, it merely shifts the time forward or backward.\n\nIf you attempt to use it with a `Date` object instead of a `DateTime`, it will throw an error:\n\n```julia\nbump_by_three = timezone_bumper(today())  # This will throw an error\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,240],"elapsed":1.913428046,"_type":"aimessage"}]
