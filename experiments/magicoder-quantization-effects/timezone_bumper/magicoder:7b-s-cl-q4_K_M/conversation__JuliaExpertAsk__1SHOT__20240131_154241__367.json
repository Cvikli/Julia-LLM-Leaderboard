You provided a Date type.\"))\n    end\n    \n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- We use the `Dates` package which is included in Julia's standard library, so there's no need for additional installation or importing.\n- The function `timezone_bumper` takes a DateTime type and an optional integer bump value (defaulting to 3 if not provided).\n- It first checks whether the input date is actually of type DateTime using the `typeof` function. If it's not, then it throws an ArgumentError stating that this function only works with DateTime types.\n- Finally, it returns the input datetime plus the number of hours specified by the bump argument.\n\nTo test this function:\n```julia\ndt = now()\nbump_time = timezone_bumper(dt)  # It will increase dt by default 3 hours.\nbump_time2 = timezone_bumper(dt,5)  # You can specify any bump value you want.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,296],"elapsed":2.356459802,"_type":"aimessage"}]
