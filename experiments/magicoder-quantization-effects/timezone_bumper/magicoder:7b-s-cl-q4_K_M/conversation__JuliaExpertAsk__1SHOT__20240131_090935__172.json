If no argument is provided, it will default to 3 hours. It then returns the DateTime object that has been increased by the specified number of hours.\n\nIf a Date object is passed as an argument instead, it throws an error stating \"Input must be DateTime type. Date is not supported.\" This is because the function was designed specifically for DateTime types and does not support Date types.","status":200,"tokens":[0,191],"elapsed":1.53577143,"_type":"aimessage"}]
