The function `timezone_bumper` takes a DateTime as an argument and increases it by `bump` hours. If a Date (not DateTime) is passed to the function, it throws an error.\n\nYou can call this function like so:\n```julia\ndt = now()  # get current date-time\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt)  # bump time by default of +3 hours\nbumped_dt2 = timezone_bumper(dt, 5)  # bump time by 5 hours\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,239],"elapsed":2.294761198,"_type":"aimessage"}]
