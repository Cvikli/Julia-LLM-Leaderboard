If it's not, an error will be thrown. Then, if it is of `DateTime` type, we increase the time by `bump` hours using `+` operator with `Hour(bump)`. \n\nYou can call this function like this:\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(\"2021-01-01T12:00:00\")\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt)\nprintln(bumped_dt) # Outputs 2021-01-01T15:00:00\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,231],"elapsed":2.243150175,"_type":"aimessage"}]
