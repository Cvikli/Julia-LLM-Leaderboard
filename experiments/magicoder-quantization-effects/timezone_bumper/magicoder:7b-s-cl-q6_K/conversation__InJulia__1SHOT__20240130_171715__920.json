Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the requested function in Julia programming language:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)\n    # Check if dt is a DateTime type\n    if typeof(dt) !== DateTime\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input should be of DateTime type\"))\n    end\n    \n    # Add the required hours to the time\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nThis function `timezone_bumper` takes a single argument, `dt`, which is of type `DateTime`. The default bump is 3 hours. If you don't provide a value for `bump`, the function will use the default value of 3 hours.\n\nThe function checks if the input provided as `dt` is not actually a DateTime object. If it isn't, then an ArgumentError is thrown with the message \"Input should be of DateTime type\".\n\nIf the `dt` is a valid DateTime object, it simply adds the required number of hours (default 3) to that date and time.","status":200,"tokens":[0,231],"elapsed":2.221928426,"_type":"aimessage"}]
