If it is a Date, an ArgumentError will be thrown with an appropriate message. Otherwise, `dt` is increased by `bump` hours and returned. \n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\njulia> dt = DateTime(2021, 1, 1)\n2021-01-01T00:00:00\n\njulia> timezone_bumper(dt)\n2021-01-01T03:00:00\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,224],"elapsed":2.145016278,"_type":"aimessage"}]
