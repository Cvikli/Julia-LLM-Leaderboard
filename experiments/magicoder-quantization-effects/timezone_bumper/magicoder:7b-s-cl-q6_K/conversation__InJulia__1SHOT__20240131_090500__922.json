It checks if `dt` is a DateTime type, and if not, it throws an error. If `dt` is a DateTime, it increases the time by `bump` hours using the `+` operator with `Hour(bump)`.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\ndt = now()  # Get current date and time\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt)  # Bump it by default of +3 hours\nbumped_by_2_hours_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, 2)  # Bump it by 2 hours instead\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,251],"elapsed":2.457067722,"_type":"aimessage"}]
