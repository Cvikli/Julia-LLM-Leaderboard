[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

Please use DateTime instead of Date.\")\nend\n```\nIn this solution:\n- We first import the Dates module which provides functions and types for manipulating dates and times in Julia.\n- The function `timezone_bumper` takes two arguments, dt::DateTime and bump::Int (defaults to 3). If only one argument is provided, it assumes that it's a DateTime object and increases the time by 3 hours.\n- The second function has the same name but with different argument types. It throws an error if a Date type is passed into this function as it should not be used in this context.\n\nThis solution adheres to the problem statement's requirements: it only operates on DateTime objects and throws an error for Date objects, which are not appropriate for this operation.","status":200,"tokens":[0,244],"elapsed":2.416404167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
