Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you could implement this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates  # for DateTime type\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump = 3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# test the function\nprint(timezone_bumper(now()))  # this will add 3 hours to current time and print it.\n```\n\nThis function takes a DateTime `dt` as its first argument, and an optional integer `bump` for how much you want to increase the time by (defaults to 3). It then returns the new DateTime after adding the specified number of hours. If you try to pass in a Date instead, it will throw an error.\n\nIf you want to specifically check if the input is of DateTime type and throw an error otherwise, you could do something like this:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump = 3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# function to handle Date types as well\nfunction timezone_bumper(date::Date, bump = 3)\n    error(\"Input must be a DateTime type\")\nend\n```\nNow if you try to call `timezone_bumper` with a Date object, it will throw an error.","status":200,"tokens":[0,294],"elapsed":2.851384812,"_type":"aimessage"}]
