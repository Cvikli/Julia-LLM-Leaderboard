If it is not `DateTime`, it throws an error.\n- If `dt` is `DateTime`, it adds `bump` hours to it and returns the result.\n\nYou can call this function with a `DateTime` object like so:\n```julia\njulia> timezone_bumper(now())  # bumping time by default +3 hours\n2021-04-09T16:37:40.857\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,204],"elapsed":1.952908585,"_type":"aimessage"}]
