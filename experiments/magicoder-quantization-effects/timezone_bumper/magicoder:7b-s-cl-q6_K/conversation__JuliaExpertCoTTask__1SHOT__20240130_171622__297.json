If it's not, an error is thrown. If it is a DateTime object, it increases the timestamp by the specified number of hours (defaulting to 3). The `Hour` function from the Dates module in Julia is used for this purpose.\n\nYou can then call this function with your DateTime and bump value like:\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,204],"elapsed":1.981990341,"_type":"aimessage"}]
