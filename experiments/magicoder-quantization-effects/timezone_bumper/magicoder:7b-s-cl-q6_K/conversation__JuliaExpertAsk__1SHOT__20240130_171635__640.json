The function `timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump = 3)` checks if the input argument is of type DateTime. If it is not, an error will be thrown as we do not want to work with Date types.\n\nThe line `return dt + Hour(bump)` increases the datetime by the specified number of hours (defaulting to 3).\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(\"2021-12-31T12:00:00\")\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt) # Increases by default 3 hours.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,260],"elapsed":2.554929028,"_type":"aimessage"}]
