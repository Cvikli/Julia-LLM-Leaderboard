If it is a `DateTime`, it adds the number of hours specified in `bump` to the timestamp and returns the result. If it's a `Date`, it throws an error saying that you can't increase time for Date types only DateTime. If `dt` is neither a `DateTime` nor a `Date`, it throws an error saying unknown datetime type.","status":200,"tokens":[103,204],"elapsed":2.004887109,"_type":"aimessage"}]
