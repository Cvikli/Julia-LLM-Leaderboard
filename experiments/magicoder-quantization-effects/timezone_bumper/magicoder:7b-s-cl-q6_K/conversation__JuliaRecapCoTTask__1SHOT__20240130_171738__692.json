[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function written in Julia that follows the instructions above:\n\n```julia\nimport Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Dates.DateTime; bump = 3)\n    if typeof(dt) === Dates.Date\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Provided argument is not a DateTime type.\"))\n    else\n        return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\n    end\nend\n```\nThe function `timezone_bumper` takes a date-time object as input and checks its data type. If it's of `Date` type, the function throws an error message stating that the provided argument is not a DateTime type. If it's a DateTime type, the function increases the time by the number of hours specified in the `bump` parameter (defaulted to 3).\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n```julia\ndt = Dates.now()\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt)\nbumped_24hrs_dt = timezone_bumper(dt,24)\n```\n\nThe first line of code gets the current date-time. The second line bumps it by 3 hours (default), and the third line does the same but bumps it by 24 hours.","status":200,"tokens":[11,284],"elapsed":2.830948363,"_type":"aimessage"}]
