If it's not, an error is thrown. Then, we add the number of hours specified by `bump` to the datetime object and return the result. \n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(2022,1,1)\nbump = 3\nnew_time = timezone_bumper(dt, bump)\nprintln(new_time) # Outputs: 2022-01-01T03:00:00\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,219],"elapsed":2.131039276,"_type":"aimessage"}]
