If no argument is passed for `bump`, it takes a default value of 3 hours.\n- The function checks if input `dt` is a DateTime type. If not, it throws an error with the message \"Input must be a DateTime type\".\n- If it's a DateTime type, it adds `bump` number of hours to it and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,242],"elapsed":2.17908323,"_type":"aimessage"}]
