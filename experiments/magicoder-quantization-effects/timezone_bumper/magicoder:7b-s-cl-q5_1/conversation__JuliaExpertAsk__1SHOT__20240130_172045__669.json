If no argument is provided, it defaults to 3. The function then returns the original `DateTime` increased by `bump` hours.\n\nIf `dt` is not of type `DateTime`, but rather `Date`, then it throws an error with the message \"This function works only for DateTime types.\"","status":200,"tokens":[0,174],"elapsed":1.575777154,"_type":"aimessage"}]
