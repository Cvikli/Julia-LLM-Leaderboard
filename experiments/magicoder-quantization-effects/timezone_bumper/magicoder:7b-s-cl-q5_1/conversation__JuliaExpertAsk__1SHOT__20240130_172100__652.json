The function `timezone_bumper` increases a provided timestamp by a specified number of hours (defaulting to 3). If the input is not a DateTime type, an error will be thrown.\n\nIn this case, I'm using the built-in `now()` function from Dates package to get the current date and time. Then we call our `timezone_bumper` function with this datetime as the argument and print it out. \n\nPlease note that you need to import the Dates module in your program if you haven't done so already.","status":200,"tokens":[0,250],"elapsed":2.264366113,"_type":"aimessage"}]
