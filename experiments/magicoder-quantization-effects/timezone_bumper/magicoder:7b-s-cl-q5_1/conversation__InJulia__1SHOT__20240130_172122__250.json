It adds the value of `bump` to the time in hours. If no `bump` is provided, it defaults to adding 3 hours. The function throws an error if the input is not a DateTime type.\n\nThe test case at the end of the script creates a new DateTime from the current system time, prints this time, then calls `timezone_bumper(dt)` and prints the result. This will show that the timestamp has indeed been increased by 3 hours.","status":200,"tokens":[0,236],"elapsed":2.119562391,"_type":"aimessage"}]
