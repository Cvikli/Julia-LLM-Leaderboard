[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, a user-defined function can be defined with the `function` keyword followed by the name of the function (in this case, `timezone_bumper`), and then specifying its parameters inside parentheses. The body of the function is contained within the indentation of `begin` and `end`. \n\nTo check if a variable belongs to a certain type, use the `is` keyword with a pair of parentheses following it, and include the type that you want to check against in these parentheses. If the condition inside the parentheses returns true, then your object is indeed of that specific type, otherwise, not. \n\nHere's how we can define such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)\n    if typeof(dt) != DateTime\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Timezone bumper only works with DateTime types.\"))\n    end\n\n    dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nIn this function, we use the `DateTime` type annotation to specify that the first argument `dt` should be of the `DateTime` type. The second argument is optional and its default value is 3 hours.\n\nThe function throws an error if the provided timestamp is not a DateTime object by checking if the typeof(dt) equals DateTime. If it doesn't, then an ArgumentError with a custom message \"Timezone bumper only works with DateTime types.\" is thrown.\n\nFinally, it adds the `bump` hours to the date time and returns the result. The `Hour` function from Dates.jl package is used for this purpose. \n\nYou can call this function using the following syntax:\n```julia\ntime = now()                       # gets current timestamp\nbumped_time = timezone_bumper(time) # bumps time by default value (3 hours)\nbumped_time_with_custom_value = timezone_bumper(time, 4)   # bumps time by specified value\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,437],"elapsed":4.035084336,"_type":"aimessage"}]
