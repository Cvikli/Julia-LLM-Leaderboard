If it's not, an error will be thrown with an appropriate message. \n\nThen we simply add the number of hours given by `bump` to the original timestamp using the `+` operator and the `Hour` function from the Dates module. The resulting DateTime object is then returned by the function.","status":200,"tokens":[103,164],"elapsed":1.459696666,"_type":"aimessage"}]
