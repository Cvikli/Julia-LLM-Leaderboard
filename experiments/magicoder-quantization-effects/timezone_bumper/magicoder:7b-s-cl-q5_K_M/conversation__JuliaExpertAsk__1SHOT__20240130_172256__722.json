Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is the Julia code that satisfies your requirements:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump = 3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Testing\ndt = DateTime(\"2022-10-29T15:26:42\")\nprintln(timezone_bumper(dt))\n```\n\nIn this function, we use the `DateTime` type of the Dates.jl package to handle date and time data. The function takes a DateTime object (`dt`) as input with an optional argument `bump`, defaulting to 3 hours if not specified. If you want to increase or decrease the time in a different way, just change the value of `bump`.\n\nThe function returns a new DateTime object that is `bump` hours ahead of the input DateTime (`dt`). This works for DateTime types only and throws an error when Date types are provided (as Date is not a subtype of DateTime). \n\nNote: The testing section uses a simple example to demonstrate how you can call this function. Please replace `\"2022-10-29T15:26:42\"` with your own timestamp string if you want different results.","status":200,"tokens":[0,280],"elapsed":2.451165888,"_type":"aimessage"}]
