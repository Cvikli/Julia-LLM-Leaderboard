Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the requested function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump = 3)\n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# This function will throw an error when a Date type is passed to it.\nfunction timezone_bumper(d::Date, bump = 3)\n    error(\"This function only works with DateTime types.\")\nend\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- `DateTime` is the type for date and time including time zone. It includes milliseconds and nanoseconds.\n- `Date` is the type for dates only, without a time component or time zone. \n- The function `timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump = 3)` increments a given DateTime object by a number of hours (defaulting to 3).\n- The function `timezone_bumper(d::Date, bump = 3)` is set to throw an error if it receives a Date type as its argument.\n  \nYou can call this function with a DateTime object and the desired number of hours to increment. For example:\n```julia\ndt = now()\nbump_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, 5)\nprint(bump_dt)\n```\nThis code will print out the current time plus 5 hours. \nIf you try to call `timezone_bumper` with a Date object, for example:\n```julia\nd = today()\nbump_d = timezone_bumper(d, 2)\nprint(bump_d)\n```\nThis will result in an error.","status":200,"tokens":[0,368],"elapsed":3.213244792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
