If the argument is not provided, it defaults to +3 hours. The function then returns a new `DateTime` object that is the result of adding the value of `bump` to the hour component of the input date time.\n\nThe `@test_throws ErrorException` macro is used to ensure an error is thrown when a `Date` type is passed as an argument instead of a `DateTime`.\n\nFinally, we test this function using the `@test` macro, which checks that the result is equal to the expected value.","status":200,"tokens":[0,275],"elapsed":2.419275941,"_type":"aimessage"}]
