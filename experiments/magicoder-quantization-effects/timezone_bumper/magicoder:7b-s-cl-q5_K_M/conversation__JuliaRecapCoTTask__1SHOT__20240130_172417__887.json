[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is a possible solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump=3)\n    # Check if dt is of DateTime type\n    if typeof(dt) != DateTime \n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be DateTime type\"))\n    end\n\n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Testing the function\nt = now()\nprintln(timezone_bumper(t))   # Returns timestamp increased by default bump of 3 hours\n```\n\nIn this code, we defined a function `timezone_bumper` that accepts two arguments: a date-time value and an optional shift (defaults to 3). If the input is not a DateTime object, it throws an error. Otherwise, it increases the timestamp by the specified number of hours using the `+` operator with Dates.Hour().\n\nWe also included a test case at the end that creates a new datetime from the current time (`now()`) and prints the result of calling our function on this value. Note: `now()` returns the current date-time in the local time zone as a DateTime object. \n\nPlease replace `{{instructions}}` with your special instructions or delete it if there are no specific requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,289],"elapsed":2.583095277,"_type":"aimessage"}]
