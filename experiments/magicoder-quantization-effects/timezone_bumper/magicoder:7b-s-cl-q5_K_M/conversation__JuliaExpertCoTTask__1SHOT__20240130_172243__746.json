Here's how you would do it:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates # Import the DateTime module\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump::Int=3)\n    return Base.add_hours(dt, bump)\nend\n\n# Test with a DateTime type\ntry\n    println(timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)) # Should print 2023-04-10T15:00:00\ncatch e\n    println(\"An error occurred: $e\")\nend\n\n# Test with a Date type (should throw an error)\ntry\n    println(timezone_bumper(Date(2023, 4, 10))) # Should print \"An error occurred\"\ncatch e\n    println(\"An error occurred: $e\")\nend\n```\nThis function takes a DateTime object and adds the specified number of hours to it. If the `bump` argument is not provided, it defaults to adding 3 hours. It checks if the type of dt is DateTime and raises an error when it's not.","status":200,"tokens":[0,315],"elapsed":2.802212323,"_type":"aimessage"}]
