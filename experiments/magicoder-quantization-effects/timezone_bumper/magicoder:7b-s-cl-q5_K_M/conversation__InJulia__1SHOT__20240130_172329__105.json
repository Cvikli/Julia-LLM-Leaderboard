Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can achieve this using the built-in function `DateTime` and a conditional check with `isa`. Here is how you could implement such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)\n    if typeof(dt) != DateTime\n        error(\"Provided type must be of DateTime\") \n    end\n    \n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nIn this function, `dt` is the DateTime object and `bump` is an optional parameter with a default value of 3 hours. The function first checks if the provided input is of type DateTime. If not, it throws an error. Then, it returns a new DateTime object that is bumped by the given amount (default is 3 hours).\n  \nYou can use this function like:\n```julia\ndt = now() # Get current time\nbumped_time = timezone_bumper(dt) \nprintln(bumped_time)\n```\nThis will bump the current time by 3 hours and print it.\nIf you want to bump by a different amount, you can do:\n```julia\nbumped_time = timezone_bumper(dt, 2) # Bumps current time by 2 hours\nprintln(bumped_time)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,298],"elapsed":2.594746956,"_type":"aimessage"}]
