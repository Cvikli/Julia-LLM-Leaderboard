If `bump` is not provided, it defaults to 3. The function checks whether the input data type is DateTime. If it's not, it throws an error. Otherwise, it adds the number of hours specified by `bump` to the date-time object and returns the new value.\n\nLet's test this function using your example:\n```julia\njulia> timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)\n2023-04-10T15:00:00\n```\nThe result is a new DateTime object that has been increased by 3 hours.","status":200,"tokens":[0,260],"elapsed":2.281090699,"_type":"aimessage"}]
