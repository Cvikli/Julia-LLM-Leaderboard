Here is a simple function that increases the timestamp by a specified number of hours:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)\n    dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Testing the function with both DateTime and Date types\ntry \n    println(\"Current Timezone: \", timezone_bumper()) # should print the current datetime\ncatch e \n    println(\"Caught an error: \", sprint(showerror, e))\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a `DateTime` object as input. If no time zone bump is provided (i.e., if `bump` is not specified), it defaults to +3 hours. The `try/catch` block is used here for testing purposes, to catch any errors that may occur when the function is run with invalid inputs.\n\nRemember that this will only work correctly for `DateTime` types and will throw an error if you pass a `Date` type.","status":200,"tokens":[0,240],"elapsed":1.845776349,"_type":"aimessage"}]
