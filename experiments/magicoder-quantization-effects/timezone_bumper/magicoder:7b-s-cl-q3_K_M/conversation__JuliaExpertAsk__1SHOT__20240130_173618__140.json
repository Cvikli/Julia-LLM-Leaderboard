If `dt` is indeed a `DateTime`, we return the result of adding `Hour(bump)` to `dt`. The `Hour` function from the Dates module in Julia adds hours to a date-time value.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n```julia\nd = DateTime(\"2021-08-06T14:23:59\")\nbump_dt = timezone_bumper(d) # returns 2021-08-06T17:23:59\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,244],"elapsed":1.871913938,"_type":"aimessage"}]
