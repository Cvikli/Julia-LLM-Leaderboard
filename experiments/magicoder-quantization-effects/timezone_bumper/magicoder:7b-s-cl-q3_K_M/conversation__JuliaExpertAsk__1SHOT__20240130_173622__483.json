If you provide DateTime argument, the function will increase time by `bump` hours and print out the result. \n\nHere, I am using Dates package for handling dates in Julia. Hour() function is used for increasing date-time by given number of hours.","status":200,"tokens":[0,211],"elapsed":1.644808381,"_type":"aimessage"}]
