This increases or decreases the hour of the datetime object according to the bump value.\n\nIt also has a default value for `bump` which is set as 3. If no value is supplied, it will use this default value.\n\nIf you try to pass in a Date instead of a DateTime, Julia will throw an error:\n```julia\ndate = Date(2021, 1, 1) # This is equivalent to \"Jan 1, 2021\"\nbumped_datetime = timezone_bumper(date) \n# Output: MethodError: no method matching timezone_bumper(::Date)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,337],"elapsed":2.60278398,"_type":"aimessage"}]
