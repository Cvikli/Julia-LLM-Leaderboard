It uses the built-in `TimeZone` module from Julia to handle time zones.\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)\n    if typeof(dt) == Date \n        error(\"Cannot add hours to a Date type\") \n    else \n        return dt + Hour(bump)\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this function, we take a `DateTime` as an input. If the provided type is not `DateTime`, we throw an error. We increase the DateTime by `bump` hours using the `+` operator and then return the result. \n\nTo use it:\n```julia\ndt = now() # get current time\nbumped_time = timezone_bumper(dt)\nprintln(\"Bumped time is $(bumped_time)\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,200],"elapsed":1.538348829,"_type":"aimessage"}]
