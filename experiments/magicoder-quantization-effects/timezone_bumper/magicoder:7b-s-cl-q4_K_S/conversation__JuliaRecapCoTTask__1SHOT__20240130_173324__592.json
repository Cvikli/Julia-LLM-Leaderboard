[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you might implement this in Julia:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nd = DateTime(2022, 1, 1, 10, 0)\nnew_time = timezone_bumper(d)\nprintln(\"New time: \", new_time)\n```\nThis function takes a `DateTime` object as input and returns a `DateTime` object that is exactly `bump` hours after the inputted `DateTime`. The default value for `bump` is 3 if not provided. If you try to pass in a `Date` instead of a `DateTime`, Julia will throw an error:\n```julia\nd = Date(2022, 1, 1) # This line will throw an error because Date and DateTime are different types\nnew_time = timezone_bumper(d)\n```\nYou can change the default value of `bump` in the function by providing a second argument to it. For example, if you want the function to increase time by 1 hour instead of 3 hours, call it like this:\n```julia\nnew_time = timezone_bumper(d, 1)\n```\nIn this case, `bump` is set to 1, so the function will add 1 hour to the inputted time.","status":200,"tokens":[0,326],"elapsed":2.58484406,"_type":"aimessage"}]
