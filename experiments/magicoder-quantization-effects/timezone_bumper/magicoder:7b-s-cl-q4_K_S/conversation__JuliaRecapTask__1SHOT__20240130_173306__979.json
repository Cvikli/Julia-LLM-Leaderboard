[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump=3)\n    if typeof(dt) !== DateTime\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be of type DateTime\"))\n    end\n    \n    dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nIn this solution, the function `timezone_bumper` takes a DateTime object and an optional argument 'bump'. The default value for 'bump' is set to 3. If bump is not provided when calling the function, it will use the default value (3).\n\nIf the first input argument isn't of type `DateTime`, it throws an error with the message \"Input must be of type DateTime\". If it is a `DateTime` object, it returns a new DateTime that has been increased by bump hours.\n\nPlease note that this code snippet doesn't actually do anything with timezones; if you want to apply timezone adjustment you would need to use TimeZone library or similar.","status":200,"tokens":[0,229],"elapsed":1.813523492,"_type":"aimessage"}]
