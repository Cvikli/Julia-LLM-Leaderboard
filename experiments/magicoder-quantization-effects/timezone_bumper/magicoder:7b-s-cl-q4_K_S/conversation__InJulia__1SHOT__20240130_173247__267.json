The default value of `bump` is set to 3. If no argument is passed for `bump`, it will take a value of 3 as well. This function throws an error when a `Date` object is provided instead of a `DateTime`. This can be enforced using type assertions or type declarations, depending on your requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[73,208],"elapsed":1.619509717,"_type":"aimessage"}]
