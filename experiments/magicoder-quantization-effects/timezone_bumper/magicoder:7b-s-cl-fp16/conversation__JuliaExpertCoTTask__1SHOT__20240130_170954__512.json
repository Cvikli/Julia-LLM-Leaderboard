If it's not a DateTime, then it throws an exception stating \"Date type is not accepted\". Otherwise, it returns the input timestamp increased by the number of hours specified in the second argument (defaults to 3).\n\nYou can call this function using your data like this:\n```julia\nprintln(timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)) # Output: 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,226],"elapsed":3.938194392,"_type":"aimessage"}]
