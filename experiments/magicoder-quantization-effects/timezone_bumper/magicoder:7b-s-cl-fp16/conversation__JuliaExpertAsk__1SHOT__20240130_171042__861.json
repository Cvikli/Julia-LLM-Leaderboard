If not, it throws an error. Otherwise, it adds `bump` hours to the date time and returns the result. The `Hour(bump)` function is provided by Julia's Dates module for adding or subtracting hours from a date-time value.\n\nHere are some examples of usage:\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(\"2021-08-29T17:34\")  # example timestamp\nbump_3hours = timezone_bumper(dt)   # returns \"2021-08-29T18:34\"\nbump_4hours = timezone_bumper(dt, 4)  # returns \"2021-08-29T19:34\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,268],"elapsed":4.694096182,"_type":"aimessage"}]
