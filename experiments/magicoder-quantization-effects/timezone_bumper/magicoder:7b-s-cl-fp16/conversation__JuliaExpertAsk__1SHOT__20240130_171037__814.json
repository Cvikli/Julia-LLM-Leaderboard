The function `timezone_bumper` takes a `DateTime` or `Date` type as input and an optional second argument that specifies the number of hours to bump the timestamp by (default is 3 hours).\n4. If you pass it a `DateTime`, it adds the specified amount of time in hours to that timestamp and returns the new value.\n5. If you pass it a `Date` type, it throws an error, because `Date` types don't have hour information.","status":200,"tokens":[0,242],"elapsed":4.221396556,"_type":"aimessage"}]
