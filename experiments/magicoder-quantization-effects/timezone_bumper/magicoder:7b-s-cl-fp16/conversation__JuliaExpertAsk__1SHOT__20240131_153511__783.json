The function `timezone_bumper` takes a DateTime object and an optional bump argument (defaults to 3). If the provided type is not a DateTime, it throws an ArgumentError stating that the function works only for DateTime types. Otherwise, it adds the specified number of hours to the DateTime object and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,178],"elapsed":3.069074059,"_type":"aimessage"}]
