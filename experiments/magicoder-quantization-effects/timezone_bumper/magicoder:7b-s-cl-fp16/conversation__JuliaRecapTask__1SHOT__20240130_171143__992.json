[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function in Julia which meets the requirements:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)\n    # check if dt is DateTime type\n    @assert isa(dt, DateTime) \"Input must be of DateTime type.\"\n\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nIn this function:\n- `Dates` package is used which is a part of Julia Standard Library. It provides a full range of date and time functionality.\n- `@assert` macro is used to check if the input provided for `dt` is of DateTime type. If it's not, it throws an error.\n- We return the result of adding `bump` hours to `dt`. The `Hour(bump)` part creates a duration representing `bump` hours, and then `dt + Hour(bump)` adds that duration to `dt`, resulting in a new DateTime object with `bump` hours added.\n- If the user provides special instructions not covered by this function, please specify them here.","status":200,"tokens":[0,239],"elapsed":4.204307595,"_type":"aimessage"}]
