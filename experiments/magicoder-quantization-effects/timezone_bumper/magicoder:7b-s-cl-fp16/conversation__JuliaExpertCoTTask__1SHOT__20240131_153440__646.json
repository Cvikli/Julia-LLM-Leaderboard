Here's how to do it:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)\n    if typeof(dt) == Date\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Date type not accepted, DateTime required.\"))\n    else\n        return dt + Hour(bump)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- We define the function `timezone_bumper` that takes a `DateTime` as input. If it is not provided, it defaults to 3 hours.\n- Inside the function, we check if the type of `dt` is equal to Date. If yes, we throw an error.\n- If `dt` is not a Date, we return `dt` increased by `bump` hours.\n\nYou can call this function with your example like this:\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)\n```\n\nThis will return the timestamp `2023-04-10T15:00:00`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,283],"elapsed":4.901755407,"_type":"aimessage"}]
