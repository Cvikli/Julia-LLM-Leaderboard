If it's not, an error message will be displayed. If the input is a DateTime, then the function will add the number of hours specified by 'bump'. The resulting DateTime is returned.\n\nYou can call this function with a DateTime and bump as follows:\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)\n```\nThis will return `DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 15, 0)`.","status":200,"tokens":[244,224],"elapsed":32.575409002,"_type":"aimessage"}]
