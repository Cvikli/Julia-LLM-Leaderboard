If it's not, an error is thrown with a descriptive message. If the input is valid, we simply add the number of hours specified by `bump` to the input datetime and return the result. \n\nTo use this function, you can do something like:\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(2021, 1, 1)\nbump = 3\nresult = timezone_bumper(dt, bump)\nprintln(result) # Outputs: 2021-01-01T03:00:00\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,227],"elapsed":3.914222138,"_type":"aimessage"}]
