It also checks if the bump is within the range of -24 to 24 (i.e., 24 hours in either direction), if not, an error will be thrown. If the user does not provide a bump value, it defaults to +3 hours.\n\nPlease note that this function doesn't decrease the time or handle cases when the new DateTime would go beyond the start/end of the month (i.e., rollover from end of month to next month).","status":200,"tokens":[73,315],"elapsed":5.480760553,"_type":"aimessage"}]
