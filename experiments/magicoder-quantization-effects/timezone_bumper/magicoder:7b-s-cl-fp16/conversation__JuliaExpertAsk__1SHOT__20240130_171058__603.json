If not, an ArgumentError will be thrown with a message indicating that a DateTime was expected but something else was provided instead. Then, it simply adds the bump amount to the original date and time using the `+` operator, which automatically converts the integer `bump` into a duration in hours.\n\nPlease make sure you have Dates package installed if not use: Pkg.add(\"Dates\")","status":200,"tokens":[0,260],"elapsed":4.522648092,"_type":"aimessage"}]
