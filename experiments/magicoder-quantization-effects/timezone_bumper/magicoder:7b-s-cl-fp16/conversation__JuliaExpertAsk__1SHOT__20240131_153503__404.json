The function `timezone_bumber` takes a DateTime type as input and returns it increased by the specified number of hours (defaults to 3). If a Date type is passed instead, an error will be thrown. We then test the function with both valid and invalid inputs using `@test` and `@test_throws`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,238],"elapsed":4.104771869,"_type":"aimessage"}]
