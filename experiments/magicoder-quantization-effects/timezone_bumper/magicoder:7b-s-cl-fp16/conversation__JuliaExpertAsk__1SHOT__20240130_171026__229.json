The `timezone_bumper` function increases the date/time by the specified number of hours (defaults to 3). If you input a `Date` instead of `DateTime`, it will throw an error since it does not make sense to add hours to a Date, only to a DateTime.\n\nPlease note that `Hour` is part of the `Dates` module in Julia and represents one hour. The function takes a `DateTime` as input, and returns the same time but shifted by the specified number of hours (default 3).","status":200,"tokens":[0,268],"elapsed":4.701393789,"_type":"aimessage"}]
