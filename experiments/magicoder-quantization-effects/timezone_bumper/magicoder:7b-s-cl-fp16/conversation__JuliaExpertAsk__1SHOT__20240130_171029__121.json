If the input is a `DateTime`, it increases the time by the specified number of hours and returns the result.\n\nIf the input is a `Date` type, it throws an error because Date does not include timezone information and cannot be manipulated as easily as DateTime can.","status":200,"tokens":[0,173],"elapsed":3.05028769,"_type":"aimessage"}]
