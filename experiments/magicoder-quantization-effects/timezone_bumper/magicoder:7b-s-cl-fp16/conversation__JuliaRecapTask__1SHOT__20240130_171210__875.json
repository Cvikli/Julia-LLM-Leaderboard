[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

If you want to decrease instead of increasing, just change `bump=3` to `bump=-3`.\n\nHowever, it throws an error for Date types as per the problem statement:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(d::Date)\n    error(\"Please provide a DateTime type\")\nend\n\n# Testing it out\nd = Date(\"2021-09-07\") # for example, this is a date\nprintln(timezone_bumper(d))  # This will throw an error\n```\nThis function `timezone_bumper` checks if the input type is DateTime or not. If it is not, then it throws an error.","status":200,"tokens":[0,298],"elapsed":5.242555452,"_type":"aimessage"}]
