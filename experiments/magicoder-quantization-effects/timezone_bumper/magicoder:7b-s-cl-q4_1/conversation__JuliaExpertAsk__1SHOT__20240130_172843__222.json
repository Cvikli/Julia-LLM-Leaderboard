A Date type was provided.\"))\nend\n```\nIn the above code, `DateTime` is a type from Dates module in Julia. This function takes a `DateTime` as input and increases it by any number of hours you want (`bump`). If no bump value is provided, it defaults to 3 hours. A Date type is not accepted for this function because the function only works with DateTime types. If a Date type is passed in, an ArgumentError will be thrown.","status":200,"tokens":[0,183],"elapsed":1.457053125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
