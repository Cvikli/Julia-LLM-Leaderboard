If not, it throws an error. If the argument is of type `DateTime`, the function increases the time by the amount specified in `bump` and returns the resulting date-time object.\n\nYou can call this function with a DateTime object as follows:\n```julia\ndt = timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)\nprintln(dt) # prints \"2023-04-10T15:00:00\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,226],"elapsed":1.811023591,"_type":"aimessage"}]
