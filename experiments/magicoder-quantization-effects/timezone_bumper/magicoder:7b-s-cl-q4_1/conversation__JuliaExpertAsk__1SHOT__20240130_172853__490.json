The function then returns the updated DateTime after adding the bump hours to it. If a Date type is provided as input, an ArgumentError with the message \"Only DateTime types are allowed.\" will be thrown.\n\nYou can call this function like below:\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(2021, 12, 31)\nbump_by_three = timezone_bumper(dt)\nprint(bump_by_three) # prints \"2022-01-01T03:00:00\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,249],"elapsed":1.987505284,"_type":"aimessage"}]
