Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia code which implements your requirement:\n\n```julia\nimport Dates  # Import this module if not already done so\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Dates.DateTime, bump = 3)\n    # Check if the input is a DateTime type\n    @assert dt isa Dates.DateTime \"Only DateTime types are allowed.\"\n    \n    # Increase the timestamp by bump hours\n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Testing the function\ndt = Dates.now()   # Get current date and time\nbumped_time = timezone_bumper(dt, 2)    # Bump it forward by 2 hours\nprintln(bumped_time)\n```\n\nThis code first checks if the input `dt` is a DateTime type with `@assert dt isa Dates.DateTime \"Only DateTime types are allowed.\"`. If not, an assertion error is thrown.\n\nIf the input is of correct type, it then adds `bump` hours to it using `dt + Dates.Hour(bump)`. \n\nThe `Dates.Hour` function from the `Dates` module in Julia is used to specify the time duration for adding or subtracting from a DateTime object. The plus sign (+) is used for addition and minus sign (-) for subtraction. Here, `bump` hours are added to `dt`.\n\nThis code also includes some testing at the end.","status":200,"tokens":[0,327],"elapsed":2.611667561,"_type":"aimessage"}]
