If no bump argument is provided, it defaults to 3 hours. The function simply adds the specified number of hours to the datetime object.\n\nPlease note that this will only work for DateTime types and not Date types. If you pass in a Date type, Julia will throw an error because Date does not support arithmetic operations like DateTime does.","status":200,"tokens":[103,218],"elapsed":1.765586536,"_type":"aimessage"}]
