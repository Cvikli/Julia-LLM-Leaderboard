By default, bump is set to 3. If bump is not provided, it defaults to 3.\n\nIf timezone_bumper receives a Date type, it throws an error saying that you can't increase time for a Date type.\n\nThis function ensures that only DateTime types are accepted and increases the time as per your request. It also handles exceptions gracefully in case of Date type input, throwing an ArgumentError if such an attempt is made.","status":200,"tokens":[0,243],"elapsed":1.937284714,"_type":"aimessage"}]
