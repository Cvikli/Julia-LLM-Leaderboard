[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(d::Date)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"Date type is not supported. Only DateTime types are allowed.\"))\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, the function `timezone_bumper` has two methods. The first one accepts a DateTime and an optional argument bump which defaults to 3. It returns a new DateTime that represents the same time as the input but shifted by the amount of hours specified in the bump parameter. The second function is for Date types, and it throws an error message when called with a Date type. This makes sure that only DateTime objects can be used with this function.\n\nHere's how you might use these functions:\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(2019, 5, 1, 23) # 5/1/2019 at 23:00\nbumped_time = timezone_bumper(dt) \nprintln(\"Bumped time: $bumped_time\")\n```\nThe bumped time will be printed as `2019-05-02T02:00:00`.\nIf you try to use it on a Date type, an error would occur.","status":200,"tokens":[0,316],"elapsed":2.588522511,"_type":"aimessage"}]
