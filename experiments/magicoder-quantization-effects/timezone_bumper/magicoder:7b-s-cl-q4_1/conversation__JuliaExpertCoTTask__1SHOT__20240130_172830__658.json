Similarly, `bump::Int=3` sets default bump value to 3 if not explicitly provided. The function throws an error when the `dt` parameter is of type `Date`, since it can't be used as a timestamp without time.\n\nYou would call this function like so:\n```julia\ndatetime = timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)\n```\nThis will return the DateTime that is 3 hours later than the provided date-time.","status":200,"tokens":[0,280],"elapsed":2.249220127,"_type":"aimessage"}]
