We use the Dates package in Julia to handle date-time operations. \n2. The `timezone_bumper` function is defined to increase a given timestamp by `bump` hours (defaults to +3 hours). It checks if the input argument is a DateTime type and increases it accordingly, otherwise throws an error. This is achieved by using Julia's operator overloading for the `+` operation with the Dates.Hour object.\n3. The function `timezone_bumper(d::Date)` is defined to throw an error if a Date object is passed as input since it is not possible to add hours to a Date, only to a DateTime. \n4. In Julia, if you call a function with the wrong type of argument (as in this case), then Julia will automatically call the appropriate method for handling this situation, which is the `timezone_bumper(d::Date)` function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,288],"elapsed":2.29719503,"_type":"aimessage"}]
