Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the Julia function that implements this behavior:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date; bump=3)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"Provided argument should be of DateTime type, not Date\"))\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nThis function checks if the provided argument `dt` is a `Date` or `DateTime`. If it's a `Date`, it throws an error. If it's a `DateTime`, it increases the time by `bump` hours.\n\nIn this function, the keyword arguments `bump` with a default value of 3 is used to increase the date-time by `bump` hours. The function returns the new bumped DateTime.\n\nNow let's test our function:\n\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt)\nprintln(bumped_dt) # prints \"2023-04-10T15:00:00\" which is the expected result.\n```\nWhen running this code, if a date argument is used instead of DateTime, it will throw an error. This function is written in such way that it checks whether provided argument's type matches the required types (Date or DateTime) and throws appropriate errors when these conditions are not met.","status":200,"tokens":[0,340],"elapsed":2.598132405,"_type":"aimessage"}]
