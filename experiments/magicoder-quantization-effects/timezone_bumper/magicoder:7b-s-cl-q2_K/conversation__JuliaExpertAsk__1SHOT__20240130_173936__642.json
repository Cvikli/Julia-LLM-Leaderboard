Use a different function for other date types.\"))\n    else\n        return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this script, we define the function `timezone_bumper()`. The function takes two arguments: a `DateTime` object and an integer representing hours to bump. If no argument is provided for either of these parameters, they default to the current time (`now()`) and +3 hours respectively. \n\nThe function first checks if the type of input is Date, if it is then it throws an ArgumentError indicating that this function can only work with DateTime types. Otherwise, it adds the bump value (defaults to 3) to the provided datetime and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,221],"elapsed":1.670230987,"_type":"aimessage"}]
