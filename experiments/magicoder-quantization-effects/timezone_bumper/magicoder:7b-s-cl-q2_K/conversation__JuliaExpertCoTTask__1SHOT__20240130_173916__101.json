If you pass it a Date, it throws an error as timezone manipulations are not defined for Date types. If you pass it a DateTime, it will increase the time by the specified bump hours.\n\nHere is how to use this function:\n\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3) # Output: 2023-04-10T15:00:00.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,204],"elapsed":1.547387592,"_type":"aimessage"}]
