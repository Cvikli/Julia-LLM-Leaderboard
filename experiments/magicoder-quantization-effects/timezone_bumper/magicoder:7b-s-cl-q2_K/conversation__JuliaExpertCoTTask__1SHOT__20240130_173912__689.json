If `dt` is not a DateTime type, it throws an error saying that the function works only for DateTime types. Otherwise, it returns the DateTime with increased by 'bump' hours.\n\nTo test this function you can call:\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,244],"elapsed":1.879530905,"_type":"aimessage"}]
