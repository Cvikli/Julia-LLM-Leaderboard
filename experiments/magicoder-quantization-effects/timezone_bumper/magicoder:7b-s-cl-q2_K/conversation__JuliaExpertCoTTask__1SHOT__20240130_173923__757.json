Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia function that accomplishes the task:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::T, bump = 3) where {T <: DateTime}\n    if T <: Date\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Can only apply to `DateTime` type.\"))\n    elseif iszero(bump)\n        return dt\n    else\n        return dt + Hour(abs(bump))\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this function, we first check whether the input type T is a subtype of DateTime. If not, we throw an ArgumentError stating that it must be a `DateTime` type. We also handle a special case where bump is zero and return dt directly in such cases. Otherwise, we add or subtract the absolute value of bump hours from the datetime to achieve the desired bump effect.\n\nWe can test our function with:\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)\nbump = 3\nresult = timezone_bumper(dt, bump)\nprintln(\"$dt + $bump hours = $(timezone_bumper(dt, bump))\")\n```\nThis will print: `2023-04-10T15:00` which is the result of adding 3 hours to `2023-04-10T12:00`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,325],"elapsed":2.495197624,"_type":"aimessage"}]
