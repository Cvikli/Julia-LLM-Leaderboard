If a DateTime instance is provided, it increases it by the specified number of hours (defaults to 3). If bump is less than 0 or if dt is of Date type, an exception will be thrown. The function returns the new DateTime instance after bumping.\n\nHere's how you can call this function:\n\n```julia\ndt = now()\nbump = 5\nnew_time = timezone_bumper(dt, bump)\nprintln(\"New Time: $new_time\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,232],"elapsed":1.750353179,"_type":"aimessage"}]
