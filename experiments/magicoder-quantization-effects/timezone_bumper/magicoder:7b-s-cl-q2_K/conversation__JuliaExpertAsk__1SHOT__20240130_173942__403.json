If `dt` is of type `Date`, it will throw an error because `Date` does not support time calculations. The `typeof` function in Julia compares objects or variables and returns their type.\n\nIf `dt` is a `DateTime`, it adds the number of hours specified by `bump`. If `bump` is omitted, it defaults to 3 hours.","status":200,"tokens":[0,180],"elapsed":1.3569256,"_type":"aimessage"}]
