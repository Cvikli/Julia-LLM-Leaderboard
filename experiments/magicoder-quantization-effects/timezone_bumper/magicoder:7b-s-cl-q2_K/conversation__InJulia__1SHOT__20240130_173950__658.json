Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here is your requested function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)\n    if typeof(dt) == Date\n        error(\"Date type is not allowed in this function, use DateTime instead\")\n    else\n       return dt + Hour(bump)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function will work for any DateTime type input. If a date (instead of datetime) is passed as an argument, it will raise an error saying \"Date type is not allowed in this function, use DateTime instead\". \n\nPlease note that the bump parameter defaults to 3 if no value is provided. So, calling `timezone_bumper(dt)` with a DateTime object would increase its timezone by 3 hours and calling `timezone_bumper(dt; bump=5)` with a DateTime object would increase its timezone by 5 hours.","status":200,"tokens":[0,202],"elapsed":1.516632581,"_type":"aimessage"}]
