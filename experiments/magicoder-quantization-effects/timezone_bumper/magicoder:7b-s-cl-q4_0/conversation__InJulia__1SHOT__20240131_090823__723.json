If no `bump` value is supplied, it defaults to 3 hours. The function throws an error when called with a Date type argument.\n\nHere's how you can test this function:\n\n```julia\ndt = now()  # get current date and time\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt)  # bumps it by default 3 hours\nprintln(\"Bumped DateTime: \", bumed_dt)\n\n# This will throw an error because Date type is not supported.\nbumped_date = timezone_bumper(today())  # should throw an error\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,264],"elapsed":2.009809506,"_type":"aimessage"}]
