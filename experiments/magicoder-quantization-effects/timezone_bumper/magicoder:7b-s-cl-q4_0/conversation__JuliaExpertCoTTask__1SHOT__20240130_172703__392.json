When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

If you try to call it with something other than a DateTime, like a Date:\n\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(Date(2023, 4, 10))\n```\n\nIt will throw an error because it checks if the argument is of type `DateTime`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,241],"elapsed":1.838040874,"_type":"aimessage"}]
