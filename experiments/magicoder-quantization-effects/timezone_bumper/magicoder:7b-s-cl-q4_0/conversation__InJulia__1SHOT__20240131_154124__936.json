Here is a function named `timezone_bumper(dt, bump=3)` that will do exactly as described:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump=3)\n    if typeof(dt) == Date\n        error(\"This function does not work for Date types. Please use DateTime.\")\n    else\n        return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\n    end\nend\n```\nThe `typeof` function is used to determine the type of a variable, and if it's not a `DateTime`, an error message is displayed. If it is a `DateTime`, the function simply adds the specified number of hours (defaults to 3) to the timestamp using `Dates.Hour`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,179],"elapsed":1.33572719,"_type":"aimessage"}]
