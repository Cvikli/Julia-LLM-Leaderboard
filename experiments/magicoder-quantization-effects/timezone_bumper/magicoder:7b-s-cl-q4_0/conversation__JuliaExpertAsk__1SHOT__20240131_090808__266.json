If no value is provided for `bump`, it defaults to 3.\n- Inside the function, we first check if the type of `dt` is Date. If so, we throw an error. Otherwise, we return the result of adding `bump` hours to `dt`.\n- The `Hour(bump)` part is used to add `bump` hours to `dt`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,236],"elapsed":1.81765715,"_type":"aimessage"}]
