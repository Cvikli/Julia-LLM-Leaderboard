If no value is provided for `bump`, it defaults to 3. The function then returns the input datetime plus the number of hours specified by `bump`.\n\nThe `println` statements are used to print out the original time and the bumped time.\n\nNote that this code will throw an error if you try to pass a Date object instead of a DateTime object. This is because Date objects do not have a concept of timezone, while DateTime objects do.","status":200,"tokens":[0,234],"elapsed":1.788379148,"_type":"aimessage"}]
