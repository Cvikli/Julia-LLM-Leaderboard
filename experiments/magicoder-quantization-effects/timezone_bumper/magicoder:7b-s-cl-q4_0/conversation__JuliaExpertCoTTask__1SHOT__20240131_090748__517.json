If the input is valid, it adds the specified number of hours to the timestamp using the `+` operator with `Hour`.\n\nYou can call this function like so:\n\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)\n```\n\nThis will return a new DateTime object that is three hours later than the input.","status":200,"tokens":[0,191],"elapsed":1.473449217,"_type":"aimessage"}]
