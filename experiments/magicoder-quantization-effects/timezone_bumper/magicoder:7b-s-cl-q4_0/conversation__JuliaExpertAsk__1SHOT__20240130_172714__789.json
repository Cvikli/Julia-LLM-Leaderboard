You can replace it with any specific date and time if needed.\n- `Dates.Hour(bump)` increases the time by bump hours. \n\nIf you pass a Date type instead of DateTime to this function, it throws an error saying \"This function only works with DateTime types, not with Date types.\" If the type of `dt` is neither DateTime nor Date, it throws an error saying \"Unknown input type for `dt`.\"","status":200,"tokens":[0,238],"elapsed":1.810170011,"_type":"aimessage"}]
