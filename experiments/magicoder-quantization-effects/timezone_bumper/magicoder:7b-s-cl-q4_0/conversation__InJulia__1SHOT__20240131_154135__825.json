By default, if no `bump` is provided, it will bump the timestamp by +3 hours. \n\nIf you try to pass a Date type instead of DateTime, Julia's multiple dispatch feature will throw an error because there isn't a defined method for adding an Integer to a Date object. \n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(d::Date; bump::Int=3)\n    # This line won't be reached as the function is not defined for Date types\n    return d + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Testing the function with a Date type\nd = Date(2021, 1, 1) # Test date\nb = 5 # Bump hours\ntimezone_bumper(d, b) # Throws an error: MethodError: no method matching +(::Date, ::Int64)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,356],"elapsed":2.677633441,"_type":"aimessage"}]
