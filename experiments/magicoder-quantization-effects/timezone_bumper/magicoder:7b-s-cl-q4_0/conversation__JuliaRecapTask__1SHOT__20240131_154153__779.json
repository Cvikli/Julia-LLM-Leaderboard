[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can solve the problem with the following code:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Test the function\nt = now()\nbumped_time = timezone_bumper(t)\nprintln(\"Bumped time: \", bumped_time)\n```\n\nThis function `timezone_bumper` takes a DateTime type argument and an optional Int argument. It increases (or decreases, if the value of `bump` is negative) the timestamp by 3 hours (by default). If you provide another value to the `bump` parameter, it will increase the timestamp by that number of hours instead.\n\nNote: This function does not support Date types because the concept of \"hour\" doesn't exist for a date without a time. A Date in Julia is just a year-month-day triple, with no hour, minute or second attached to it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,226],"elapsed":1.737819429,"_type":"aimessage"}]
