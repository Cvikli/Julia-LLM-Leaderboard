[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

It then adds the bump hours to the DateTime. If no argument for `bump` is provided, it defaults to 3. This function will work only if `dt` is of type `DateTime`, and will throw an error if `dt` is of type `Date`.\n\nThe testing part at the end creates a DateTime object `t` that represents August 15th, 2021 at 5 PM (UTC+5), then calls our function with this datetime. The output should be `DateTime(\"2021-08-16T01:00:00\")` which is the same date and time but shifted three hours forward to become August 16th, 2021 at 1 AM (UTC+3).","status":200,"tokens":[0,308],"elapsed":2.374102188,"_type":"aimessage"}]
