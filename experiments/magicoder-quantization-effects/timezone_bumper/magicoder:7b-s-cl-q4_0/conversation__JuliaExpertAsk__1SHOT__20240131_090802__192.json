Then, we define a function `timezone_bumper` that takes a `DateTime` object as input and returns it bumped by the specified number of hours (defaults to 3). If a `Date` type is passed instead, a `MethodError` will be thrown because the addition operation between `DateTime` and `Hour` is not defined.\n\nWe then test this function with a `DateTime` object, and catch any errors that may occur during execution. If a `MethodError` occurs (which would happen if we tried to add an hour to a `Date`), we print an error message indicating that the function only works with DateTime types.","status":200,"tokens":[0,314],"elapsed":2.412382294,"_type":"aimessage"}]
