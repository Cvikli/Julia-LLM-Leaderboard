It then returns the timestamp after adding the number of hours specified by the `bump` parameter. If no argument is provided, it defaults to 3 hours.\n\nIf you try to run this function with a Date type instead, Julia will throw an error because it's not defined for Date types. This is enforced via the type assertion `::DateTime`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,228],"elapsed":1.710312186,"_type":"aimessage"}]
