It checks the type of the first argument, if it's not `DateTime`, it throws an error. If it is `DateTime`, it adds the number of hours specified in the second argument to the DateTime object and returns the result.\n\nHere's how you can call this function:\n```julia\ndt = now() # Get current date and time\nbump_dt = timezone_bumper(dt) \n# or with a bump of 2 hours\nbump_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, 2)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,215],"elapsed":1.640639372,"_type":"aimessage"}]
