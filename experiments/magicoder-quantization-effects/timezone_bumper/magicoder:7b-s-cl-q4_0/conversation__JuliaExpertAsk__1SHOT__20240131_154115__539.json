Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia code that solves your problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump = 3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"The function only works with DateTime types\"))\nend\n```\nThis function `timezone_bumper` takes a `DateTime` type and an optional argument `bump`. If no argument is supplied, it defaults to 3. It simply adds the number of hours specified by `bump` to the date-time object `dt`.\n\nHowever, if you try to pass a `Date` type to this function, it will throw an error as stated in your question. This is because `Date` and `DateTime` are different types in Julia's standard library `Dates`. A `Date` represents the date part of a datetime while `DateTime` represents both the date and time parts of a datetime.\n\nThe function `timezone_bumper(dt::Date)` has been defined to throw an error when it receives a `Date` type, as specified in your question.","status":200,"tokens":[0,256],"elapsed":1.92058904,"_type":"aimessage"}]
