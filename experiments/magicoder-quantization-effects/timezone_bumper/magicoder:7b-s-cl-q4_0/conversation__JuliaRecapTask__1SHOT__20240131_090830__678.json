[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple function in Julia that meets the requirements:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a DateTime object and an optional `bump` parameter. If no `bump` is provided, it defaults to 3 hours. It then returns the DateTime object that has been increased by the specified number of hours.\n\nIf you try to pass in a Date type instead of a DateTime type, Julia will throw an error:\n\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(Date(2021, 1, 1)) # Throws an error\n```\n\nThis is because the function `timezone_bumper` has been defined to only accept DateTime types. If you try to pass in a Date type, Julia will complain that there's no method for `timezone_bumper` that accepts a Date type as its first argument.","status":200,"tokens":[0,223],"elapsed":1.747914038,"_type":"aimessage"}]
