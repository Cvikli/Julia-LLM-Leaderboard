Here is how you could write such a function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)\n    if typeof(dt) <: Date\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Can only operate on DateTime types, not Date.\"))\n    end\n    \n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nThis function will take a `DateTime` type as an argument and then add the specified number of hours (defaulting to 3) to it. If you pass in a `Date`, it will throw an error saying that it can only operate on DateTime types, not Date.","status":200,"tokens":[0,172],"elapsed":1.32757329,"_type":"aimessage"}]
