[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is the Julia function, that can solve this problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates  # Import date functionality in julia\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump = 3)::DateTime\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Testing the function\ndt = now()  # Get current date-time\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt)  # Bumps the time by 3 hours\nprintln(\"Bumped DateTime: \", bumped_dt)\n```\n\nThe above function `timezone_bumper` takes a single argument `dt::DateTime`. It checks whether `dt` is of type `DateTime`. If it's not, it throws an error. If yes, it adds the number of hours specified by `bump` to `dt`, and returns the result.\n\nNote: This function will work on any `DateTime` instance you pass in (including a timestamp that is 24 hours behind your current time), but if you try to pass in a Date, Julia will throw an error because Dates are not directly comparable with DateTime types.","status":200,"tokens":[11,250],"elapsed":1.954257754,"_type":"aimessage"}]
