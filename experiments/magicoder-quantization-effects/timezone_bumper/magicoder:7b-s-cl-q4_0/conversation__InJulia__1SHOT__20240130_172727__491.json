Use DateTime instead.\")\nend\n```\nThis code defines two functions: `timezone_bumper` that takes a DateTime and an optional bump parameter (defaulting to 3), and returns theDateTime with the bump hours added, as well as another function `timezone_bumper` that takes a Date and throws an error when called. These functions are useful for adding a default amount of time or customizing the time, while ensuring that the input is of correct type to avoid potential errors in processing.","status":200,"tokens":[0,179],"elapsed":1.350635561,"_type":"aimessage"}]
