The function will return the new DateTime after adding `bump` hours to it. If no argument is provided, it defaults to 3 hours. \n\nPlease note that this code assumes you are using the Dates module from Julia's standard library which provides functions for dealing with dates and times.\n\nIf a Date object is passed instead of a DateTime object, the function will throw an error because Date objects do not contain time information. If you wish to handle Date objects differently, you could add another conditional statement to check if `dt` is a Date type before attempting to bump it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,257],"elapsed":1.926393085,"_type":"aimessage"}]
