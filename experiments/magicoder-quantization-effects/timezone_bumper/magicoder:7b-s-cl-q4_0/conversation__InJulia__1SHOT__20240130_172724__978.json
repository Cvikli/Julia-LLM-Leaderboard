Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is the implementation in Julia:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump=3)\n    # increase the timestamp by bump hours\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# throws an error for Date types\nfunction timezone_bumper(d::Date, bump=3)\n   throw(ArgumentError(\"The function does not support Date type. Please use DateTime instead.\"))\nend\n```\nIn the above code, we define two functions `timezone_bumper`. The first one accepts a `DateTime` and an optional argument `bump`. If no `bump` is provided, it defaults to 3 hours. It then increments the timestamp by this amount and returns the result.\n\nThe second function takes a `Date` and a `bump`, but it does not perform any operation because we don't have an easy way to add hours to a Date only (we can only use `bump` in conjunction with `DateTime`). If no bump is provided, it defaults to 3 hours. We then throw an error if the function receives a `Date` type.","status":200,"tokens":[0,254],"elapsed":1.956772231,"_type":"aimessage"}]
