[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia function named `timezone_bumper` that solves the problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)\n    if typeof(dt) == Date\n        error(\"Cannot bump time of date.\")\n    elseif typeof(dt) != DateTime\n        error(\"Invalid type. Only DateTime and Date types are supported.\")\n    end\n    \n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nYou can use the function by passing a `DateTime` object as the first argument, with an optional second argument specifying the number of hours to bump (defaults to 3 if not specified). For example:\n\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023,4,10,12,0),3) # outputs DateTime 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n```\nNote that `typeof` is used to check the type of a variable in Julia. If the passed argument is not a `DateTime`, an error message will be printed, indicating that only DateTime and Date types are supported.","status":200,"tokens":[0,256],"elapsed":1.983279616,"_type":"aimessage"}]
