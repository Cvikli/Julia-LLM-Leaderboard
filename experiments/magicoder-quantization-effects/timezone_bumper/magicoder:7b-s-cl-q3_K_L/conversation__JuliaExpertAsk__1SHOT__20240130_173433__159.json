If it's not, an error is thrown. Then, the time `dt` is increased by `bump` hours.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(2019, 1, 1, 8)   # January 1st, 2019 at 8 am\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt)  # bumps it by default of 3 hours => February 1st, 2019 at 11 pm\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,221],"elapsed":1.79930438,"_type":"aimessage"}]
