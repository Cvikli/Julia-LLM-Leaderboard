Please provide a DateTime object.\"))\n    end\n    \n    dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nIn this function `timezone_bumper`, we first check the data type of the input. If it's not `DateTime` (i.e., it is `Date`), then an error will be thrown with a message stating that invalid argument was provided, and should be DateTime object.\n\nIf the date time object is valid, then we simply return the datetime object shifted by the number of hours specified in the bump argument. If no second argument was passed, it defaults to `3`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,191],"elapsed":1.52493481,"_type":"aimessage"}]
