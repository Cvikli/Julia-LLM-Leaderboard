If the bump argument is not provided, it defaults to 3.\n\nThe `Hour(bump)` part of code increases the given datetime object by `bump` hours.\n\nIf you try to pass a Date type instead, Julia will throw an error because Date and DateTime are different types in Dates package of Julia.\n\n```julia\nprintln(timezone_bumber(Dates.today())) # It will throw an error\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,214],"elapsed":1.73482227,"_type":"aimessage"}]
