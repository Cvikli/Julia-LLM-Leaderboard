You have provided Date.\"))\n    end\n    dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nHere is how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\n# Providing DateTime\ndt = DateTime(2021, 7, 20, 18, 30)\nnew_time = timezone_bumper(dt, 4) # Increase the provided timestamp by 4 hours.\nprintln(new_time)\n```\n\nThis function works with a DateTime type and throws an error when you provide it with a Date type. It also allows for optional parameter `bump`, which defaults to `3`.\n\nPlease note, the function does not actually modify the input datetime but returns a new one that is bumped by `bump` hours. If you need to modify the original datetime in-place you would have to create separate function to handle this scenario.","status":200,"tokens":[0,261],"elapsed":2.157018749,"_type":"aimessage"}]
