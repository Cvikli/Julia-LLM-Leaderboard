If it is not a `DateTime` type, then an error will be thrown. Otherwise, the time `dt` will be increased by `bump` hours and returned as the result.\n\nPlease note that this function does not consider timezone shifts if the bump is applied in different timezone than the input datetime. If you need to handle this case you would have to include some additional logic that takes into account the timezone of the input datetime.","status":200,"tokens":[0,207],"elapsed":1.675969313,"_type":"aimessage"}]
