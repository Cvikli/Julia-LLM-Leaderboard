If it's not, then an error is thrown. If the input is valid, then the function increases the time by bump hours and returns the new time. \nThe example testing line shows how to use this function with a specific date-time value along with a bump amount, and also without any bump amount, defaults to `3`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,269],"elapsed":2.212252336,"_type":"aimessage"}]
