If a second argument is not provided, it defaults to 3. The function first checks if the input type is `Date`, and if so, throws an error because this function should only work with `DateTime`.\n\nIf the input type is indeed `DateTime`, the function then adds the number of hours specified by `bump` to the original date-time object and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,189],"elapsed":1.540512025,"_type":"aimessage"}]
