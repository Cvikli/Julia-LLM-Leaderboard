The default value of bump is set to 3. The function then adds the number of hours specified by bump to the original time, and returns the new time. If it receives something other than a DateTime object, it will throw an error message saying \"Function only works for DateTime types.\"\n\nThe testing part uses `now()` to get the current date/time. It then attempts to apply the function with this time and a bump of 10 hours. If successful, it prints out the new time; if not (for example, if the input was a Date type), it catches the error and displays an appropriate message.","status":200,"tokens":[0,277],"elapsed":3.093390443,"_type":"aimessage"}]
