[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

Please provide a DateTime.\")\nend\n```\n\nIn the function `timezone_bumper`, we take a `DateTime` object as an input and return it shifted by a specified number of hours (defaults to 3). If a `Date` object is provided, we throw an error because timezone manipulation makes no sense for dates that do not have a time component.\n\nThe special instructions would be integrated within the function. For example, if you wanted to ensure that the date was in UTC before shifting it by hours, you could modify the function like this:\n```julia\nusing Dates: UTC\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump::Int=3) \n    dt = convert(DateTime, dt)   # ensure DateTime type\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(d::Date)\n    error(\"Provided date is not a DateTime type.
