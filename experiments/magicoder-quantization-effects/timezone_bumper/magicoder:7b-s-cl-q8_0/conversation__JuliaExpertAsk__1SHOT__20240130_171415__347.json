Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can achieve this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump=3)\n    if bump < 0 || bump > 23\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"bump must be between 0 and 23\"))\n    end\n    \n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nThis function accepts a DateTime object (`dt`) and an optional bump value (defaults to 3 hours if not provided). It first checks if the bump value is valid (i.e., between 0 and 23). If it's not, it throws an ArgumentError with an appropriate message.\n\nIf the bump value is valid, it uses the + operator on `dt` to add a time duration equal to `bump` hours. The `Hour` function from the Dates module in Julia creates a new TimePeriod instance representing exactly one hour, which can be added to any DateTime object.\n\nNote that this function doesn't check if `dt` is actually a DateTime object or not. If it's not a DateTime type, you will get an error when trying to call the + operator because DateTime and Date types are different. For example:\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(Date(2021, 7, 30))\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,305],"elapsed":3.428397035,"_type":"aimessage"}]
