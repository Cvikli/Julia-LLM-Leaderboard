[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can create a function with the following syntax:\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)\n    # Your code here\nend\n```\nHere, `::` is used to specify that dt should be of type DateTime. \nThe keyword argument `bump=3` allows the function to accept an optional integer input for bumping the time. If no value is provided for bump, it will default to 3 hours.\n\nWithin the function, you can use the built-in `hour()` function to get the current hour of a DateTime object and then add bump hours. However, DateTime objects in Julia do not have an \"add hours\" method directly. Therefore, we will convert the DateTime into a Duration object using `TimeZone` package first before adding hours. \n\n```julia\nusing TimeZones\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)\n    if typeof(dt) == Date\n        error(\"Input should be of type DateTime, not Date.\")\n    end\n    \n    dt += Duration(hours=bump)\nend\n```\n\nPlease install the TimeZone package before running it by typing `] add TimeZones` in Julia's REPL. This will throw an error if a Date object is passed to the function, because it cannot be added hours like a DateTime object.","status":200,"tokens":[0,308],"elapsed":3.504321983,"_type":"aimessage"}]
