[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

If no value is provided for `bump`, it defaults to 3 hours. The function then returns a new datetime that has been bumped by the given amount of hours.\n\nIf a Date type is passed to the function, it will throw an ArgumentError, indicating that the input must be DateTime type. This is because DateTime in Julia is timezone aware while Date is not. \n\nTo test the function:\n```julia\ndt = now()  # Get current datetime\nbumped_datetime = timezone_bumper(dt)\nprintln(\"Bumped Datetime: \", bumped_datetime)\n\nbumped_by_3_hours = timezone_bumper(dt,3)\nprintln(\"Datetime after bumping by 3 hours: \", bumped_by_3_hours)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,286],"elapsed":3.248526016,"_type":"aimessage"}]
