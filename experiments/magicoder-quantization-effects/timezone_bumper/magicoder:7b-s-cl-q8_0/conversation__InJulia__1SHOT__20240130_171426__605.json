Here is how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(d::Date) \n    error(\"Provided argument is a Date, not a DateTime. Please provide a DateTime.\")\nend\n```\nIn the above code, `DateTime` type has been used to increase the timestamp by default or by `bump` hours if provided, while `Date` type throws an error because it can't be manipulated in the same way as `DateTime`. This function will work for any DateTime types and throw an error for Date.","status":200,"tokens":[0,191],"elapsed":2.122529243,"_type":"aimessage"}]
