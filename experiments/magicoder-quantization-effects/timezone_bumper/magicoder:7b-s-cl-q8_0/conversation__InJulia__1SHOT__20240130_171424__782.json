The function checks whether the input `dt` is a DateTime type or not. If it's not, then an ArgumentError with a message \"Only DateTime type is supported\" is thrown. Finally, if `dt` is a valid DateTime object, it's increased by the number of hours specified in `bump`. The resulting DateTime object is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,169],"elapsed":1.875405693,"_type":"aimessage"}]
