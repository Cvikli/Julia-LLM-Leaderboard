Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, we can write a function like the following:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump = 3)\n    if typeof(dt) != DateTime \n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be of type DateTime\"))\n    end\n    \n    dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nIn this code, we have a function `timezone_bumper` that takes in a DateTime object (`dt`) and an optional argument bump. If the input is not a DateTime object, it throws an error. Otherwise, it returns the DateTime object `dt` increased by `bump` hours. \n\nHere, the `Hour(bump)` function from the Dates library is used to add or subtract hours from a date-time. This function belongs to Dates.TimePeriod and takes in a number (bump). The TimePeriod stores the duration as an integer of seconds and it uses the `+` operator for addition.\n\nYou can call this function with a DateTime object like so: \n```julia\ndt = now() # get current time\nnew_time = timezone_bumper(dt,4) # bump current time by 4 hours\n```\nRemember to run `using Dates` at the beginning of your code to import the Dates module.","status":200,"tokens":[73,292],"elapsed":2.561579145,"_type":"aimessage"}]
