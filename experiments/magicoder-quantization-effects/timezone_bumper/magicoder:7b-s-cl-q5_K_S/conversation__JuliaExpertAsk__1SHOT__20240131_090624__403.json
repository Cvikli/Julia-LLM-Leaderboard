It checks if the input is of type `DateTime`. If not, it throws an error. Otherwise, it adds the number of hours specified by `bump` to the DateTime object and returns the result.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\ndt = now() # Get current date-time\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt) \n# or with a different bump value\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, 5)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,213],"elapsed":1.830768594,"_type":"aimessage"}]
