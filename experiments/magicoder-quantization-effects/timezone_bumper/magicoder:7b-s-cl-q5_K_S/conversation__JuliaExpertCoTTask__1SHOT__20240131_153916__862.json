The function `timezone_bumber` takes a DateTime object and an optional bump value (default is 3). It checks if the input type is DateTime, if not it throws an error. If it is of correct type, it adds the specified number of hours to the time.","status":200,"tokens":[0,189],"elapsed":1.63604983,"_type":"aimessage"}]
