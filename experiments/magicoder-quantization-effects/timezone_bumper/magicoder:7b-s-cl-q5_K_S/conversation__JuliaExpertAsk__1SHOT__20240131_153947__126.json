If it's not, an error will be thrown. If it is, then we add `bump * 60 * 60` seconds (because one hour in seconds is 3600) to the timestamp and return the result.\n\nYou can call this function with a DateTime type like so:\n```julia\ndt = now() # get current time\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, 5) # bump by 5 hours\nprintln(bumped_dt)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,230],"elapsed":1.97077444,"_type":"aimessage"}]
