By default, it adds 3 hours but this can be changed when calling the function. If you try to pass a Date type instead of a DateTime, Julia will throw an error because Date and DateTime are different types in Julia's Dates module.","status":200,"tokens":[0,163],"elapsed":1.401297814,"_type":"aimessage"}]
