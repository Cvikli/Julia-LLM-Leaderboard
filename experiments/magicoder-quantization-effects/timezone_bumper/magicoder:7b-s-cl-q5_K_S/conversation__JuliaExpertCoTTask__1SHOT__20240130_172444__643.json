Here is how you could write your function:\n```julia\nusing Dates # Import the Dates module for dealing with dates and times\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump = 3)\n    # Check if dt is a DateTime type\n    if !isa(dt, DateTime)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be of DateTime type\"))\n    end\n    \n    # Convert the DateTime to UTC and add the bump hours\n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nThe function `timezone_bumper` takes a `DateTime` as an argument, checks if it is actually of type `DateTime`, and then adds a number of hours (defaulting to 3) to the DateTime. \n\nYou can use this function with your example like so:\n```julia\nt = DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)\nbump_time = timezone_bumper(t) # Returns 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,276],"elapsed":2.386166027,"_type":"aimessage"}]
