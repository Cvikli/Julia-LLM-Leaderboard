[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that fits your description:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump=3)\n    # Check if the input is a DateTime type\n    @assert dt isa DateTime \"Input needs to be of DateTime type\"\n\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nThis function takes in two arguments: `dt` which is the timestamp, and `bump` (defaults to 3), which is the number of hours to add. It checks that the input `dt` is a DateTime type. If it's not, an error message will be thrown with the assertion `@assert dt isa DateTime \"Input needs to be of DateTime type\"`.\n\nIf the `bump` argument isn't provided when calling the function (i.e., if the user only wants to increase the timestamp by 3 hours), it defaults to 3, as specified in the problem statement.\n\nFor example, you could call this function with a DateTime type input like so:\n```julia\ndt = Date(2021, 1, 1)\nbump_time = timezone_bumper(dt)\nprintln(\"The time after bumping is $bump_time\")\n```\nThis will output the timestamp increased by 3 hours.","status":200,"tokens":[0,294],"elapsed":2.636768139,"_type":"aimessage"}]
