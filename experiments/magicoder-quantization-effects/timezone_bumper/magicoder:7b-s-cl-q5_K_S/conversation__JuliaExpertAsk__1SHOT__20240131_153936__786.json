The second argument is an optional integer that defaults to 3. It adds the number of hours specified by the bump parameter to the provided DateTime and returns it. If you try to pass a Date instead, Julia will throw an error because the function does not accept a Date type.","status":200,"tokens":[0,174],"elapsed":1.489662644,"_type":"aimessage"}]
