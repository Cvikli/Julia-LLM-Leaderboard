It checks if the type of `dt` is a Date or DateTime. If it's a Date, it throws an error. Otherwise, it adds `bump` hours to `dt`.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\ndt = now()\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[103,204],"elapsed":1.784134495,"_type":"aimessage"}]
