If no `bump` is provided, it defaults to 3. It checks if the input is indeed a `DateTime` type. If not, it throws an error. Otherwise, it adds the number of hours specified by `bump` to the date-time object and returns the new date-time object.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\njulia> timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)\n2023-04-10T15:00:00\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,233],"elapsed":2.019880509,"_type":"aimessage"}]
