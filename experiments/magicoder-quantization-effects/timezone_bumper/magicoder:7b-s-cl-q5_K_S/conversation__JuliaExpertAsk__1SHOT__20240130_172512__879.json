The function `timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)` takes a DateTime type as an argument, adds the amount of hours specified by `bump` to it, and returns the result. If no value is provided for `bump`, it defaults to 3 hours.\n\nIf you try to call this function with a Date instead of a DateTime, Julia will throw a MethodError because the method `timezone_bumper(dt::Date; bump=3)` does not exist. We can ensure that only DateTime values are used by modifying the function as follows:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)\n    return dt+Hour(bump)\nend\n\ndt = Date(\"2022-10-10\") # Example date, won't work because Dates.jl does not support dates\nbump_time = timezone_bumper(dt, 2) # Julia will throw an error here\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,354],"elapsed":3.069619471,"_type":"aimessage"}]
