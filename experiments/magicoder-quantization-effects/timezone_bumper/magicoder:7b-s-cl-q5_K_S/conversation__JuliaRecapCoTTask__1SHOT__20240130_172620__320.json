[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

Use `import Dates` for date and time operations in Julia.\n2. The `DateTime` type is a struct defined in the Dates module of the standard library. It represents dates with times. \n3. Create function named `timezone_bumper` that takes one argument - `dt`, which should be of type DateTime. By default, it will add 3 hours to the provided date time object.\n4. The `Hour(bump)` operation increases or decreases the hour part by specified number in bump.\n5. The function checks if the `dt` is an instance of Date. If yes, then it throws an error. This makes sure that this function only works with DateTime types and not with Date types.","status":200,"tokens":[0,249],"elapsed":2.190149785,"_type":"aimessage"}]
