If the input is not a `DateTime`, it throws an error. Otherwise, it increases the time of the provided timestamp by the specified number of hours and returns the result. Note that the `Hour` function from the Dates module in Julia is used to add hours to the DateTime object.","status":200,"tokens":[0,169],"elapsed":1.4441773,"_type":"aimessage"}]
