If it's not a DateTime, an error message will be thrown.\n- The function `timezone_bumper()` takes a DateTime as its first argument (`dt::DateTime`) and an optional second argument that specifies how many hours to bump (defaulting to 3 if no value is provided; `bump = 3`).\n- `Hour(bump)` increments the datetime by the specified number of hours.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(\"2022-10-31T12:00:00\") # example date and time\nbumped_time = timezone_bumper(dt)  # bumps the time by 3 hours (default)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,308],"elapsed":2.720178531,"_type":"aimessage"}]
