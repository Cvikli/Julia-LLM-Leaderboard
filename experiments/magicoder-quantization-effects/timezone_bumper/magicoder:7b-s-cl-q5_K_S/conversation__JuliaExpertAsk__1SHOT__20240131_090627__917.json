It checks if the provided input is of type `DateTime`, if not it throws an error. If the input is valid, it increases the time by `bump` hours.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\ndt = now() # get current date and time\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt) # bump the time by 3 hours\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,189],"elapsed":1.627726458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
