If it's not, an error is thrown. \n\nIf `dt` is indeed a `DateTime`, the function increases that timestamp by `bump` hours and returns the result. By default, if no `bump` value is provided, it will add 3 hours to the timestamp.","status":200,"tokens":[0,172],"elapsed":1.463149972,"_type":"aimessage"}]
