Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia code:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump::Int=3)\n    if typeof(dt) == Date\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Provided argument must be a DateTime type, not a Date type\"))\n    end\n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nThis function will work as follows: \n- It takes two arguments: `dt` which is the date/time to be bumped and `bump` which defaults to 3 hours, but can be increased or decreased according to need.\n- The `typeof(dt)` function checks if the provided argument is of type DateTime. If it is not, an error will be thrown stating \"Provided argument must be a DateTime type, not a Date type\".\n- If the check passes, the function simply adds the number of hours specified by `bump` to the input date/time and returns this new value. \n\nIt's important to note that the Dates module is imported at the top of this code snippet because it contains functions related to date manipulation in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[0,255],"elapsed":2.176143893,"_type":"aimessage"}]
