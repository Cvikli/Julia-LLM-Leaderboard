[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

First, let's suppose that the DataFrame is named df and it has a column named \"dt\" of DateTime type. The task can be implemented as follows:\n\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    function extract_year_and_month(dt::DateTime)\n        year = Dates.year(dt)\n        month = Dates.month(dt)\n        100*year + month\n    end\n\n    df[:, :ym] = map(extract_year_and_month, df.dt)\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThe function `add_yearmonth` takes a DataFrame and adds a new column \"ym\" with the year and month combined as an integer. The helper function `extract_year_and_month` is used to get each year and month separately from the DateTime object, multiply them by 100 (to place them in the correct digit positions), and then add them together.\n\nIn the main body of `add_yearmonth`, we apply this function to all elements in the \"dt\" column using the map function, and store the results back into the new \"ym\" column. Then we return the modified DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,276],"elapsed":2.142012717,"_type":"aimessage"}]
