This code assumes that you have already installed DataFrames.jl via Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\") and imported it into your script with using DataFrames. \n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = Int64[]\n    for row in eachrow(df)\n        dt = row[Symbol(\"dt\")]\n        push!(df[:ym], Dates.year(dt)*100 + Dates.month(dt))\n    end\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function iterates through each row of the DataFrame and extracts the year and month from the DateTime value in the `dt` column, then concatenates them together as an integer in format “yyyymm”. The result is stored in a new column `ym`.\n\nYou can use this function on your DataFrame like so:\n```julia\ndf = add_yearmonth(yourDataFrame)\n```\nPlease replace \"yourDataFrame\" with the name of your DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,249],"elapsed":2.127640067,"_type":"aimessage"}]
