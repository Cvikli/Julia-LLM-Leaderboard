[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

We will use the DataFrames package for working with dataframes, and Dates package for extracting date information from DateTime objects.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(d -> year(d)*100 + month(d), df[:dt])\nend\n```\n\nThis function maps the `add_yearmonth` function to every element in the DateTime column and stores it back into a new ym column. The function extracts the year and month from each DateTime object, multiplies them together (since concatenation is not possible with DateTime types), and adds them up. \n\nIn case there are any special instructions provided, please provide these to improve the code further, but keep in mind that Julia's type system is strong and will generally guide you towards writing more efficient and clear code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,207],"elapsed":1.803669125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
