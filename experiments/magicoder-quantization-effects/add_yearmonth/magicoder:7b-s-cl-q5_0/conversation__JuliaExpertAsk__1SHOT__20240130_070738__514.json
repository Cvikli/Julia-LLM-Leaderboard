The `year()` and `month()` functions are used to extract the year and month from a DateTime, respectively. These values are then combined with integer multiplication and addition to form the desired \"yyyymm\" format.\n  \nNote: This function assumes that your dataframe has at least one row (`df` is not empty). If it's possible for `df` to be empty, you might want to add some error checking code before trying to access `dt`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,204],"elapsed":1.756062767,"_type":"aimessage"}]
