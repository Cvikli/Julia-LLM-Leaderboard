Below I will show you how to solve this problem by writing a function named `add_yearmonth`:\n\nFirstly, we need to import the necessary packages:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n```\nThen, we define our function as follows:\n\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)::Nothing\n    df[:ym] = Dates.format.(df[Symbol(\"dt\")], \"yyyyMM\")\nend\n```\nThis function takes in a DataFrame and adds a new column (`ym`) to it, with the values being string representations of the date in the format `yyyymm`.\n\nNow you can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=Dates.Date[Dates.today()-Month(x) for x in 1:5])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\ndisplay(df)\n```\nThis will display your dataframe with the new column `ym` containing the year and month in string format.\n\nNote that this function modifies the original DataFrame in place. If you want to keep the original DataFrame unchanged, use a copy of the DataFrame:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=Dates.Date[Dates.today()-Month(x) for x in 1:5])\ndf_copy = copy(df) # creating a copy to preserve original dataframe\nadd_yearmonth(df_copy)\ndisplay(df_copy)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[112,362],"elapsed":2.870028802,"_type":"aimessage"}]
