It then creates a new column `ym` that concatenates these two values into the format “yyyymm”. The resulting integer is added to the DataFrame.\n\nNow you can call the function on your DataFrame:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThe resulting DataFrame would look something like this:\n\n| dt                   | ym |\n|----------------------|----|\n| 2020-05-24T00:00:00 | 202005 |\n| 2021-01-15T00:00:00 | 202101 |\n| 2022-12-05T00:00:00 | 202212 |","status":200,"tokens":[0,361],"elapsed":2.80828483,"_type":"aimessage"}]
