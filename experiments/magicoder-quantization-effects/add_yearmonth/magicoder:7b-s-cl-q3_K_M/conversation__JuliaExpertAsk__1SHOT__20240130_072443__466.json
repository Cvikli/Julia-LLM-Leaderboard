The extracted values are then concatenated together as an integer with the format “yyyymm”. \n\nTo use this function on your DataFrame `df`, you would call:\n```julia\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis function modifies the original DataFrame `df` in-place, adding a new column `ym`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,222],"elapsed":1.744563352,"_type":"aimessage"}]
