Note that the DataFrame package is also required for this task. \n\nFirst, let's import both of these packages.\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n```\nThen we can define our function:\n\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = Dates.format.(df[:dt], \"yyyymm\")\n    return df\nend\n```\nThis function takes a DataFrame and adds a new column `ym` to it, with the value in each row being the year-month string of the corresponding date in `dt`. \n\nHere's how you would use this function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\ndf = DataFrame(dt=Dates.Date[Dates.Date(2020,1,1):Dates.Month(1):Dates.Date(2020,12,31)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will create a new column `ym` in your DataFrame with the format \"yyyymm\" of dates in the `dt` column.","status":200,"tokens":[0,269],"elapsed":2.11248979,"_type":"aimessage"}]
