[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes. Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map((dt)->Dates.format(dt, \"yyyymm\"), df.dt)\n    return df\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nIn the above code we define a function `add_yearmonth` that takes a DataFrame as input. Inside this function, we add a new column to our DataFrame. We use the map function along with `Dates.format` function to extract year and month from DateTime and then concatenate them together in string format \"yyyymm\". The result is a vector of strings where each string represents the date in the \"yyyymm\" format. Finally, we return our updated DataFrame.\n\nTo run this code you should have installed Julia and also packages `DataFrames` and `Dates`. If not already installed, you can add them using Package Manager by pressing `]` key in your Julia REPL then type `add DataFrames Dates` and hit Enter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,300],"elapsed":2.42717021,"_type":"aimessage"}]
