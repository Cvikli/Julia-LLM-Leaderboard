Firstly, we need to load Pkg, DataFrames, Dates libraries. Then, define a function `add_yearmonth`:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = [string(year(d), lpad(month(d), 2, '0')) for d in df.dt]\nend\n```\nIn this function, `lpad` is used to ensure that the month part of the date is always two digits long by padding it with a leading zero if necessary. Then, we create a new column `ym` in the DataFrame and populate it using the list comprehension, which extracts the year and month from each DateTime value in `dt` and concatenates them into the desired format \"yyyymm\".\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt = [DateTime(2019, 4, 5), DateTime(2020, 3, 28)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,251],"elapsed":2.002705907,"_type":"aimessage"}]
