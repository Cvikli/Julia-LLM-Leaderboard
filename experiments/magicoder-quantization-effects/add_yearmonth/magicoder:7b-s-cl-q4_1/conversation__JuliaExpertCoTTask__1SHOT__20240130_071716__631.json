Here is the solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\n# Function to add new column for year and month\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(x -> DateTimeFormat.format(\"yyyymm\")(x), df[:dt])\nend\n\n# Given data frame\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\n\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis script first defines a function `add_yearmonth` that takes in a DataFrame and adds a new column \"ym\" by extracting the year and month from the datetime values. \n\nThen we create a sample dataframe `df`.\n\nFinally, we call our function with our `df` as input to add the new column \"ym\". The result will be printed at the end of this script.","status":200,"tokens":[0,232],"elapsed":1.876723228,"_type":"aimessage"}]
