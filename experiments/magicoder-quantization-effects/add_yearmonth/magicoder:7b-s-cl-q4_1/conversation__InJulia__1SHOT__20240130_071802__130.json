Here is a function that does this:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = [string(year(t),lpad(month(t),2,\"0\")) for t in df[:dt]]\n    return df\nend\n```\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df` as an input and returns a new DataFrame with a new column `ym` which is the concatenation of year and month. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each date in the `dt` column, extracts the year and month using the `year` and `month` functions respectively, converts them into strings by calling `string`, then joins them together with `lpad` function which pads a string on the left side with zeros until it reaches the required length.","status":200,"tokens":[0,225],"elapsed":1.794088166,"_type":"aimessage"}]
