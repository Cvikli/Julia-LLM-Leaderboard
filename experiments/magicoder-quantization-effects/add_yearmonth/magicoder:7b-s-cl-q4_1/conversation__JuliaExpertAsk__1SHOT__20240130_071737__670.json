Note, you need to have DataFrames.jl installed in your environment for the following code to work properly:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(x -> Dates.format(x, \"yyyymm\"), df[:dt])\nend\n```\nIn the function `add_yearmonth`, it takes a DataFrame as an argument and adds a new column `:ym` which contains the year and month from the existing date time column `:dt`. The function uses the map function to iterate over each value in the date-time column, format it as a string in \"yyyymm\" format and store that back in the new column.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=Date[Dates.today(), Dates.now()])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\ndisplay(df)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,226],"elapsed":1.804697979,"_type":"aimessage"}]
