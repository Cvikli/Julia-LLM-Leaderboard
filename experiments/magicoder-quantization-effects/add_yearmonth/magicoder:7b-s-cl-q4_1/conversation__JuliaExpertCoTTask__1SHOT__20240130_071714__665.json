We'll first create the function `add_yearmonth` that extracts year and month from DateTime column `dt`, and then creates a new column `ym`.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(x -> format(x, \"yyyymm\"), df[:dt]) \nend\n```\nYou can call this function with your DataFrame `df` like so: `add_yearmonth(df)`. Now you'll have a new column `ym` in your DataFrame.\n\nPlease note that `format(x, \"yyyymm\")` gives us the DateTime `x` in the format \"yyyymm\". The map function applies this operation to each element of the date-time vector.","status":200,"tokens":[0,186],"elapsed":1.499879483,"_type":"aimessage"}]
