First, make sure to include the necessary packages. Then define your function like so:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(x -> year(x)*100 + month(x), df[:dt])\n    return df\nend\n```\nIn this code, the function `add_yearmonth` takes a DataFrame as input. It creates a new column called `ym` which is equal to the year and month of each date in your DataFrame. The year and month are obtained using the `year` and `month` functions from the Dates package respectively. \n\nThen, you can call this function like so:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=Dates.Date[2000,1,2003,4], x=[1,2,3,4])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,228],"elapsed":1.8166589,"_type":"aimessage"}]
