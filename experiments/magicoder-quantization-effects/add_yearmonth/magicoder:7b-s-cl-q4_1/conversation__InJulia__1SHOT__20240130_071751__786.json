Below is how you could write such function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(x -> format(x, \"yyyymm\"), map(d -> DateFormat.(\"yyyy\")(Year(d)) & DateFormat.(\"mm\")(Month(d)), df[:dt]))\nend\n```\n\nIn this function:\n1. `map` applies a transformation to each element in the column `dt`.\n2. Inside the first `map`, it converts a DateTime object into a string using a custom date format where the year is printed as \"yyyy\" and month as \"mm\".\n3. The second map extracts only the year and month parts of each DateTime and then combines them into a single string, which gives us the desired \"yyyymm\" format.\n4. `df[:ym] = ...` creates a new column in the DataFrame with this computed value for all rows.\n5. The function returns nothing because it modifies `df` in-place.","status":200,"tokens":[0,274],"elapsed":2.191989776,"_type":"aimessage"}]
