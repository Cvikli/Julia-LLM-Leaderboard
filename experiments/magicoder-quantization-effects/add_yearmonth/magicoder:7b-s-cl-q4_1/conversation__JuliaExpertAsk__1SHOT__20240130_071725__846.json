You can use its methods to extract parts of the datetime and convert it into a string. Here is how you could implement the function `add_yearmonth`.\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map((dt)->string(DateTime(dt), \"yyyymm\"), df[:dt])\n    return df\nend\n```\nThis function takes a dataframe as an argument, maps over the column `dt` to extract the year and month using the `DateTime` method. Then it concatenates them into a single string of format `\"yyyymm\"`. The result is stored in a new column `ym` which is added back into the DataFrame.\n\nNote: This function assumes that `df[:dt]` correctly holds DateTimes, and that `df[:ym]` doesn't already hold values that should not be overwritten by this function. If there are other assumptions to check for, you might want to add error checking or additional functionality accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,239],"elapsed":1.907742995,"_type":"aimessage"}]
