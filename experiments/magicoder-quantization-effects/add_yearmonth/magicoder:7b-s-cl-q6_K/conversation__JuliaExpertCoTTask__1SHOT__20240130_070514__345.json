Note that this solution assumes all dates are from the same century and does not account for leap years. If you need to consider those, you would have to use `Year(x).value` instead of `Year(x)`, which gives the year as a number without century (like 2021 instead of 2021).","status":200,"tokens":[0,321],"elapsed":3.079219441,"_type":"aimessage"}]
