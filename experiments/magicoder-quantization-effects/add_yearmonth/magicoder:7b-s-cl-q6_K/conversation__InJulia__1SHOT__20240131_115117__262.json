The expression `[string(d.year, lpad(d.month, 2, '0')) for d in df.dt]` creates an array of strings where each string is the year and two-digit month representation of the corresponding DateTime `d` in `df.dt`.\n\nNote that you need to ensure your DataFrame has a column named `dt` which contains DateTimes. If not, replace `df.dt` with whatever column name or expression you have for those values. Also note that this function modifies the original DataFrame `df` by adding a new column \"ym\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,295],"elapsed":2.812565365,"_type":"aimessage"}]
