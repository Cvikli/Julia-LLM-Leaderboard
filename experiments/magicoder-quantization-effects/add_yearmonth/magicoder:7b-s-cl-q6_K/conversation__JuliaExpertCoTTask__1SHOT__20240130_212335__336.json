The values of this new column are calculated by mapping over each value in the `:dt` column, extracting the year and month from each DateTime, and then concatenating them together into an integer format \"yyyymm\".\n\nYou can use it on your given DataFrame like so:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThis will return a new DataFrame with an additional column `:ym` containing the year and month of each date in \"yyyymm\" format.","status":200,"tokens":[0,265],"elapsed":2.528638225,"_type":"aimessage"}]
