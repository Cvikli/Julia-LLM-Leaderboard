The values in this new column are calculated by multiplying the year of each date with 100 (to shift months to two digits) and adding the month.\n\nYou can use it like:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\ndf = DataFrame(dt = [DateTime(2020,1,1), DateTime(2021,3,4), DateTime(2022,5,6)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThis will add a new column `ym` with values 202001, 202103, and 202205.","status":200,"tokens":[112,244],"elapsed":2.335903923,"_type":"aimessage"}]
