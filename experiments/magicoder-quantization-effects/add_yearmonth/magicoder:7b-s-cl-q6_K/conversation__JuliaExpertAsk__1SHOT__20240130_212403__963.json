The values in this new column are calculated by mapping over the DateTimes in the `dt` column of the DataFrame, extracting the year and month using the `year` and `month` functions from the Dates module, and then concatenating them together.\n\nHere is how you can use it:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt = [DateTime(2021, 1, 2), DateTime(2022, 3, 4), DateTime(2023, 5, 6)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nAfter running this code, `df` will have a new column `ym` with values [202101, 202203, 202305].","status":200,"tokens":[0,259],"elapsed":2.455601231,"_type":"aimessage"}]
