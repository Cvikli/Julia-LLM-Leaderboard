The transformation is done by `Dates.format(x, \"yyyymm\")`, which extracts year and month from DateTimes and formats them as \"yyyyMM\".\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n```julia\n# Assuming df is your DataFrame with DateTime column dt\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nAfter the execution of above code, `df` will have a new column `:ym` which contains year and month in \"yyyymm\" format.","status":200,"tokens":[0,221],"elapsed":2.112411404,"_type":"aimessage"}]
