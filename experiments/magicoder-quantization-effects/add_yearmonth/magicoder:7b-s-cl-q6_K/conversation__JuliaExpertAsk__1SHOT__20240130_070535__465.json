Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you could define the `add_yearmonth` function in Julia. We will use the DataFrames package to work with DataFrame objects and Date and DateTime types for manipulating date-time data.\n\nFirstly, please make sure that you have the DataFrames.jl package installed. If not, you can do so using the Pkg module:\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"DataFrames\")\n```\nHere's how to define your function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map((x)->Date(x).year*100 + Date(x).month, df.dt)\n    return df\nend\n```\nThis function takes a DataFrame as an input and returns the same DataFrame with added column `ym` which contains the year-month value of dates in column `dt`.\n\nThe function uses map to iterate over each date in the `dt` column, extracts the year and month from it, and concatenates them together to form a new integer. Then this integer is assigned as the value for the corresponding row in the `ym` column. \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes your dates are stored as DateTime type and not just Date type.","status":200,"tokens":[0,288],"elapsed":2.723815857,"_type":"aimessage"}]
