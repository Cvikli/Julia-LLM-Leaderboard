Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia solution:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = year.(df[:dt]) * 100 .+ month.(df[:dt])\nend\n```\nThis function works by extracting the year and month from each DateTime in the `dt` column of the dataframe, then combining them into a new integer column (`ym`) by multiplying the year by 100 and adding the month. This effectively creates a \"yyyymm\" format date. The modified dataframe is returned by this function.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=DateTime[Dates.today(), Dates.now()-Month(1), Dates.now()-Year(1)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will add a new column `ym` to the dataframe that contains the year and month of each date. For instance, if today's date is 2021-12-31, one row in this example would have a value of 202112 for the `ym` field.","status":200,"tokens":[112,264],"elapsed":2.524201521,"_type":"aimessage"}]
