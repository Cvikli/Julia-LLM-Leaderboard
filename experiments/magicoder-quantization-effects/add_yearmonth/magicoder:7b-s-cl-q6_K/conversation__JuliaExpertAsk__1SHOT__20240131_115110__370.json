The result is added as a new column named `ym`. \n\nFor example, if you have a dataframe like this:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=DateTime[now()-Month(i) for i in 1:3])\n```\nyou can add the new column with:\n```julia\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThe `ym` column will now contain the year and month of each date, as integers.","status":200,"tokens":[0,217],"elapsed":2.071390237,"_type":"aimessage"}]
