Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution using Julia's DataFrames package:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = [Dates.format(d, \"yyyyMM\") for d in df[:dt]]\n    return df\nend\n```\nThis function `add_yearmonth` takes a DataFrame as input and adds a new column `:ym` to it. The new column contains strings representing the year and month of each date in format \"YYYYMM\". \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that your DateTimes are stored in the standard ISO 8601 format, i.e., `yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM:SS`. If you have a different format, you would need to adjust the format string accordingly when calling `Dates.format`.\n\nAlso note that this function modifies your input DataFrame in place and returns it for convenience. If you want to avoid modifying your original DataFrame, you can make a copy of it before applying this function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,231],"elapsed":2.206040526,"_type":"aimessage"}]
