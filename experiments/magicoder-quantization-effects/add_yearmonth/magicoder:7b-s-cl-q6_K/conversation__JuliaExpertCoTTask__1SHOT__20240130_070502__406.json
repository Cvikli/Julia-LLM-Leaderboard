The `DateTime` type has methods such as `.year`, `.month` that provide the required information. Then we just concatenate these two values into a string format \"yyyymm\" and add this as a new column in the DataFrame. Below is a Julia function that does exactly that:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = [string(DateTime(df[i, :dt]).year * 100 + DateTime(df[i, :dt]).month, length=6) for i in eachindex(df)]\nend\n```\n\nThis function iterates through the DataFrame and uses the `DateTime` method to extract the year and month from each date time object. Then it concatenates these two values into a string \"yyyymm\" format and assigns this value as a new column in the DataFrame.\n\nYou can use the function on your dataframe like so:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThe `DataFrame` will now contain a new column named \"ym\" with values like \"202005\", \"202101\", and \"202212\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,343],"elapsed":3.251635907,"_type":"aimessage"}]
