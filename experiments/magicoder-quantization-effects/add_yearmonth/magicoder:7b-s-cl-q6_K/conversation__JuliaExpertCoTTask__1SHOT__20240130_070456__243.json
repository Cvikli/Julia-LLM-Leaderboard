The `map` function is used with the anonymous function `(x)->Dates.format(x, \"y\") * string(Dates.month(x))` that extracts the year and month from each DateTime in the df[:dt] series and concatenates them as an integer in format: “yyyymm”. The result of the `map` function is assigned to the new column `df[:ym]`.\nThe DataFrame `df` contains three DateTime objects which are passed to the `add_yearmonth` function. After calling this function, we check that the new column `ym` has been correctly added by printing `df`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,308],"elapsed":2.8906264,"_type":"aimessage"}]
