It takes a DataFrame as input, adds a new column `ym`, and fills it with strings that represent the year and month of each date in the original column `dt`. The format is \"yyyyMM\", which is a string representation of the date where \"yyy\" are the last three digits of the year, and \"mm\" are the zero-padded month.\n\nYou can use this function on your DataFrame like so:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThis will return a new DataFrame where `dt` has been replaced with the year-month string in column `ym`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,283],"elapsed":2.730887767,"_type":"aimessage"}]
