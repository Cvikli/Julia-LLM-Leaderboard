It uses the `Dates` module to extract year and month from the DateTimes, converts them to strings and concatenates them together. Note that we use the function `replace` with `join` for better formatting of the resulting integers.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = replace.(string.(year(df[:dt]) * 100 .+ month(df[:dt])), \".\" => \"\") |> x -> parse.(Int64, x)\nend\n```\n\nTesting it:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThis should give you the DataFrame `df` with a new column `ym` that contains the year and month of the original dates in \"yyyymm\" format as integers.
