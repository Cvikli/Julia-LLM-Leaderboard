Inside the function, we create a new column `:ym` by mapping over the `:dt` column of the dataframe using a list comprehension. The `Dates.format` function is used to format each date into \"yyyymm\" string format and then it's converted back to an integer using `[x*1 for x in ...]`.\n\nFinally, we test our function with the provided data.","status":200,"tokens":[0,277],"elapsed":2.679725188,"_type":"aimessage"}]
