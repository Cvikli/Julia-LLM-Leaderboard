It uses the built-in `year` and `month` functions from the `Dates` package to extract these values. The two numbers are then concatenated together with a multiplication by 100 as a separator.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt = [Date(2021,1,1), Date(2022,2,28)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThis will add a new column `ym` to your DataFrame where the first row is 202101 and the second row is 202202.","status":200,"tokens":[0,260],"elapsed":2.482206207,"_type":"aimessage"}]
