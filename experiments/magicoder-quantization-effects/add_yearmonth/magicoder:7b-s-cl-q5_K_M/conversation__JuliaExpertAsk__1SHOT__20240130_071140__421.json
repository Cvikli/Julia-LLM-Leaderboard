The `lpad()` function is used to ensure that single digit months are zero-padded.\n\nPlease make sure you have Pandas library installed in your Julia environment. If not, use `Pkg.add(\"Pandas\")` command to add it. \n\nNote: This solution assumes the `dt` column contains DateTime values and there is no other data type in that column. If there could be non-DateTime values present, you might want to handle that case as well (for example by skipping those rows or replacing them with some default value).","status":200,"tokens":[0,276],"elapsed":2.336616012,"_type":"aimessage"}]
