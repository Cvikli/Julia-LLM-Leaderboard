[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

This function will add a new column to your DataFrame which contains year and month concatenated together as string. \n\nFirstly, let's import necessary packages:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n```\nNext, let's define our `add_yearmonth` function:\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = string.([Dates.year(dt) for dt in df[:dt]], [Dates.month(dt) for dt in df[:dt]]) |> x -> map(x, Int64)\nend\n```\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df` as input and adds a new column `:ym`. The values of this new column are created by mapping the year (from `Dates.year(dt)` for each date-time in the DataFrame) and month (from `Dates.month(dt)` for each date-time in the DataFrame) separately, then concatenating them into a string. \n\nHere, `|> x -> map(x, Int64)` is used to convert those strings back to integers. \n\nFinally, we can use this function like:\n```julia\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will update the DataFrame `df` in-place and add a new column `:ym`.","status":200,"tokens":[382,310],"elapsed":2.838670935,"_type":"aimessage"}]
