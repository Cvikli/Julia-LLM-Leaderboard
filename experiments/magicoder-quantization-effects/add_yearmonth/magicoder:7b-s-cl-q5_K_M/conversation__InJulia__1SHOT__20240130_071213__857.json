If not, run the following commands in your Julia console:\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"DataFrames\")\n```\nThen you can define and use the function `add_yearmonth` as follows:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = Dates.format.(df[:dt], \"yyyyMM\") |> Vector{Int}\nend\n```\nYou can call this function like this: \n```julia\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will add a new column `ym` to your DataFrame, where each element is the year and month (in the format \"yyyymm\") of corresponding `dt`.\n  \nPlease note that you need to replace `df` with your actual DataFrame variable. \n\nIf you encounter any issues or errors during this process, please make sure you have Julia installed and working properly in your system.
