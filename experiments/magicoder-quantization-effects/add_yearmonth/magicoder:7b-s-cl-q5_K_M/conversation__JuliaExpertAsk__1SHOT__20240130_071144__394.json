This function comes with the `Dates` package in Julia.\n- These formatted strings are then concatenated together to form a new column `ym`.\n\nTo use this function, just call it on your DataFrame:\n```julia\ndf = add_yearmonth(df)\n```\nMake sure you have imported the necessary packages and defined your DataFrame before calling this function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,237],"elapsed":2.042831169,"_type":"aimessage"}]
