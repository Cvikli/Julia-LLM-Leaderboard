Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can do it using the Pandas library:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = [Date(dt).year * 100 + Date(dt).month for dt in df.dt]\n    return df\nend\n```\nThis function takes a DataFrame as input and adds a new column `ym` to it. It uses a list comprehension to create this new column by extracting the year and month from each date in `df.dt`, concatenating them into an integer, and then assigning that value to the corresponding row in the new column.\n\nNote: This function assumes that the column 'dt' is already of DateTime type, and will error if it's not. You may want to add checks for this or handle it differently based on your specific needs. \n\nAlso note that the `ym` values are represented as an integer, which means they would sort in ascending order like integers instead of dates. If you need them as strings with format \"yyyy-mm\", you can modify the function to create a new column where each cell is a string, and it will not affect the ordering because strings are compared lexicographically.","status":200,"tokens":[0,272],"elapsed":2.122389857,"_type":"aimessage"}]
