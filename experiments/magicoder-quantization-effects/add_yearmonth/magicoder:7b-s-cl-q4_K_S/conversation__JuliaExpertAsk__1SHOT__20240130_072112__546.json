This is done using the `format` function with a string `\"yyyyMM\"` that specifies the format we want: \"yyyy\" for the 4-digit year, and \"MM\" for the 2-digit month. The result of this operation is then assigned to a new column `:ym`.\n\nTo use the function, you can simply call it with your DataFrame as an argument like so:\n\n```julia\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,220],"elapsed":1.745800981,"_type":"aimessage"}]
