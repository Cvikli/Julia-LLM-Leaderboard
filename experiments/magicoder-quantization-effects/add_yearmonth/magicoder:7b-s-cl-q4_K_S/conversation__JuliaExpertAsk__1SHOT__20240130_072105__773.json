The integers are created by concatenating together the year (which is obtained using `Dates.year(dt)`) and month (obtained from `Dates.month(dt)`), both of which are converted to strings using the `string()` function, then combined into a single integer string with the `join()` function.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=DateTime[])\npush!(df, Dict(:dt => DateTime(\"2021-05-06T00:00:00\")))  # add one row to the df\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n# Output: \n# 3 DataFrame\n# | Row | dt                   | ym    |\n# |-----|----------------------|-------|\n# | 1   | 2021-05-06T00:00:00 | 202105 |\n```","status":200,"tokens":[112,340],"elapsed":2.699203987,"_type":"aimessage"}]
