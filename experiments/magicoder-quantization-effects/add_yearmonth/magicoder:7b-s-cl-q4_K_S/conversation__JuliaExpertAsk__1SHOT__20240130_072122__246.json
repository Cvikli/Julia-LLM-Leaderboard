The `DateFormats.format()` function is used to achieve this. This function is part of the `DateFormats` package which needs to be imported first.\n\nPlease note, you should call this function on your dataframe like so: `add_yearmonth(df)` where `df` is your dataframe variable.","status":200,"tokens":[0,189],"elapsed":1.472167082,"_type":"aimessage"}]
