Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution using Julia programming language:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = string.(getproperty.(Dates.YearMonth(df[:dt]), :year)) * string.(getindex.(100 .+ getproperty.(Dates.Month(df[:dt]), :month), 1:2))\nend\n```\nThis function adds a new column to the DataFrame (`df`) named `ym`. This new column contains the year and month of the DateTime values in `df` concatenated together as integers in format \"yyyymm\". It uses the `Dates.YearMonth` and `Dates.Month` functions to extract the year and month from the DateTimes, respectively. The `getproperty` function is used with a tuple `(:year)` or `(:month)` to get these values as integers.\n\nNote that the \"100 +\" in front of `:month` is added to convert the month integer into two-digit format. This is necessary because the string concatenation operator `*` requires strings on either side. \n\nAlso note that this function modifies the original DataFrame (`df`) by adding a new column. If you do not want to modify the original DataFrame, consider creating a copy of it before calling the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,294],"elapsed":2.313114038,"_type":"aimessage"}]
