The function takes each DateTime object and extracts the year and month, then concatenates them into an integer format \"yyyymm\".\n\nHere is how you can use this function with your provided data:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nAfter running this code, `df` will have a new column named `:ym` that contains the year and month of each DateTime as an integer in \"yyyymm\" format.","status":200,"tokens":[0,247],"elapsed":1.847807038,"_type":"aimessage"}]
