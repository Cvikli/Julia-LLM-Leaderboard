The result is then converted into an array of integers. This new column `ym` is added to the DataFrame `df` by assigning it to `df[:ym]`.\n\nPlease note, this function assumes that your DataFrame `df` already has a column named `:dt`, which holds DateTime objects. If not, you might need to preprocess your DataFrame before calling this function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,206],"elapsed":1.54285899,"_type":"aimessage"}]
