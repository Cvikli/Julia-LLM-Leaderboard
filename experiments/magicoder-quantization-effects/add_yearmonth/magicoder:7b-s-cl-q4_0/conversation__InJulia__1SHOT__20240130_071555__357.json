Here is a simple function that does exactly what you want:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    # Create new column ym \n    df[:ym] = map(x -> year(x)*100 + month(x), df[:dt])\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function goes through each element in the `dt` column of the DataFrame, extracts the year and the month using `year` and `month` functions respectively, and then concatenates them to create a new integer. It uses the map function to apply this operation on every element of the column, creating a new column in the process.\n\nPlease note that if your data frame is not sorted by date, you might want to sort it first, as `year` and `month` functions expect dates to be sorted:\n\n```julia\ndf = add_yearmonth(sort(df, :dt))\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,237],"elapsed":1.776433368,"_type":"aimessage"}]
