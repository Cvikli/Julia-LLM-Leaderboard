We will use DataFrames.jl package to work with dataframes and Dates.jl package to work with date-time objects.\n\nFirstly, we should install required packages if they are not installed yet:\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"DataFrames\")\nPkg.add(\"Dates\")\n```\n\nNow let's define the function `add_yearmonth` and use it on our dataframe:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(x -> Dates.year(x)*100 + Dates.month(x), df[:dt])\n    return df\nend\n\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThe `add_yearmonth` function takes a DataFrame as input and applies a mapping operation across the column dt. The map function applies a function to each element in a collection (in this case, each row of the dataframe). Here, we're applying a custom function that extracts the year and month from a DateTime object and returns them combined into an integer as \"yyyymm\". This new column is then added to the DataFrame.\n\nPlease note that if you want to run this code in your environment, make sure to install the required packages first.","status":200,"tokens":[0,352],"elapsed":2.684246525,"_type":"aimessage"}]
