The transformation is a function that takes a DateTime object, extracts its year and month, multiplies them together, and adds 100 to shift the result into four-digit format for year (yyyy) and month (mm).\n\nThis solution assumes that your DataFrame has other columns as well as `dt` but they are not mentioned in the question. If you have only `dt`, then the function can be simplified by removing the `:id=>[1,2,3]` line from the creation of `df`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,305],"elapsed":2.277697141,"_type":"aimessage"}]
