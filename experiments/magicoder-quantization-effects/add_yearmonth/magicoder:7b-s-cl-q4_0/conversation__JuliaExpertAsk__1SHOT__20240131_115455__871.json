The values in this new column are generated by applying the anonymous function `(dt)->Dates.format(dt,\"yymm\")` to each element of the original `:dt` column. This anonymous function converts each DateTime object into its year and month, separated by a space, as a string. \n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=DateTime[2019,2018,2020], x=[1,2,3])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will create a new DataFrame `df` with an additional column `:ym`. The values in the `:ym` column are \"1902\", \"1801\", and \"2004\" respectively.","status":200,"tokens":[0,271],"elapsed":2.043022837,"_type":"aimessage"}]
