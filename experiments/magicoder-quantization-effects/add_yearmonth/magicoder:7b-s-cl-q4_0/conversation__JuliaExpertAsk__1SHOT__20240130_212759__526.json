Inside this function, it uses the apply method to iterate over each row in the 'dt' column and extracts the year and month from each DateTime using the strftime method of datetime objects. The extracted year and month are then concatenated together into a single string in \"yyyymm\" format. This new string is assigned as the value of the 'ym' column for that row.\n\nFinally, it tests this function on a sample DataFrame with some example DateTime values, prints the resulting DataFrame to verify the correctness of the solution.","status":200,"tokens":[0,293],"elapsed":2.165954493,"_type":"aimessage"}]
