The map function applies the Dates.format method to each element in `dt` column which is of DateTime type, and converts it into \"yyyymm\" format. This function is vectorized meaning it operates on all elements at once, so it's pretty fast.\n\nNote that the DataFrame's : operator can be read as \"apply this transformation to every row in the dataframe\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,251],"elapsed":1.878497388,"_type":"aimessage"}]
