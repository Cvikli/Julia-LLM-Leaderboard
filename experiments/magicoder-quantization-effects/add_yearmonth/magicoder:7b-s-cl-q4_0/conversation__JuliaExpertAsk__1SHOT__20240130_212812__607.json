The value in each row of this new column is the year from the original DateTime (`\"Y\"` format specifier) followed by the month from the same DateTime (`\"m\"` format specifier), both concatenated together without any separator.\n\nFor example, if you have a DataFrame `df` with `dt = [DateTime(2001,1,1), DateTime(2002,2,28)]`, running `add_yearmonth(df)` will add a new column `ym` with values `\"20011\"` and `\"20022\"`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,221],"elapsed":1.63575019,"_type":"aimessage"}]
