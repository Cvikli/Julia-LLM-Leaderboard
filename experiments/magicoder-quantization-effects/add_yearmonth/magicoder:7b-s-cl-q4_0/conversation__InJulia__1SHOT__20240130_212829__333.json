The values in this new column are calculated by mapping over the original column `dt`, extracting the year and month from each DateTime, and then concatenating them together. \n\nNote: This assumes that your DataFrame has a column named \"dt\" which contains DateTime objects. If you have different column names, you will need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,173],"elapsed":1.269951313,"_type":"aimessage"}]
