This function uses the built-in DateTime type from Dates module of Julia standard library, which allows you to extract year and month components from a DateTime object.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map((dt)->Dates.format(dt,\"yyyymm\"), df[:dt])\nend\n```\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df` as input and adds a new column `:ym` to it, which is the concatenation of year and month from each DateTime in `:dt`. It uses the `map` function from DataFrames.jl package to apply a function to every element in the column. The function applied to every element is defined as `(dt)->Dates.format(dt,\"yyyymm\")`, which extracts the year and month components of a DateTime object and formats them into \"yyyymm\" string format.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=DateTime[])\npush!(df, (Date(2021, 3, 1),))\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will add a new column `:ym` to your DataFrame `df`, where the value in this new column is \"202103\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,302],"elapsed":2.239227271,"_type":"aimessage"}]
