Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can use the `Dates` package to manipulate date-time objects. Here is how you can create this function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(x -> Dates.year(x)*100 + Dates.month(x), df[:dt])\n    return df\nend\n```\nThis function takes a `DataFrame` as input and adds a new column \"ym\" to it which is the concatenation of year and month from each DateTime in \"dt\". The `map` function applies a function (in this case, extracting the year and month) to every element in the \"dt\" column.\n\nNote: This assumes that your DataFrame has a column named \"dt\" representing DateTimes. If not, you will need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,195],"elapsed":1.431359492,"_type":"aimessage"}]
