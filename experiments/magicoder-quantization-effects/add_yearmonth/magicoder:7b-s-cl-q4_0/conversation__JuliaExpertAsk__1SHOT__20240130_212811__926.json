The values in this new column are strings representing year-month combinations from the original `:dt` column. \n\nThe `map` function applies the anonymous function `(x -> DateFormat.format(x, \"yyyyMM\"))` to each element of the `:dt` column. This function extracts the year and month from a DateTime object `x`, formats them into a string in the format \"yyyyMM\", and returns this string.\n\nPlease note that you need to have the `DataFrames` and `Dates` packages installed in your Julia environment to run this code.
