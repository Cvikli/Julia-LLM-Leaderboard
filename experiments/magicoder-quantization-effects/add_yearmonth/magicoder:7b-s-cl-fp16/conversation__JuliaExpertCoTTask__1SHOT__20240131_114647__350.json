Here is a function that does what you asked for:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = Int64.(map(x -> year(x)*100 + month(x), df.dt))\n    return df\nend\n\n# Test the function with your data:\n\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis function iterates over each element of the `dt` column and extracts the year and month using the `year` and `month` functions from Dates package. It then creates a new column `ym` with these values concatenated together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.\n\nPlease note that this function modifies the input DataFrame directly, which is not generally recommended in Julia because it can lead to unexpected side effects. If you want to avoid modifying the original DataFrame, you should create a new one and add the result there.","status":200,"tokens":[0,279],"elapsed":4.837172714,"_type":"aimessage"}]
