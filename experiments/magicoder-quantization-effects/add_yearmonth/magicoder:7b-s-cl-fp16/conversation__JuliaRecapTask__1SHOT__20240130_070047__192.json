[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

The resulting strings are then stored in the new `ym` column of the DataFrame. \n\nNote that this solution assumes that your dates are consistently in \"yyyymm\" format, i.e., they are DateTimes (not just regular Integers or Strings), because DateTime objects contain the year and month directly accessible as properties (`.year` and `.month`). If you have dates stored as strings in a different format, you would need to parse them into DateTimes first before extracting the desired information.\n \nAlso note that DataFrames package is not installed by default. You should add it using Pkg module: `Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\")`","status":200,"tokens":[0,270],"elapsed":4.750148439,"_type":"aimessage"}]
