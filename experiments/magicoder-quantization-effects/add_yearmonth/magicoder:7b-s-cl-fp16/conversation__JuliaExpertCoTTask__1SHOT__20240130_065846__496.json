I am using DataFrames.jl library to manipulate dataframes:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = [Date(dt).year * 100 + Date(dt).month for dt in df.dt]\nend\n\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nIn this code, `add_yearmonth` function takes a DataFrame as input. It creates a new column `ym`. In the body of this function, it uses list comprehension to iterate over every DateTime in the `dt` column. For each DateTime, it extracts the year and month using `Date(dt).year` and `Date(dt).month`, respectively. Then it concatenates these two values together by multiplying the year by 100 and adding the month, forming a new integer in \"yyyymm\" format.\n\nThe created function is then used on the given DataFrame to add a new column `ym` with the desired formatting.","status":200,"tokens":[0,286],"elapsed":5.002941459,"_type":"aimessage"}]
