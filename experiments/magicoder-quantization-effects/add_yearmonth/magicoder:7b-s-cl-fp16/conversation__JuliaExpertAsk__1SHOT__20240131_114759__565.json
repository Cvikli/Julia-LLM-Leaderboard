The function extracts the year and month from the DateTime object using the `year` and `month` functions, respectively. These two values are then concatenated into a single integer in the format \"yyyymm\".\n\nPlease note that you need to import necessary packages before running this code. Here, we're importing DataFrames for data manipulation and Dates package for dealing with dates.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=DateTime[now(), now()+Month(2), now()-Day(1)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,236],"elapsed":4.074028905,"_type":"aimessage"}]
