[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

Here's a function that accomplishes this:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(x -> 10000 * Dates.year(x) + Dates.month(x), df[:dt])\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df` as an argument and adds a new column `ym`. The map function applies the lambda expression inside to each element in the dt column. This lambda function extracts the year and month from each DateTime, multiplies them by 10000 to shift the month into four digits (to avoid leading zeroes), then combines them with a simple string concatenation into the desired format \"yyyymm\".\n\nRemember that date-time operations like `year` and `month` are part of the Dates standard library, so make sure you've added it to your project by running `using Dates`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,278],"elapsed":4.935531591,"_type":"aimessage"}]
