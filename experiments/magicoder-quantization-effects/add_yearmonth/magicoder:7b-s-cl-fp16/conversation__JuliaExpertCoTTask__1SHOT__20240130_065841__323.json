Here is how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(x -> Date(x).year * 100 + Date(x).month, df[:dt])\nend\n\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)], dt1=[\"a\",\"b\",\"c\"], :autoindex=>collect(1:3))\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nHere is the explanation of the code above:\n- We define a function `add_yearmonth` that takes a DataFrame as input.\n- Inside this function, we create a new column `:ym` using map and anonymous function to convert each DateTime object in `dt` into an integer. The integer is created by combining year (Date(x).year) and month (Date(x).month), both are extracted from the date time.\n- The result is stored in a new column named 'ym' of the DataFrame.\n- Finally, we create a DataFrame `df` and call our function `add_yearmonth`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,311],"elapsed":5.486291973,"_type":"aimessage"}]
