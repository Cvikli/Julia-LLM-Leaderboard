Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use the `DateTime` functions in Julia to extract the year and month from the DateTimes. Here is how you can implement this function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(x -> Dates.year(x)*100 + Dates.month(x), df.dt)\n    return df\nend\n```\nThis function takes a dataframe `df` as input and creates a new column `ym` which is the concatenated year and month of each DateTime in `dt`. The year and month are extracted using the `year` and `month` functions from Dates package. The resulting value is then multiplied by 100 to ensure two digit representation for both year and month.\n\nYou can use this function on a DataFrame like so:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=DateTime[now()+Month(i) for i in 1:5]) # create sample DataFrame\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nIn the above example, `DataFrame` with 5 rows is created and each row's `dt` column contains current date plus a month from now. The function `add_yearmonth` is then used on this dataframe to add new `ym` column containing year and month of `dt`.","status":200,"tokens":[112,298],"elapsed":5.186196075,"_type":"aimessage"}]
