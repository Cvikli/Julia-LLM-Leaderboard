Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution using the DataFrames package in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = year(df[:dt]) * 100 .+ month(df[:dt])\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, `year` and `month` are functions from the `Dates` package in Julia to extract the year and month components of a DateTime respectively. The new column `ym` is created by multiplying the year by 100 and adding the month. This gives us a two-digit representation of the year and month, which is what we're after.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=DateTime[now() + Month(i) for i in 1:3])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\ndisplay(df)\n```\nThis will create a DataFrame with three rows, each having a DateTime value that is one month from the current date. The `add_yearmonth` function will then add a new column `ym` to this DataFrame, where each row contains an integer representing the year and month in the format yyyymm.\n\nThe `display` function is used here to print out the resulting DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,291],"elapsed":5.02562494,"_type":"aimessage"}]
