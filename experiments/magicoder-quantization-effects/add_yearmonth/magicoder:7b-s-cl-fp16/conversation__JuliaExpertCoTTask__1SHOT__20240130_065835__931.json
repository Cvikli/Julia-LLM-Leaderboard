In this case, it is used with the anonymous function that extracts year and month from DateTime `dt` and then concatenates them together into a string using `Dates.format(dt,\"y\")` for year and `string(Dates.month(dt))` for month. This string is then converted back to an integer as \"yyyymm\" format in the line `df[:ym] = map(...)`.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\ndf = add_yearmonth(df)\n```\nNow `df` will contain an additional column `:ym` with values as `\"20205\", \"20211\", \"202212\"`","status":200,"tokens":[0,335],"elapsed":5.875799938,"_type":"aimessage"}]
