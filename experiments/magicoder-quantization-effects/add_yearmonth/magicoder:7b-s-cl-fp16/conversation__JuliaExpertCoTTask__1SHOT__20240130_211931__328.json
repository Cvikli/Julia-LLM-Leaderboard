The values in this new column are calculated by mapping over each value in the `:dt` column of the DataFrame, extracting the year and month from each DateTime object using `Dates.year()` and `Dates.month()`, respectively, and then concatenating them together as an integer.\n\nYou can use it like so:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will add a new column `:ym` to your DataFrame with the values \"202005\", \"202101\" and \"202212\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,277],"elapsed":4.772153891,"_type":"aimessage"}]
