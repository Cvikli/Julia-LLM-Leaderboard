The function takes a DateTime object and returns an integer representing the year and month combined with a leading zero if necessary (e.g., 2020 becomes 2010, 2021 becomes 2021, etc.).\n\nAfter running this code, `df` will have a new column called `ym` that contains the desired integer values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,271],"elapsed":4.722386628,"_type":"aimessage"}]
