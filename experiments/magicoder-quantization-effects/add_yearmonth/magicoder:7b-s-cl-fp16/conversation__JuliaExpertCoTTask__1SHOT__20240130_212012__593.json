This function extracts the year and month from the DateTime object, multiplies them together (to get a number in the range 100-1200), then adds them together. The result is stored in the new column `ym` of the DataFrame.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will add a new column `ym` to the DataFrame.
