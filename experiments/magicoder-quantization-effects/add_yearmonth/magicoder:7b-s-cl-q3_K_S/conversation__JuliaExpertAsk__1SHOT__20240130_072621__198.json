The format method in the Dates module is used to extract year and month from a DateTime object, concatenating them together as an integer in \"yyyymm\" format. Then these values are stored in a new column `ym` of the dataframe `df`. \n\nThis function modifies the original DataFrame `df`, adding a new column with the calculated date strings. Be aware that this function mutates the passed DataFrame directly, so no return is needed here.","status":200,"tokens":[0,259],"elapsed":2.042151268,"_type":"aimessage"}]
