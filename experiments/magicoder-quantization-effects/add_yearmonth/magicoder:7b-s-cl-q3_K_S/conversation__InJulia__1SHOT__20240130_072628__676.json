Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is the Python code snippet to achieve this in Pandas DataFrame. However, there seems to be no direct way in Julia to manipulate dates like we do with pandas' dt accessor. Thus, here is a simple solution using Dates and DataFrames in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates, DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = [Dates.format(d, \"yyyymm\") for d in df[:dt]]\nend\n```\n\nThis code first imports the necessary packages: `Dates` and `DataFrames`. It then defines a function `add_yearmonth`, which takes as input a DataFrame `df`. For each date-time in column `:dt`, it extracts the year and month and appends them together to create a new column.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrames.DataFrame(dt=Dates.Date[Dates.now()-Month(i) for i in 1:3])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will create a DataFrame with 3 dates in the past (one every month), and then call `add_yearmonth` to add a new column `:ym` containing the year and month of these dates.","status":200,"tokens":[0,289],"elapsed":2.26847824,"_type":"aimessage"}]
