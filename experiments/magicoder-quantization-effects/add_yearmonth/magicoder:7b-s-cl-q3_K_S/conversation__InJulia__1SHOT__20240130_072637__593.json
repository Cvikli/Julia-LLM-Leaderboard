Here's how you could define a function that does what is asked in your problem statement:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(d -> year(d)*100 + month(d), df.dt)\nend\n```\nIn this function, we use the `map` function to apply a function on every element in the column `dt` of the DataFrame `df`. This function extracts the year and month from each date-time using the `year` and `month` functions from the `Dates` module respectively. It then converts these two integers into one integer in the format \"yyyymm\".\n\nTo use this function, you would call it as follows:\n```julia\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,208],"elapsed":1.629496527,"_type":"aimessage"}]
