These values are then concatenated together into a new column \"ym\". This new column \"ym\" will be added to the DataFrame. \n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt = Dates.Date[2000, 2001, 2002]) # Initialize a sample DataFrame with DateTimes\nadd_yearmonth(df) # Add year-month to the DataFrame\n```\n\nThe new column `ym` will be added as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","status":200,"tokens":[0,223],"elapsed":1.751930087,"_type":"aimessage"}]
