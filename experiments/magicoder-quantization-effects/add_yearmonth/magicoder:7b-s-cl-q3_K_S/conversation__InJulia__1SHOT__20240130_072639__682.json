Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia code to create such function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = Dates.format.(df[ :dt], \"yyyyMM\") |> map(x -> parse(Int64, x))\n    return df\nend\n```\nThis function extracts the year and month from each DateTime value in the column `dt`, concatenates them as an integer string in format \"yyyymm\", then parses this new string into an integer. The result is a new DataFrame column `ym` which contains the desired date representation. \n\nNote that if you want to keep leading zeroes for single-digit months or days, the format string would have to be adjusted accordingly. For example \"yyyymm\" would drop any single-digit month values like \"08\", resulting in \"20218\". If you need to preserve leading zeros in this representation, use a more complex format string, such as \"yyyyMM\".\nAlso, please ensure that the necessary packages are included and imported at the beginning of your script.","status":200,"tokens":[0,250],"elapsed":1.959495069,"_type":"aimessage"}]
