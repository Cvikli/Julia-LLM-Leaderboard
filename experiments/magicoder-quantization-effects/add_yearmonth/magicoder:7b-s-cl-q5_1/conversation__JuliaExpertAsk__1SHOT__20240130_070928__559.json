Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is the function you asked for:\n\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    df[:ym] = Dates.format.(Ref(DateTime), df[:dt], \"yyyyMM\") |> collect .|> x -> parse(Int64, string(x))\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df` and creates a new column named 'ym' in the format of \"yyyymm\". The format function is used to extract the year and month from each DateTime value in the 'dt' column. The resulting strings are then joined together, converted to an integer using the parse function and assigned to the 'ym' column in the DataFrame. \n\nHere is how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\ndf = DataFrame(dt = [DateTime(2019,6,1), DateTime(2020,7,30), DateTime(2021,8,15)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nAfter executing this code, `df` will have an additional column 'ym' with the values \"201906\", \"202007\", and \"202108\" respectively.","status":200,"tokens":[0,280],"elapsed":2.502853024,"_type":"aimessage"}]
