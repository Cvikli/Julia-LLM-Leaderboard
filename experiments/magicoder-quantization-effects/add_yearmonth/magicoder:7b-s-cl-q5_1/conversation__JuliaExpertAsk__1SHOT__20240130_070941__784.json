The function `Dates.formatmm\"yyyyMM\"` formats DateTime elements into yyyyMM format. Then we use `|>` operator which is the new-style pipeline operator that allows you to write expressions of the form `x |> f |> g` as `g(f(x))`. \n\nMake sure you've added DataFrames and Dates packages in your Julia environment before running this function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,203],"elapsed":1.82041198,"_type":"aimessage"}]
