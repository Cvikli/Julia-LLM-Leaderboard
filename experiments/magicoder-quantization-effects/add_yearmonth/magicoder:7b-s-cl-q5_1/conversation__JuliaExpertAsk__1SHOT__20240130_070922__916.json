The `.dt.strftime('%Y%m')` method is used for this task where `%Y` represents the full 4 digits year and `%m` stands for month.\n\nThe resulting DataFrame `df` will have an additional column called `ym`. Each value in that column is a string representing the year-month of the corresponding date in the `dt` column.","status":200,"tokens":[112,182],"elapsed":1.652924134,"_type":"aimessage"}]
