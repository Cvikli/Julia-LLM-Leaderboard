[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

This is how you can create the new column:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = [Dates.format(x, \"yyyymm\") for x in eachrow(df)[!, :dt]]\nend\n```\nThe `eachrow` function is used to access rows of the DataFrame as a NamedArray (similar to a DataFrame), from which we can get individual elements. The `[!, :dt]` part extracts the column \"dt\" into an array. The Dates.format function then converts each DateTime in this array to string in format \"yyyymm\".\n\nThis solution assumes that the column dt has already been parsed as a DateTime object. If it's not, you would need to convert it first using `DateTime(x::String)`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,224],"elapsed":2.037853092,"_type":"aimessage"}]
