Here is a simple function that would do exactly what you're asking:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(x -> year(x)*100 + month(x), df.dt)\nend\n\n# Test it out on your data\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nIn this function, `map` function applies a function to every element of an input array. `year` and `month` functions are used to extract year and month from each date time respectively. Then these values are combined into one integer value where year is multiplied by 100 to make sure months always have two digits and added together with the result.\n\nIf you run this code, it will create a new column `ym` in your DataFrame that contains the desired format of each date time as an integer.","status":200,"tokens":[282,268],"elapsed":7.554992746,"_type":"aimessage"}]
