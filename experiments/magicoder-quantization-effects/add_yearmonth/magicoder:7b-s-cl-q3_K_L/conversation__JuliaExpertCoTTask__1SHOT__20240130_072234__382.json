We will use the `Year` and `Month` functions from the DataFramesMeta package in Julia:\n```julia\nusing DataFramesMeta\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    @transform!(df, :ym = Year(x) * 100 + Month(x))\nend\n\n# Testing the function with given data:\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nIn this code, `add_yearmonth` function takes a DataFrame as an argument. Inside the function, it uses `@transform!` macro from the DataFramesMeta package to add a new column \"ym\" to the DataFrame. The value of this new column is derived by multiplying the year (extracted using `Year()`) with 100 and adding the month (extracted using `Month()`).\n\nPlease make sure to install the DataFramesMeta package if it's not already installed in your Julia environment by running `] add DataFramesMeta` in the REPL.","status":200,"tokens":[0,285],"elapsed":2.324200202,"_type":"aimessage"}]
