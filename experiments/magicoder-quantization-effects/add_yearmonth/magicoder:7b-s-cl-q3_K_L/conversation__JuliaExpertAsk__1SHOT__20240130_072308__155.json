This function `add_yearmonth` adds a new column to your dataframe `df` called `ym` which consists of year and month from `dt`.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = Dates.year(df[:dt]) * 10000 + Dates.month(df[:dt])\nend\n```\n\nYou can use it like this:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\n# Suppose df is your DataFrame and dt column contains DateTime values\ndf = DataFrame(dt=DateTime[Dates.now()+Month(i) for i in 1:5])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n\n# Now you have a new column `ym` in df which consists of year and month from `dt`\nprintln(df)\n```\nNote that this code assumes that the DateTime column `dt` is of type DateTime. If your DateTime is stored as String or something else, you will need to convert it into DateTime before processing.","status":200,"tokens":[0,258],"elapsed":2.064544079,"_type":"aimessage"}]
