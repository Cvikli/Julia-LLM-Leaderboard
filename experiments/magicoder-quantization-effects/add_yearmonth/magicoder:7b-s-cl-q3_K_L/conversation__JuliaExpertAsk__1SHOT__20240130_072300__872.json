The result is then assigned back into a new column `:ym`. \n\nAfter defining this function, you can call it on your DataFrame like so:\n```julia\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nPlease make sure that you have `Dates` module imported in your script. If not, please import by using the following command at the beginning of your script: \n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,192],"elapsed":1.531186067,"_type":"aimessage"}]
