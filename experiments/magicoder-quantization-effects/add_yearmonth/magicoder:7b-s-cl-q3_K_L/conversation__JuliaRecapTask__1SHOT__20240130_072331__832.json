[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

The new column is created by applying the function that extracts year (y) and month (m) from each element in `df.dt`, concatenates them together, and converts the result to an integer.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that column dt has DateTime values. If it contains string values that need to be converted to DateTimes first, appropriate parsing should happen before this function is called. Also, the output format \"yyyymm\" does not include leading zeros for years and months less than 10. If you want a different format (e.g., with leading zeroes), you can adjust the formatting string accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[382,248],"elapsed":2.089870377,"_type":"aimessage"}]
