The '%Y%m' argument inside dt.strftime() method specifies that we want the year (%Y) as a 4-digit number and the month (%m) as a 2-digit number. \n\nYou can then use this function like so:\n```python\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'dt': ['2021-05-06', '2022-07-09', '2018-03-14']})\nprint(add_yearmonth(df))\n```\nThis will print: \n```python\n         dt    ym\n0  2021-05-06  202105\n1  2022-07-09  202207\n2  2018-03-14  201803\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,292],"elapsed":2.327604666,"_type":"aimessage"}]
