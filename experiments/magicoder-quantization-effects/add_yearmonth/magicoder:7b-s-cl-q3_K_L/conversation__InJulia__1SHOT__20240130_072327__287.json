This allows you to manipulate data frames. You can do so by adding `Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\")` at the top of your script.\n\nHere is a function that solves the problem:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map((x)->Dates.year(x)*100 + Dates.month(x), df[:dt])\nend\n```\nIn this function, `map` applies a function element-wise to each value in the specified column (`df[:dt]`). The function extracts year and month from the DateTimes and returns their concatenation as an integer.\n\nTo use this function, you would do something like:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates # make sure to import these modules\n\n# assume df is a DataFrame with column dt of type DateTime\nadd_yearmonth(df)  # adds a new column ym to df\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,253],"elapsed":2.018022426,"_type":"aimessage"}]
