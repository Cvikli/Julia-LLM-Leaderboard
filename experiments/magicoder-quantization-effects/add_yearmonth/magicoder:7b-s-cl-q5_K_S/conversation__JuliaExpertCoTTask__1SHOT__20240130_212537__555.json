The function extracts the year and month from the date, multiplies them together (to get a number in the range 2001-2099), then adds 2000 to shift into the range 2001-2099.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThis will add a new column `ym` to the DataFrame.
