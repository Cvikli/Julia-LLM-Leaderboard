Here's how you could write such a function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = [Dates.format(x, \"yyyymm\") for x in df[:dt]]\nend\n```\nIn this function, we iterate over each element in the `dt` column of the DataFrame and use `Dates.format` to convert it into a string in the format \"yyyymm\". This new string is then assigned to the corresponding row in the newly created `ym` column.\n\nPlease note that you need to install the Dates package if it's not already installed, which can be done using:\n```julia\nPkg.add(\"Dates\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[81,193],"elapsed":1.64797212,"_type":"aimessage"}]
