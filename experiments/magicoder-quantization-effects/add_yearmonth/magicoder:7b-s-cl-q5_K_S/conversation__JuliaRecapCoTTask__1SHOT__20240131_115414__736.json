[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

This function will take a DataFrame and add a new column `ym` which is composed of year and month from the DateTime column `dt`.\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(x -> format(x,\"yyyymm\"), df.dt)\nend\n```\nIn this function:\n- We use the `map` function to apply a transformation on each element in the column `dt`. \n- The `format` function is used to convert DateTime into string with desired format \"yyyymm\".\n- This new column `ym` is then added to the DataFrame.\n\nYou can call this function by passing your DataFrame as argument like:\n```julia\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will add a new column `ym` in your DataFrame `df`.\n\nNote: This code assumes that you have already imported all the necessary packages and that your DateTime column is named \"dt\". If these are not true, please modify this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,263],"elapsed":2.276069689,"_type":"aimessage"}]
