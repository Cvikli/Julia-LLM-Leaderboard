Note that you need to have the DataFrames.jl package installed in your Julia environment. You can add it by running `]add DataFrames` in the REPL.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(x -> Dates.format(x, \"yyyymm\"), df[:dt])\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df` as input and adds a new column `ym` to it. The values in this new column are the year-month (in the format yyyymm) extracted from the DateTimes in the `dt` column of the original DataFrame. \n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt = [DateTime(2021, 1, 1), DateTime(2022, 2, 29), DateTime(2023, 3, 31)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nAfter running this code, `df` will have an additional column `ym` with values \"202101\", \"202202\" and \"202303\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,286],"elapsed":2.396044911,"_type":"aimessage"}]
