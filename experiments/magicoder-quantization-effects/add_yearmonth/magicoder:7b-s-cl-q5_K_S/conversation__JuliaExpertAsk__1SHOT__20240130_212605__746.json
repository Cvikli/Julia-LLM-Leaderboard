The `Dates.format` function is used to format these values as strings in the \"yyyyMM\" format. These formatted strings are then concatenated together to form a new integer column `ym`. \n\nPlease note that you need to have DataFrames and Dates packages installed in your Julia environment. You can install them using Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\") and Pkg.add(\"Dates\").","status":200,"tokens":[0,187],"elapsed":1.56651941,"_type":"aimessage"}]
