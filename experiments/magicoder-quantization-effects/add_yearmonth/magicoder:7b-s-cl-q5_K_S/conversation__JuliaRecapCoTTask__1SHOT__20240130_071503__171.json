[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

It applies the function `(x) -> Dates.year(x)*100 + Dates.month(x)` to each element of the column `:dt` and creates a new column with this result.\n- The anonymous function `(x) -> Dates.year(x)*100 + Dates.month(x)` extracts the year and month from `dt` using the Dates.year and Dates.month functions respectively, converts them to integers, and then adds them together.\n\nYou can use this function by calling it with your DataFrame as the argument:\n```julia\ndf = add_yearmonth(df)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,311],"elapsed":2.717150274,"_type":"aimessage"}]
