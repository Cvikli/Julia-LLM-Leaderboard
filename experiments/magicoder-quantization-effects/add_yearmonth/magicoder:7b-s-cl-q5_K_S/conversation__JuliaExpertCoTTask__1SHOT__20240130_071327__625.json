The function `add_yearmonth()` converts each datetime to an integer of the form \"yyyyMM\". For example, for DateTime(2020, 5, 24), it would be 2020505. Note that it will treat the month as zero-padded two digits number (e.g., January would be written as \"01\", February as \"02\" etc.), which aligns with your requirement in the task to represent month as a two digit number.","status":200,"tokens":[0,337],"elapsed":2.936067425,"_type":"aimessage"}]
