Below is an example of how you might define such a function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = Dates.format.(df[:dt], \"yyyymm\")\nend\n```\nThis function takes in a DataFrame and adds a new column `ym` to it where each cell is the year-month string of the corresponding date in `dt`. Here `\"yyyymm\"` is the format string that specifies the output format as \"year\" (yyy) followed by \"month\" (mm).\n\nPlease note, you need to have the DataFrames and Dates packages installed for this function to work. If they are not installed in your Julia environment, you can add them using `Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\")` and `Pkg.add(\"Dates\")`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,209],"elapsed":1.76403489,"_type":"aimessage"}]
