The new column is created using a comprehension that iterates over each DateTime in the `:dt` column of the DataFrame. For each DateTime, it extracts the year and month (with leading zeros for months < 10) using `year` and `month` functions respectively, converts them to strings using `string`, and then concatenates them together into a single string \"yyyyMM\" format.\n\nAfter running this code, you should see that df now includes an additional column `:ym` containing the desired year-month strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,277],"elapsed":2.417881451,"_type":"aimessage"}]
