For each row in the input DataFrame, this function extracts the year and month from the DateTime value in the `:dt` column, concatenates them together into an integer format \"yyyymm\", and stores this value in the newly created `:ym` column.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that your DataFrame has a column named `dt` representing DateTimes and you're using the Julia package `DataFrames`. The DateTime format is assumed to be in the year-month-day order (year first, then month).\n\nNow let's apply this function on our given dataframe.\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will add a new column `:ym` to the DataFrame `df`, with values [20205, 20211, 202212].","status":200,"tokens":[282,321],"elapsed":7.864072162,"_type":"aimessage"}]
