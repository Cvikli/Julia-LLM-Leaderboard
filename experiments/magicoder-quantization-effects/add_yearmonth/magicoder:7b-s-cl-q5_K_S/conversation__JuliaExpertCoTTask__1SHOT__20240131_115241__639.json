Then it uses the bitwise or operator `|>` to convert this into an array of integers. Finally, it converts these integers back to strings with `map(x->parse(Int, x))`.\n\nYou can use the function like so:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThis will add a new column `ym` to your DataFrame with the value \"yyyymm\" for each row.","status":200,"tokens":[0,254],"elapsed":2.167623139,"_type":"aimessage"}]
