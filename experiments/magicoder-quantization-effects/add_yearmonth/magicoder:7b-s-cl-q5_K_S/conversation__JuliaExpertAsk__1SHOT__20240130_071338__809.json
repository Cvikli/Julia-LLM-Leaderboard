Inside the map function, we extract the year and month from each DateTime in the column `dt`. Then, we convert these to integers and concatenate them together to get a format of \"yyyymm\". We use the `convert(Array{Int64}, ...)` function to ensure that the result is an Array of Int64.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\n# assuming df has column dt which represents DateTimes\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThis will add a new column `ym` to your DataFrame, where each element is an integer representing the year and month of the corresponding datetime in \"yyyymm\" format.","status":200,"tokens":[0,265],"elapsed":2.265654596,"_type":"aimessage"}]
