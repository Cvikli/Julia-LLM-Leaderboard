Here's how you can write this function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map((x)-> format(x,\"y\") * format(x,\"m\"), df[:dt]) |> Vector{String}\n    return df\nend\n```\nIn this function, we're using the `map` function to apply a transformation on each element in the column dt of DataFrame df. This transformation is extracting the year and month from the DateTime x and concatenating them together as a String. The resultant Vector{String} column ym is added back into df.\n\nHere, format(\"y\") gives the year part and format(\"m\") gives the month part of the date time. `*` operator is used to concatenate these two parts.","status":200,"tokens":[0,202],"elapsed":1.735569881,"_type":"aimessage"}]
