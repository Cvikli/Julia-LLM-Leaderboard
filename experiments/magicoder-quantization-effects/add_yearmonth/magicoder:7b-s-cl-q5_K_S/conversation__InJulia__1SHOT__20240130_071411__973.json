This package is used to work with data frames, which are two-dimensional arrays of data that have columns and rows.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates # Make sure you have these packages installed by running `] add DataFrames, Dates` in your Julia REPL or in your code\n\n# Function to add a new column for the year-month \nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(x -> DateFormat.format(\"yyyyMM\")(x), df[:dt]) # Uses the DateTime format function to format dt as \"yyyymm\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function will take a DataFrame `df` and add a new column named `:ym` that represents the year and month of each entry in the original `:dt` column.\n\nTo use this function, you would simply pass your DataFrame to it:\n```julia\nadd_yearmonth(df) # df is your DataFrame with the 'dt' column\n``` \nNote: This assumes that `dt` is a DateTime type in your DataFrame and `ym` will be an Integer type.","status":200,"tokens":[0,268],"elapsed":2.327380149,"_type":"aimessage"}]
