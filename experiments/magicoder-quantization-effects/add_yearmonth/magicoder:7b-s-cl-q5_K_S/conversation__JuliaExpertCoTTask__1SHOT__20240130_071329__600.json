The `Dates.format` function is used to format these extracted values as a string in \"yyyymm\" format, and this resultant string is stored in a new column `ym` in your DataFrame.\n\nLet's test it:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nAfter executing this code, your DataFrame `df` will have an additional column called `ym`.
