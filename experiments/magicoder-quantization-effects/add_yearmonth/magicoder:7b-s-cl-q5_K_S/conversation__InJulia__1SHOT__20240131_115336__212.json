Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can use the `Dates` package to manipulate DateTimes. Here is how you can write your function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(x -> Dates.year(x)*100 + Dates.month(x), df[:dt])\n    return df\nend\n```\nIn this function, `map` applies a function to each element in the column `:dt`. The function takes an element of `:dt`, extracts the year and month from it using `Dates.year` and `Dates.month`, concatenates them together (multiplying the year by 100), and assigns this value to the corresponding row in the new column `:ym`.\n\nNote: This function modifies the input DataFrame `df` in place, so it's best not to use it on a DataFrame that you need elsewhere. If you want to keep the original DataFrame intact, make a copy of it before calling this function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,235],"elapsed":1.975952108,"_type":"aimessage"}]
