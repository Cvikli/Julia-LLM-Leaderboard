Here is how you could define such a function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map((dt)->Dates.format(dt,\"yyyymm\"), df[:dt])\nend\n```\nThis function takes in a DataFrame `df` and adds a new column `:ym` to it, which is the year-month value of each entry in the `:dt` column. The `map` function applies this operation for every element in the `:dt` column. \n\nThe format string `\"yyyymm\"` represents the desired output format: \"yyyy\" is the four-digit year and \"mm\" is the two-digit month. \n\nRemember to include any required libraries before using the function. In this case, `DataFrames` for working with data frames and `Dates` for handling dates.","status":200,"tokens":[81,219],"elapsed":2.4209879,"_type":"aimessage"}]
