These are then combined into a new column ym by multiplying the year by 100 (to shift months into two digits) and adding the month.\n\nTo use this function, we can call it on our DataFrame like so:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nAfter running this code, the DataFrame df will have a new column ym with values [\"20205\", \"202101\", \"202212\"]. This represents the date in \"yyyymm\" format.","status":200,"tokens":[282,292],"elapsed":10.275099119,"_type":"aimessage"}]
