It uses the `map` function from the DataFrames package to apply the function `year` and `month` to every element in the `dt` column. The resulting array of year and month values is then concatenated into integers following the format “yyyymm”. This integer is added as a new column, `ym`, to the original DataFrame. \n\nIf you want to add this new column in place (without creating a copy), use `df[:ym] = ...` instead of `df = ...`. \n\nFinally, if the DataFrame already has a column called `ym`, it will be overwritten. If you want to avoid that, ensure that the name is unique or handle the error.","status":200,"tokens":[0,319],"elapsed":3.536045103,"_type":"aimessage"}]
