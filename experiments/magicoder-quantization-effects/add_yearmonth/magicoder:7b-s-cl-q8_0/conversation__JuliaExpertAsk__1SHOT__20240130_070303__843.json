We use the `year` and `month` functions from the Dates package to extract the year and month components respectively, then format them as strings. The \"4\" and \"02\" are formatting strings which ensure that the year has 4 digits and the month is zero-padded with leading zeros if necessary.\n\nNote: This function modifies the original DataFrame in place, adding a new column `ym`. If you want to avoid this, consider creating a copy of your DataFrame before applying this function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,241],"elapsed":2.64574602,"_type":"aimessage"}]
