The function first formats each DateTime using \"yyyymm\" as the format string, then parses the result into an integer.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2021, 5, 1), DateTime(2022, 6, 1)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis would create a new column `ym` in the DataFrame that contains the year and month of each datetime as an integer. For example, for the first row (DateTime(2021, 5, 1)), the value in the `ym` column would be 202105.","status":200,"tokens":[112,271],"elapsed":3.002866432,"_type":"aimessage"}]
