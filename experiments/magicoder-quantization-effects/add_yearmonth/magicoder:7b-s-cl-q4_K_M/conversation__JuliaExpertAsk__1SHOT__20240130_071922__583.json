We define a function `add_yearmonth` that takes in a DataFrame (`df`). Inside the function, we create a new column 'ym'. For each row in the DataFrame, we convert the date-time to an integer of format \"yyyyMM\" using the apply method and lambda functions.\n2. The dates are first converted into datetime objects from strings using pandas' `to_datetime` method. \n3. We then use the `strftime` method which is a string formatting method that returns a string representing the time represented by the time object according to the format specified by the argument.\n4. Inside this, \"%Y%m\" represents the year as \"yyyy\", and month as \"mm\". So when we convert these values into an integer using `int()`, it gives us the year-month in the required format.\n5. This new column 'ym' is then added to the DataFrame. \n6. Finally, we use a simple test DataFrame for this function which contains three dates and call the function to check its output.","status":200,"tokens":[0,375],"elapsed":3.019309042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
