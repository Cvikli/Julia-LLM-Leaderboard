[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

Specifically, we will be using `Dates` package which is part of Julia Standard Library. We can install it by running `]add Dates` in the Pkg REPL mode if not already installed.\n\nHere's how to solve the problem:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates  # make sure you have these packages installed\n\n# Define function add_yearmonth\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map((dt) -> Dates.format(dt, \"yymm\"), df[:dt]) |> Vector{String}\nend\n```\nThis function maps over each value in the column `dt` of a DataFrame and applies the formatting `\"yymm\"` to get the year and month as a string. The result is then used for creating new column `ym`. \n\nNote: If you have dates stored as strings or any other format, you need to convert them into Date before applying above function. For example:\n```julia\ndf[:dt] = map(x -> Date(x), df[:dt]) |> Vector{Date} # assuming x is a date in string format\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,275],"elapsed":2.290470236,"_type":"aimessage"}]
