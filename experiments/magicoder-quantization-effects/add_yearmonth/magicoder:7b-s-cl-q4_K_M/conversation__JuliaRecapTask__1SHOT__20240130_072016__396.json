[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

Inside the function, we add a new column `:ym`. This new column is populated with the year and month of each DateTime in `df.dt`, concatenated together as an integer. \n\nThe function uses Julia's built-in `map` function to apply the anonymous function `(x -> year(x)*100 + month(x))` to each element of `df.dt`. The `year` and `month` functions from Julia's Dates module are used for extracting the year and month respectively.\n\nThis solution assumes that you have already loaded the necessary modules (`DataFrames` and `Dates`). If not, you can add them using the following commands:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nusing Dates\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,249],"elapsed":2.055078792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
