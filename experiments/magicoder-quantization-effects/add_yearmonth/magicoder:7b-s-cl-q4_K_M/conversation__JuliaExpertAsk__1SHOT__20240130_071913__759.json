Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can do this using the DataFrames package in Julia. Note that for this task, the DateTime package is not needed. \n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = Dates.format.(df[:dt], \"yyyymm\") |> Vector{String} .|> x -> parse(Int, x)\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2021, 1, 1), DateTime(2022, 2, 3), DateTime(2023, 3, 4)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Dates.format` function to extract the year and month from each DateTime in your DataFrame. It then concatenates them into a string using \"yyyymm\" as the format specification. The resulting strings are parsed back into integers and stored in the new column `df[:ym]`.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that you have already defined `df` to be a DataFrame with `dt` as DateTime type. If not, please convert your data appropriately before applying the function.","status":200,"tokens":[112,289],"elapsed":2.343907025,"_type":"aimessage"}]
