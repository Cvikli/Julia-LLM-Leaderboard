Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can solve this problem using Julia's DataFrames.jl package:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(x -> Dates.format(x, \"yyyyMM\"), df[:dt]) |> Vector{String}\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df` as input and adds a new column `ym` to it. It uses the `map` function to apply the function `Dates.format(x, \"yyyyMM\")` to each element in the `dt` column of the DataFrame. The result is then converted from an Array{String} back into a Vector{String}, which is assigned to the new column `ym`.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=Date[now()-Month(i) for i in 1:3])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will create a DataFrame with three rows, where the `dt` column contains dates from now back three months. The `add_yearmonth` function is then called on this new DataFrame and it adds a new column `ym` to it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,277],"elapsed":2.204626318,"_type":"aimessage"}]
