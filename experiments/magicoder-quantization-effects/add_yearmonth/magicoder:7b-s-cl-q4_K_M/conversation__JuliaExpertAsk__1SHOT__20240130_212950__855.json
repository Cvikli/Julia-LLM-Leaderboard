The values in this new column are the year and month of each date in `dt`, formatted as \"yyyymm\". \n\nTo use this function, you would first need to import the necessary packages:\n- `using DataFrames`: For working with data frames.\n- `using Dates`: For dealing with dates and times.\n\nThen you can call the function like so:\n```julia\ndf = add_yearmonth(df)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,200],"elapsed":1.571586067,"_type":"aimessage"}]
