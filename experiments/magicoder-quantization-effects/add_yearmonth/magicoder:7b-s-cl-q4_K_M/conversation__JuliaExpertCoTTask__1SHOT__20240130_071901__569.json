It uses the built-in function `format` with the format string `\"yyyyMM\"` to convert each DateTime into a string that represents the year and month. This is then returned as the result of the function.\n\nTo test this function, you can create a DataFrame like so:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will return the DataFrame with an additional column `ym` that contains the year and month of each date in string format.","status":200,"tokens":[0,250],"elapsed":2.022995539,"_type":"aimessage"}]
