The values of this new column are the year and month of each DateTime in `:dt`, concatenated together as an integer string. For example, if the value of `:dt` is \"2021-05-15T00:00:00\", then the corresponding value in `:ym` will be \"202105\".\n\nHere `lpad(Int(x.month), 2, '0')` is used to ensure that month has always two digits by padding with zero if it's single digit.","status":200,"tokens":[0,212],"elapsed":1.655743454,"_type":"aimessage"}]
