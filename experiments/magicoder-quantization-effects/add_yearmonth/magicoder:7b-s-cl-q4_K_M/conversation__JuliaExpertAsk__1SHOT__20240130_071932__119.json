This script assumes that your DataFrame `df` is stored in memory, as well as the DateTimes are in a column named `dt`. \n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(x -> format(x,\"YyyyMM\"), df[:dt])\n    return df\nend\n```\nThis function works by mapping over the column `dt` in your DataFrame and applying the `format` function from the Dates module. The \"YyyyMM\" string is used to format the DateTime into a string that only includes the year and month (in the form yyyymm). It then stores this new column in the DataFrame as `:ym`. \n\nHere's how you could use it:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=DateTime[]) # initialize an empty dataframe with a DateTime column\n# add some data to df...\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,227],"elapsed":1.810694945,"_type":"aimessage"}]
