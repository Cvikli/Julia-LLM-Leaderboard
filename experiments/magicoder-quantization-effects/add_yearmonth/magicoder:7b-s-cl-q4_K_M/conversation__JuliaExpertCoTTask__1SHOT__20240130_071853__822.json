This result is assigned as a new column `:ym`.\n\nNow let's try it with your sample DataFrame:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will result in the new DataFrame `df` with a column `:ym` containing the desired year-month integers.","status":200,"tokens":[0,246],"elapsed":1.98333451,"_type":"aimessage"}]
