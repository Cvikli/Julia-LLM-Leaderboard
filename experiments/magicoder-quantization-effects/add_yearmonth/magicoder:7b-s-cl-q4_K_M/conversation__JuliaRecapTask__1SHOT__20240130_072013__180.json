[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

You can do this by adding it to your project with `] add DataFrames`.\n\nThen you will be able to use DataFrame in Julia as shown below:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(x -> year(x)*100 + month(x), df.dt)\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nIn this function `add_yearmonth`, we are adding a new column `ym` to the DataFrame, and we are using the built-in Julia `map()` function that applies a given function to all elements in an array and returns the result as a new array.\n\nWe define our own anonymous function `(x -> year(x)*100 + month(x))` inside `map()`, which extracts the year and month from each DateTime in the column `dt` of DataFrame and concatenates them into the format \"yyyymm\". \n\nThe result is a new DataFrame with an additional column `ym`, where each entry corresponds to the yearmonth of the original date.","status":200,"tokens":[0,277],"elapsed":2.26505845,"_type":"aimessage"}]
