[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

You first need to install the package by running `using Pkg; Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\")`.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(x->YearMonth(x), df[:dt]) |> map(y -> string(y.year, lpad(y.month, 2, '0')))\nend\n```\nYou can then call this function with your DataFrame:\n```julia\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis function uses the `map` function to apply a transformation on each element in a column (here the `:dt` column). Each `YearMonth` object is converted back into a string. The resulting strings are then padded with zeros to ensure that they have always two digits for both year and month.\n\nIn case you want to add a new column using special instructions, such as adding one year to all dates in the DataFrame:\n\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(x->YearMonth(x)+Year(1), df[:dt]) |> map(y -> string(y.year, lpad(y.month, 2, '0')))\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,305],"elapsed":2.527461562,"_type":"aimessage"}]
