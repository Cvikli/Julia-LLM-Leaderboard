[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

The `split` function is then used to split these strings at whitespace to get individual components of the datetime string, and finally `|> first` is used to extract the first element from this list. The function compares the start times for each pair of events. If the event with a later start time has its end time after or equal to the start time of the earlier event, then there's an overlap. If such an overlap exists, it returns \"Conflict\". Else, if none of the events overlap in time, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,350],"elapsed":3.962481681,"_type":"aimessage"}]
