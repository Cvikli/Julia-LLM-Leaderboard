Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Then we iterate over each event, checking if its start time is before or equal to the previous event's end time (which means that it overlaps). If an overlap is found, we return \"Conflict\". If no conflict was found after iterating over all events, we return \"No conflicts\". In case the list of events is empty, we return \"No events\".\n\nThis function considers two events as conflicting if they start at the same time or if one event starts before another and ends after it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,286],"elapsed":3.253010357,"_type":"aimessage"}]
