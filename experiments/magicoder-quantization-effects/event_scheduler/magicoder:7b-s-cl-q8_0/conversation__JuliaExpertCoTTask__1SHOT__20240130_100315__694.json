Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia solution that uses the `Dates` and `DataStructures` packages to parse date strings and handle events as `DateTime` objects. It also uses a `BinarySearchTree` (BST) for efficient querying of overlapping events, which can be slow for larger lists due to its log(n) search time complexity.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\nusing DataStructures\ninclude(\"bst.jl\") # includes our Binary Search Tree implementation\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Array{Tuple{String, String},1})\n    if isempty(events) return \"No events\" end\n    \n    bst = BST() \n    for e in events\n        start_time = DateTime(e[1], DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"))\n        finish_time = DateTime(e[2], DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"))\n        \n        if !bst.insert(start_time, finish_time) return \"Conflict\" end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nPlease note that this is a very basic version of the event scheduler function. The actual solution might depend on the specific requirements of your task and might need additional functionality like handling overlapping events partially or dealing with events of varying durations, etc. Also, you should replace `\"bst.jl\"` with the path to your Binary Search Tree implementation file.\n\nIn this version, we create a new `BST` for each set of events, which can be very inefficient if there are many events as BSTs have a time complexity of log(n) for insertion and lookup operations. It is also worth noting that the above implementation assumes that your dates are sorted chronologically within each tuple. If they aren't, you need to sort them before processing.","status":200,"tokens":[0,406],"elapsed":4.67947142,"_type":"aimessage"}]
