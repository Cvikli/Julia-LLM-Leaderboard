If it's not, it sorts the array by start time and then iterates over each subsequent pair of events. For each event, it checks if its start time is earlier than or equal to the end time of the previous event. If so, there's a conflict and the function returns \"Conflict\".\n\nIf no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of events, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,294],"elapsed":2.638052081,"_type":"aimessage"}]
