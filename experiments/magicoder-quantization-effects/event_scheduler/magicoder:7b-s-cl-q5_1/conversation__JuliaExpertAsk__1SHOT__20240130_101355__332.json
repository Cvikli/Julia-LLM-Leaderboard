It first checks if the events array is empty, if it is it returns \"No Events\". If not it sorts the events by their starting times. Then for every event, it compares its start time to the previous event's end time (to ensure there's no overlap). \n\nIf at any point an event starts before the previous one finishes or finishes after the previous one starts, it returns \"Conflict\". If none of the events conflict with each other, it will return \"No Conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,352],"elapsed":3.174574255,"_type":"aimessage"}]
