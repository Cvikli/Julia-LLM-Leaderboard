Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia code that solves the problem using Dates package.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    dt_events = map(e -> (DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\") => e), events)\n    sorted_events = sort!(dt_events, by=first)\n\n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        prev_event = sorted_events[i-1][2]\n        curr_event = sorted_events[i][2]\n        if prev_event > curr_event\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nFirst, we parse the strings into Date type, then sort them by their start times. Then we iterate over all pairs of events and check if the end time of the first event is greater than the start time of the next event, meaning they overlap. If there's any pair that doesn't satisfy this condition, we return \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs, it means there are no overlapping events so we return \"No conflicts\". \n\nFinally, we use the function on provided example:\n```julia\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\nand it should return \"Conflict\".","status":200,"tokens":[343,397],"elapsed":5.421685493,"_type":"aimessage"}]
