You need to use the 'Dates' package for parsing dates and times, as well as for comparison.\n\nFirst of all, make sure you have the Dates package installed by running `Pkg.add(\"Dates\")` if it isn't already.\n\nHere is the code:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    # check for empty list \n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    for i in 1:(length(events)-1)\n        for j in (i+1):length(events)\n            start_event_1 = DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")(events[j][1])\n            finish_event_1 = DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")(events[j][2])\n            \n            start_event_2 = DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")(events[i][1])\n            finish_event_2 = DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")(events[i][2])\n            \n            # if events overlap, there's a conflict \n            if (start_event_2 < finish_event_1) && (start_event_1 <= finish_event_2)\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function goes through all the events, comparing each one with every other one. If two events overlap in time, it returns \"Conflict\". If no overlapping events are found after checking all pairs of events, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,393],"elapsed":3.589955544,"_type":"aimessage"}]
