Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a solution using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport itertools as it\n\ndef event_scheduler(events):\n    if not events:\n        return 'No events.'\n    \n    sorted_events = sorted([(datetime.strptime(event[0], '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'), \n                              datetime.strptime(event[1], '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')) for event in events])\n\n    pairs = list(it.combinations(sorted_events, 2))\n    \n    for pair in pairs:\n        if pair[0].time() <= pair[1].time(): # if any two event times are overlapping, return conflict\n            return 'Conflict'\n    \n    return 'No conflicts.'\n```\nThis function works by first sorting the events based on their start and end times. Then it iterates over all pairs of consecutive elements in this sorted list. If it finds an element with a start time less than or equal to the end time of another element, that means they overlap and hence returns 'Conflict'. If no pair has such situation, it returns 'No conflicts'\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that events cannot finish at exactly the same time they started. This is because otherwise, it would not know which event came second in case of overlapping.\n\nAlso, there might be a confusion when two events overlap but one ends before the other starts (i.e., one event's finish time equals to another event's start time). So this function considers such cases as no conflict too.","status":200,"tokens":[0,354],"elapsed":2.770636897,"_type":"aimessage"}]
