Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Python solution using the `datetime` module to parse dates:\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime as dt\nfrom dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta as rd\n\ndef event_scheduler(events):\n    # If there are no events, return \"No events\"\n    if not events: \n        return 'No events'\n\n    sorted_events = sorted([dt.strptime(e[0], '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M') for e in events] + [dt.strptime(e[1], '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M') for e in events])\n    start, end = zip(*sorted_events)\n    \n    for i in range(len(start)):\n        if any((end[i] > start[j] and end[i] < dt.strptime(events[j][1], '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')) \n               or (end[j] > start[i] and end[j] < dt.strptime(events[i][1], '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')) for j in range(len(start)) if i != j):\n            return 'Conflict'\n    return 'No conflicts'\n```\nThe function works by first sorting the start and end times of all events, then comparing each event to every other event. If an overlap is found, it returns \"Conflict\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,322],"elapsed":2.514537003,"_type":"aimessage"}]
