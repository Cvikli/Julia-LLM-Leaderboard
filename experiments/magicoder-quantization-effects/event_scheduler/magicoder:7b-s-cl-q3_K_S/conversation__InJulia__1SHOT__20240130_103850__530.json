If it's not, it sorts the events by their starting time. Then, for each event, it checks if its start time is before the end time of previous event(s). If any such overlap exists, the function immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no conflict is found after going through all events, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,218],"elapsed":1.686586402,"_type":"aimessage"}]
