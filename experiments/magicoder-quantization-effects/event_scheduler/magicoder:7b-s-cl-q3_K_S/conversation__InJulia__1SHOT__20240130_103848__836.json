[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

If it is, we return \"No events\".\n- We then sort the event tuples by their start times. This allows us to compare each event with its predecessor during iteration.\n- For every pair of consecutive events (i.e., for `events[i]` and `events[i+1]`) in the sorted list, we check whether the start time of the second event is before (or on) the end time of the first event. If this condition holds true, it means that there's a conflict between these two events, so we return \"Conflict\".\n- We continue checking until we find an event with no conflicts or reach the end of the list. If we have checked all events and haven't found any conflicts, we return \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,377],"elapsed":2.932628354,"_type":"aimessage"}]
