Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Here is how you would write a function to check for conflicts.\n\nFirst, install the python datetime package if not installed by using below command in your terminal.\n```bash\npip install datetime\n```\n\nThe following script checks each event against all subsequent events for any overlapping time.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime as dt\nfrom dateutil import rrule  # This is a Python date library that makes working with recurring events easier.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef event_scheduler(events):\n    if not events: return \"No events\"\n    \n    for i in range(len(events)):\n        start_i, finish_i = dt.strptime(events[i][0], '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'), dt.strptime(events[i][1], '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')  # Convert the strings to datetime objects\n        \n        for j in range(i+1, len(events)):\n            start_j, finish_j = dt.strptime(events[j][0], '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'), dt.strptime(events[j][1], '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')  # Convert the strings to datetime objects\n            \n            if start_i < finish_j and start_j < finish_i:   # If one event starts before the other ends, there is a conflict.\n                return \"Conflict\"\n                    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\n```\n\nThe function loops through each event, then checks all subsequent events to see if any overlap in time exists. It does this by comparing the start and finish times of each event pair. If there are overlapping events, it returns \"Conflict\". If no overlaps found, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,416],"elapsed":3.36837381,"_type":"aimessage"}]
