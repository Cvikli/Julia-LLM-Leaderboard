It sorts the events by start time and then checks for any overlapping events. If there is a conflict, it returns 'Conflict'. If there are no conflicts, it returns 'No conflicts'. If the list is empty, it returns 'No events'.","status":200,"tokens":[0,220],"elapsed":1.706871914,"_type":"aimessage"}]
