[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

If it finds an overlap, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If it doesn't find any overlap after checking all possible pairs of events, it returns \"No conflicts\". Note that if the list is empty, it will return \"No events\" directly as specified in the problem statement.\n\nThis function uses Dates package to parse date-time strings into DateTime objects for comparison. The `intersect` function from Dates module checks for overlapping periods. If there's an overlap, it returns a nonempty intersection; if not, it returns nothing (represented as `nothing` in Julia). Therefore, the `!isnothing(intersect((start_i, finish_i), (start_j, finish_j)))` checks for overlapping periods.","status":200,"tokens":[0,374],"elapsed":2.929568331,"_type":"aimessage"}]
