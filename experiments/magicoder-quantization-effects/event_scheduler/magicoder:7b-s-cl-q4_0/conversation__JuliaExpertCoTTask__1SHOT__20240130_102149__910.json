After that, it is just a matter of comparing each event's start and end times with all other events. Here's how you could write this function using Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String,String}})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    for (start1, finish1) in events\n        for (start2, finish2) in events\n            # check if start1 and finish2 overlap\n            s = DateTime(parse(Date, start1))\n            f = DateTime(parse(Time, finish1))\n            \n            s2 = DateTime(parse(Date, start2))\n            f2 = DateTime(parse(Time, finish2))\n            \n            if (s ≤ f2 && s2 ≤ f) || (s2 ≤ f && s ≤ f2)\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThe time comparison is done by checking if the start of any event overlaps with the finish of another or vice versa. If there's an overlap, the function returns \"Conflict\". If no events conflict, it will return \"No conflicts\". \n\nHere is how you can call the function:\n```julia\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,402],"elapsed":3.119642306,"_type":"aimessage"}]
