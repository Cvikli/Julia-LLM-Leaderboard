Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

This solution uses the Dates package to parse and manipulate date/time data.

It then loops through each pair of events, comparing their start and finish times. If any overlap is found, it returns \"Conflict\". If there are no overlapping events, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[343,348],"elapsed":4.17409776,"_type":"aimessage"}]
