The function `event_scheduler` checks if there are any conflicting times between events by comparing the start and end times of each event. If an overlap is found, it returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found in the entire list of events, it returns \"No conflicts\". If the list is empty, it will return \"No events\" as requested.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates: DateFormat, parse, Day\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    for i in 1:length(events)\n        for j in (i+1):length(events)\n            starti = parse(DateFormat.DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"), events[i][1])\n            startj = parse(DateFormat.DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"), events[j][1])\n            endi = parse(DateFormat.DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"), events[i][2])\n            endj = parse(DateFormat.DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"), events[j][2])\n            \n            if ((starti <= startj < endi) || (startj <= starti < endj))\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            elseif (starti > endj)\n                break\n            elseif (endi < starti)\n                return \"No conflicts\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function works by comparing the start and end times of each event in turn. If any pair of events overlap in time, it returns \"Conflict\". If all pairs don't overlap, but some are completely before others, it returns \"No conflicts\". If there are no events at all, it also returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,429],"elapsed":3.445726249,"_type":"aimessage"}]
