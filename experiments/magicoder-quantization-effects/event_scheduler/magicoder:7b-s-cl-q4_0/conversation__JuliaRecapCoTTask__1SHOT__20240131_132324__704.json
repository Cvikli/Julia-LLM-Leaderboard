X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

If it is, it immediately returns \"No events\". \n\nIf there are events, it sorts them by their start times. Then, it iterates over each event in the sorted list starting from the second one (since we already know that the first one doesn't conflict with anything). For each subsequent event, it checks if its start time is less than or equal to the finish time of the previous event. If this condition holds true, there's a conflict and it immediately returns \"Conflict\". \n\nIf no conflicts are found after checking all events (i.e., the loop completes without returning \"Conflict\"), it means that there were no overlapping events and it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,363],"elapsed":2.833942322,"_type":"aimessage"}]
