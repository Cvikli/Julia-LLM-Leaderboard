Then, you can loop through each event and compare it with all other events to check for any overlapping times. Here is an example solution that accomplishes this:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events) \n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    for i in 1:length(events)\n        start, finish = DateTime(events[i][1]), DateTime(events[i][2])\n        for j in (i+1):length(events)\n            s, f = DateTime(events[j][1]), DateTime(events[j][2])\n            \n            # Check if the current event overlaps with any other events \n            if !isnothing(intersect((s), start:finish)) || !isnothing(intersect((f), start:finish))\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThe function works by iterating over all events and checking each event's time against the times of all other events. If there is any overlap, it returns 'Conflict'. If no conflicts are found after checking all events, it returns 'No conflicts'.","status":200,"tokens":[0,299],"elapsed":2.305275893,"_type":"aimessage"}]
