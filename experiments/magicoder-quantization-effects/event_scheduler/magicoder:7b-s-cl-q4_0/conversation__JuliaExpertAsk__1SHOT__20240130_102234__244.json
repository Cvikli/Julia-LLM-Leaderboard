Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is an implementation of the `event_scheduler` function in Julia language. It uses the DateTime type from the Dates module to handle date and time values:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    sorted_events = sort([DateTime(event[1],\"yy-mm-dd HH:MM\") for event in events])\n    \n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if DateTime(events[i][1], \"yy-mm-dd HH:MM\") > sorted_events[i - 1]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThe function `event_scheduler` first checks if the list is empty. If it's not, it then sorts all start times of events in ascending order (using the `sort()` function and a comprehension). After that, it goes through all consecutive pairs of sorted event start times and checks whether one starts after the other ends. If such pair exists, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found, it finally returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,275],"elapsed":2.090826976,"_type":"aimessage"}]
