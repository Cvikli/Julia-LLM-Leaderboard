If it finds an overlap, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If it doesn't find any overlaps after checking all pairs of events, it returns \"No conflicts\". This is done in a way that minimizes unnecessary comparisons by only checking future events (i+1 onwards).","status":200,"tokens":[0,360],"elapsed":2.716491979,"_type":"aimessage"}]
