Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution using Julia:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort([DateTime(e[1]) : DateTime(e[2]) for e in events], by=first)\n    \n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if DateTime(sorted_events[i][1]) < DateTime(sorted_events[i-1][2])\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function first checks whether the input list is empty. If it's not, it then sorts all the events by their start times and converts them to DateTime objects for easier comparison. \n\nThen, it iterates over all the sorted events (excluding the first one), checking if any event's start time is before the previous event's end time. If there's such an overlap, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of consecutive events, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,257],"elapsed":1.940994655,"_type":"aimessage"}]
