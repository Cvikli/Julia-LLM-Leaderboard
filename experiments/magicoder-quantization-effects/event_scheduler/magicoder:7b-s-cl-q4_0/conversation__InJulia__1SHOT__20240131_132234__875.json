[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If it finds a conflict (i.e., an overlap), it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all possible pairs of events, it finally returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the input format is as described: a list of tuples where each tuple contains two strings representing the start and finish times. It uses `Dates.DateTime` to parse these strings into date-time objects for comparison.","status":200,"tokens":[0,302],"elapsed":2.278872816,"_type":"aimessage"}]
