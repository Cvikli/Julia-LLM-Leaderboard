Here's a Julia function that does this:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates  # This is the package you need to use for time parsing in Julia\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    for i=1:length(events)-1\n        for j=(i+1):length(events)\n            start_time1 = DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")(events[i][1])  # Parse the start time of event i\n            finish_time1 = DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")(events[i][2])  # Parse the finish time of event i\n            \n            start_time2 = DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")(events[j][1])  # Parse the start time of event j\n            finish_time2 = DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")(events[j][2])  # Parse the finish time of event j\n            \n            if (start_time1 < finish_time2) && (start_time2 < finish_time1)  \n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"  # If there's no conflict, return this string\nend\n```\nYou can call the function with a list of events like so:\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2022-12-31 23:59\", \"2023-01-01 00:01\"), (\"2022-12-30 00:01\", \"2022-12-30 00:02\")]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events)) # Will output \"Conflict\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,445],"elapsed":3.413708146,"_type":"aimessage"}]
