[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

It assumes that the time intervals for each event do not overlap with the next event's interval, thus it only needs to check if the start of current event is less than finish of previous event and vice versa. If such conditions are met, then there is a conflict between these two events.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes the events are given in correct order (i.e., earlier events don't overlap with later ones). You might need to sort the events before applying this function if they are not already sorted.","status":200,"tokens":[0,353],"elapsed":2.697797923,"_type":"aimessage"}]
