If it is, it returns \"No events\". If not, it sorts the events by start time. Then it goes through each event, checking for any overlap with previous events (by comparing their finish times). If an overlap is found, the function immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after going through all events, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,286],"elapsed":2.788469091,"_type":"aimessage"}]
