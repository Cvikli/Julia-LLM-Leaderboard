Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Otherwise, it converts the start and finish times to DateTime format using Dates package's `DateTime` constructor and `parse` function which takes a string and a DateFormat object as arguments. Then it iterates over all pairs of events (except for the first one), comparing each event's start time with the previous event's finish time, and vice versa. If any overlap is found, it returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\" if no overlapping events are detected.","status":200,"tokens":[0,334],"elapsed":3.258780789,"_type":"aimessage"}]
