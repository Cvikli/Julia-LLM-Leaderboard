If it finds an overlap, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs, it finally returns \"No conflicts\". \n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the input list of events is sorted by start time. If this assumption does not hold, you would need to sort the events first before calling `event_scheduler`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,308],"elapsed":2.935981241,"_type":"aimessage"}]
