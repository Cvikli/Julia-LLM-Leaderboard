Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If it is, it returns \"No events\". It then sorts the list of events by their start times. After that, it iterates over each event and compares its start time to the end time of the previous event. If a conflict exists (i.e., an event starts before the previous one ends), it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all events, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[343,275],"elapsed":20.662433545,"_type":"aimessage"}]
