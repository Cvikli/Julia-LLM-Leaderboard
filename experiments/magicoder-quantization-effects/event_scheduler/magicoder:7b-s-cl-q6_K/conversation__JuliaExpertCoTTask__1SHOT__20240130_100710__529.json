Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can solve this problem in Julia using Dates package:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    for i=1:length(events)\n       for j=(i+1):length(events)\n           starti = DateTime(string(events[i][1])*\" UTC\")\n           finishi = DateTime(string(events[i][2])*\" UTC\")\n           \n           startj = DateTime(string(events[j][1])*\" UTC\")\n           finishj = DateTime(string(events[j][2])*\" UTC\")\n           \n           if (startj < finishi) && (finishj > starti) \n               return \"Conflict\"\n           end\n       end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the events list is empty and returns \"No events\" if true. Then it goes through each pair of events in the list to see if they overlap. It does this by comparing the start time of one event with the finish time of the other, and vice versa. If an overlap exists, the function immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no overlaps are found after checking all pairs of events, it finally returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,299],"elapsed":2.951020044,"_type":"aimessage"}]
