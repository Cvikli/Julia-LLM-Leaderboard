Then, for each pair of consecutive events (i-1) and (i), it calculates the start and finish time of these two events. If any start time or end time of the two events overlap, it means there's a scheduling conflict, so it will return 'Conflict'. Otherwise, if no overlaps are found for all pairs, it returns 'No conflicts'. \n\nThe function uses `Dates.DateTime` to parse the strings into date and time, and then compares these parsed values to determine any overlapping events.","status":200,"tokens":[0,437],"elapsed":4.367830941,"_type":"aimessage"}]
