Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia solution that uses the `Dates` package to parse the date/time strings into `DateTime` objects:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    times = sort([DateTime(event[1])=>DateTime(event[2]) for event in events], by=x->x.first)\n    \n    for i in 2:length(times)\n        if times[i].first <= times[i-1].second\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list of events is empty. If it's not, it sorts the list based on the start time of each event. Then it iterates over the sorted list and checks for any overlap in start or end times. The `sort` function with a custom comparison function is used to sort the DateTime objects based on their values (i.e., the start time of the events).\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the input list of events is non-empty, and it's sorted in ascending order by start time. If these assumptions are not met, you may need to add additional error checking code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,290],"elapsed":2.797018189,"_type":"aimessage"}]
