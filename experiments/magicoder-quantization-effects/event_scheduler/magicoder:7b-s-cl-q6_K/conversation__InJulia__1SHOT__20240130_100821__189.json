[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If it is, we return \"No events\". \n\nIf the list is not empty, we sort the event list by the start time of each event in ascending order. This way, we're certain that any conflicts will be located at the front of our sorted list. We then iterate through this list and check for overlapping events. If an event starts before the previous event ends, there is a conflict, so we return \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all the events, we return \"No conflicts\". \n\nPlease note that the `split(sorted_events[i][2], ' ')[2]` part of code is used to separate date and time in the event string. It assumes the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'. You may need to adjust this based on your actual input format if it's different.","status":200,"tokens":[0,415],"elapsed":4.060127119,"_type":"aimessage"}]
