Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia solution using the `Dates` package:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Array{Tuple{String, String}, 1})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    sorted_events = sort(events, by=x -> DateTime(string(first(x), \" \", last(x))))\n    \n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        prev_event = DateTime(string(first(sorted_events[i-1]), \" \", last(sorted_events[i-1])))\n        curr_event = DateTime(string(first(sorted_events[i]), \" \", last(sorted_events[i])))\n        \n        if curr_event > prev_event\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list of events is empty. If it is, it returns \"No events\". Otherwise, it sorts the events by their start times. Then, for each event in the sorted list (except the first one), it compares its start time with the end time of the previous event. If the current event's start time is after the previous event's end time, that means there is a conflict and the function returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,318],"elapsed":3.045874983,"_type":"aimessage"}]
