If it is, it returns \"No events\". It then sorts the events by their start times. After that, it iterates through the sorted list starting from the second event (since we already know the first one doesn't conflict with anything). For each event, it checks whether its start time is earlier than or equal to the finish time of the previous event. If it is, then there is a conflict and the function returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all events, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,300],"elapsed":2.909234551,"_type":"aimessage"}]
