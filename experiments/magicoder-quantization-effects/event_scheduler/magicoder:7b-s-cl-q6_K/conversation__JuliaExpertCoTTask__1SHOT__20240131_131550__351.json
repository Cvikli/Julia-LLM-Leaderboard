Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

The approach is to sort the list of events by their start times and then check for conflicts by comparing each event's finish time with the next event's start time.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Array{Tuple{String, String}, 1})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort!(events, by=x -> DateTime(x[1]))\n\n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if DateTime(sorted_events[i][1]) < DateTime(sorted_events[i-1][2])\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nYou can test the function using:\n\n```julia\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\nThis will return `\"Conflict\"`, because the second event starts at \"2023-12-01 11:30\" which is before the first event's finish time of \"2023-12-01 11:00\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,347],"elapsed":3.381781132,"_type":"aimessage"}]
