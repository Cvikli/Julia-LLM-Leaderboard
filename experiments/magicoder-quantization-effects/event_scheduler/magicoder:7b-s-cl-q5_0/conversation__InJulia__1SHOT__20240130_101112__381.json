If not, it returns \"No events\". Then it sorts the list of events in ascending order by their start time. It then iterates through each pair of consecutive events and checks for overlapping times. If there is a conflict, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, after checking all pairs without finding any conflict, it finally returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,361],"elapsed":3.125089429,"_type":"aimessage"}]
