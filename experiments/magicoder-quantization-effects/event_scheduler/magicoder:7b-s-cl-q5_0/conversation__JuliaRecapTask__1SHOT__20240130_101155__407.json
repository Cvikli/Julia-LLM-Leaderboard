[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

If it's not, it sorts the array based on event start times and then iterates over the sorted array to check for any conflicts. If a conflict is found (if an event starts before the previous event ends), the function immediately returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, if no conflicts are found after checking all events, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nYou can call this function with your list of tuples representing event start and end times as follows:\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2022-01-01 08:30\", \"2022-01-01 10:00\"), (\"2022-01-01 12:00\", \"2022-01-01 14:00\"), (\"2022-01-01 09:00\", \"2022-01-01 11:00\")]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events)) # Outputs \"Conflict\" as there is an overlap in the second event.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,451],"elapsed":3.998258027,"_type":"aimessage"}]
