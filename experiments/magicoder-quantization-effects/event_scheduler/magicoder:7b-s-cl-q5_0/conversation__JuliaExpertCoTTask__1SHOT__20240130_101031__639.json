Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

We first import the necessary packages, including Dates. Then we define our function event_scheduler to parse the input strings into DateTime objects, and compare each start time with all finish times of previous events. If there's any conflict, return \"Conflict\". Else if there are no events or no conflicts return \"No conflicts\" or \"No events\" respectively.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    for i in 1:length(events)\n        start_time = DateTime(events[i][1])\n        finish_time = DateTime(events[i][2])\n        if any(start_time <= DateTime(e[2]) < finish_time for e in events[1:i-1])\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    length(events) > 0 ? \"No conflicts\" : \"No events\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function iterates through each event, checking whether it overlaps with any previous event by comparing the start time of the current event to all finish times from the first to the (i-1)th event.
