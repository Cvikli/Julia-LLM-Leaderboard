Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Then it converts the start and finish times of each event to DateTime objects. It then iterates over each event checking for any overlap with later events by comparing the start time of an event with all following event's finish times. If a conflict is found, it returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of events, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,319],"elapsed":2.792709297,"_type":"aimessage"}]
