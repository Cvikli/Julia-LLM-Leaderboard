Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime as dt\nimport itertools\nfrom dateutil import parser  # for parsing string to datetime object\n\ndef event_scheduler(events):\n    if len(events) == 0:\n        return \"No events\"\n    \n    events = [parser.parse(x[0]) <= parser.parse(x[1]) for x in events]\n    # check for conflicts\n    if any(itertools.combinations(events, 2)):\n        return 'Conflict'\n    else:\n        return 'No conflicts'\n```\n\nThis function checks if the start time of each event is less than or equal to its finish time and returns an appropriate message based on whether there are overlaps among the events.
