[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

It uses the `intersect` function from the Dates package to find the intersection of two ranges (the start and finish times of each event). If there is an overlap, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of events, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the events are not nested. If they can be nested, you would need a more complex algorithm to check for overlapping events.","status":200,"tokens":[0,325],"elapsed":2.722099617,"_type":"aimessage"}]
