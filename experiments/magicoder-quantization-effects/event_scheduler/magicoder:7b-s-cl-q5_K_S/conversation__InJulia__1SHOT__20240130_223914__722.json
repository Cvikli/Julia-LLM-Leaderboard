Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

If an overlap is found, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no overlap is found after checking all pairs of events, it finally returns \"No conflicts\". \n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes that the events are sorted by their start time and that they do not have overlapping finish times (i.e., if an event ends at a certain time, all subsequent events must start after that time). If these assumptions do not hold, the function may return incorrect results.","status":200,"tokens":[0,391],"elapsed":3.284322183,"_type":"aimessage"}]
