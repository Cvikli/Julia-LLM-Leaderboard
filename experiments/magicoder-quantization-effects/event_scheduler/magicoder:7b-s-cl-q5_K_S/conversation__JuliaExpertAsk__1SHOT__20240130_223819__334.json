Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution using Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Array{Tuple{String, String}, 1})\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort!(events, by=x -> DateTime(first(x), \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"))\n    \n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if DateTime(last(sorted_events[i - 1]), \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\") > DateTime(first(sorted_events[i]), \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list of events is empty. If it's not, it sorts the array by the start time of each event. Then it iterates over the sorted array starting from the second element (because we already know that the first event doesn't conflict with anything). For each subsequent event, it checks whether its end time is after the start time of the previous event. If it is, then there's a conflict and the function returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all events, the function returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the input list of events is sorted in ascending order by their start times. If this assumption doesn't hold, you need to sort the array before calling `event_scheduler`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,349],"elapsed":2.942581492,"_type":"aimessage"}]
