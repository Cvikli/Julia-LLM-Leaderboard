If it is, it returns \"No events\". Then it sorts the array of events by their start times. \n\nAfter sorting, it goes through each event and compares its start time to the previous event's end time (to check for overlap). If there is any overlap, it immediately returns \"Conflict\", as there are scheduling conflicts among the events.\n\nIf no conflict is found after checking all the events, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,290],"elapsed":2.455315933,"_type":"aimessage"}]
