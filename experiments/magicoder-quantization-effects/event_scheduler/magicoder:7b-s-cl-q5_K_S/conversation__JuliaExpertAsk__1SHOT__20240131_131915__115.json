Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a solution using Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort(events, by=x -> DateTime(x[1], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"))\n    \n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if DateTime(sorted_events[i][1]) < DateTime(sorted_events[i - 1][2])\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list of events is empty. If it is, it returns \"No events\". It then sorts all the events by their start times. After sorting, it iterates over each event in the sorted list and checks if its start time is before the end time of the previous event. If so, that means there's a conflict, so it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If it doesn't find any conflicts, it finally returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nYou can use this function like:\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2021-08-30 14:00\", \"2021-08-30 16:00\"), (\"2021-08-30 15:00\", \"2021-08-30 17:00\")]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events)) # outputs: Conflict\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,353],"elapsed":2.998176091,"_type":"aimessage"}]
