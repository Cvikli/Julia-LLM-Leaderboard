If it's not, it sorts the list by the start time of each event. Then, for every pair of consecutive events, it checks whether the start time of the second event is less than or equal to the finish time of the first event. If this condition holds true, that means there is a conflict between these two events and the function returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, if no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of events, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,260],"elapsed":2.211208744,"_type":"aimessage"}]
