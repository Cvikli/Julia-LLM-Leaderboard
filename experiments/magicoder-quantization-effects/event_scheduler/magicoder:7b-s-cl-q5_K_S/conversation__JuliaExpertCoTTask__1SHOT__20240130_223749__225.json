Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If it's not, it sorts the list by start time and then iterates over each event. For each event, it compares its start time with the finish time of the previous event. If a conflict exists (i.e., an event starts before the previous one has finished), it returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all events, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,255],"elapsed":2.169485812,"_type":"aimessage"}]
