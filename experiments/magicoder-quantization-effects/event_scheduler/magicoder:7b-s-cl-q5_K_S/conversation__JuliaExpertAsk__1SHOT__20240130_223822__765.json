Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia solution using the `Dates` package:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort!(events, by=first)\n\n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        start_time1, finish_time1 = map(x -> DateTime(x, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"), sorted_events[i - 1])\n        start_time2, finish_time2 = map(x -> DateTime(x, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"), sorted_events[i])\n        \n        if (start_time1 < finish_time2) && (finish_time1 > start_time2)\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function first checks whether the list of events is empty. If it's not, it sorts all the events by their starting time. Then it iterates over each pair of consecutive events and compares their start and finish times to see if they overlap. If any pair of events overlap in time, it returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,300],"elapsed":2.523010119,"_type":"aimessage"}]
