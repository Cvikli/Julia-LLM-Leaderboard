If it is, it returns \"No events\". \n\nIt then sorts the list of events by their start times. This makes it easier to check for overlapping events because we can simply compare each event's start time with the previous event's finish time. \n\nIf any event starts before the previous event has finished, that means there is a conflict and the function returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of events, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,370],"elapsed":3.102504516,"_type":"aimessage"}]
