Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of `event_scheduler` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Array)\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    for i = 1:length(events)-1\n        e1, e2 = events[i], events[i+1]\n        \n        start1, finish1 = parse(Date, getfield(e1, :start)), parse(Time, getfield(e1, :finish))\n        start2, finish2 = parse(Date, getfield(e2, :start)), parse(Time, getfield(e2, :finish))\n        \n        if (start1 <= start2 < finish1) || (start2 < finish1 <= finish2)\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list of events is empty. If it's empty, it returns \"No events\". It then goes through each event pair, parsing their start and finish times, and checking for any overlap between them. If an overlap is found, it returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it continues to check the rest of the events. If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of events, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,306],"elapsed":2.625118563,"_type":"aimessage"}]
