Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

It does this by comparing each start time of an event to every other event's finish time, or vice versa, as well as checking for exact same start times with different end times (which can form an overlap).\n\nNote: This function assumes that the input events list is sorted in chronological order, which is not checked. If the list is not sorted you might want to sort it before running the loop.","status":200,"tokens":[153,496],"elapsed":4.35055053,"_type":"aimessage"}]
