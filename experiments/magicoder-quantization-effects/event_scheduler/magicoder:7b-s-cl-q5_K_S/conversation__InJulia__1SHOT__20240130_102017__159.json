[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

It then goes through each pair of consecutive events, checking for overlapping times. If a conflict is found, the function immediately returns \"Conflict\". \n\nPlease note that this approach assumes that the events do not overlap in the beginning or at the end only but not in the middle. For more complex scheduling scenarios, more sophisticated algorithms may be needed to correctly identify all conflicts.","status":200,"tokens":[0,497],"elapsed":4.310815405,"_type":"aimessage"}]
