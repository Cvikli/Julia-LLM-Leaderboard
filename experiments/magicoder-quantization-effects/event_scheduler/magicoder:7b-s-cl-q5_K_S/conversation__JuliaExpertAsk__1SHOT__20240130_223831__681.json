Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia solution using the Dates package:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort!(events, by=x -> DateTime(x[1]))\n    \n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        start_time_current_event = DateTime(sorted_events[i][1])\n        finish_time_current_event = DateTime(sorted_events[i][2])\n        \n        start_time_previous_event = DateTime(sorted_events[i-1][1])\n        finish_time_previous_event = DateTime(sorted_events[i-1][2])\n        \n        if (start_time_current_event < finish_time_previous_event) && \n           (finish_time_current_event > start_time_previous_event)\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list of events is empty. If it is, it returns \"No events\". It then sorts the list of events by their start times. After sorting, it iterates over each event in the sorted list, comparing its start and finish times with every previous event's start and finish times. If any pair of events overlap in time, it returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,333],"elapsed":2.801747296,"_type":"aimessage"}]
