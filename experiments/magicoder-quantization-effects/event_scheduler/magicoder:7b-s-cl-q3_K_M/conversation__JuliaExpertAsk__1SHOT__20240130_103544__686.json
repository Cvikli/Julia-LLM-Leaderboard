Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is a Julia program that solves this problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Array{Tuple{String, String}, 1})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    times = [DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\") => x[1] for x in events]\n    finish_times = [DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\") => x[2] for x in events]\n    \n    for (i, time) in enumerate(times)\n        if any([time < t <= finish_times[i] for t in times])\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function firstly converts the date strings into `DateTime` objects. Then it iterates through each event to check if any other event overlaps with it. If a conflict is found, it returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it finally returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,238],"elapsed":1.837164913,"_type":"aimessage"}]
