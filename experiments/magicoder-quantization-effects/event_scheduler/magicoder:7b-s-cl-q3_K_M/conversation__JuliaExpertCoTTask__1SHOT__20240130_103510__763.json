Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

We use the `Dates` package to parse the dates and `DataStructures` package to easily handle overlapping time slots. The function checks if any of the events overlap in time by using the `isintersection()` function from the `DataStructures` package.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates, DataStructures\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Array{Tuple{String, String}, 1})\n    dates = [parse.(DateTime, [e[1], e[2]]) for e in events]\n    times = intersectall([first(dates), last(dates)])\n    \n    if isempty(times)\n        return \"No conflicts\"\n    else\n        return \"Conflict\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nYou can use this function with the provided example like so: \n\n```julia\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\nThis will return `\"Conflict\"` as the events overlap from `9:00` to `11:00` and from `11:30` to `12:30`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,323],"elapsed":2.538008464,"_type":"aimessage"}]
