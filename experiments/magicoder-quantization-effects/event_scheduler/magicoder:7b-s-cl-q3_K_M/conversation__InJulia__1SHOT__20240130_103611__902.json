[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

If it's not, it parses each event's start and finish time into `DateTime` format, then sorts this array in ascending order. It then checks each event against the next one to see whether there are any overlapping events.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that all events will have a valid date and time format, and that the events do not overlap at all.","status":200,"tokens":[0,375],"elapsed":2.905750401,"_type":"aimessage"}]
