[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

The `intersect` function from Dates module is used to find out if there's an intersection between two time intervals. If it finds a conflict, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no conflict is found after checking all the events, then it will return \"No conflicts\".\n\nRemember that this solution assumes that the input is valid and in proper format (i.e., it's a tuple with two strings representing a date). Also note that this solution has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of events. This could be improved by using a data structure that allows for more efficient lookup or sorting, but that would increase the space complexity and might not be necessary based on your use case.","status":200,"tokens":[0,529],"elapsed":4.285464346,"_type":"aimessage"}]
