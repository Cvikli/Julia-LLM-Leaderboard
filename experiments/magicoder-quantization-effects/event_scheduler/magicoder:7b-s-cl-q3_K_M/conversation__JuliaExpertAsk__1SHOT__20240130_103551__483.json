For each pair, it checks if the previous event's finish time is later than or equal to the next event's start time, which would indicate an overlap. If any such pair is found, the function returns \"Conflict\". If no overlapping events are found after checking all pairs, it returns \"No conflicts\". \n\nPlease note that the date parsing format used here assumes your time strings are in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM' format.","status":200,"tokens":[0,376],"elapsed":2.934921481,"_type":"aimessage"}]
