After that, you just need to compare each pair of events and check if there is any overlap between them. Here is a code snippet for this problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Array)\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted = sort(collect(events), by=x -> x[1]) # Sort events based on start time\n\n    for i in 1:length(sorted)-1\n        s1, f1 = split.(sorted[i], ' ')\n        s2, f2 = split.(sorted[i+1], ' ')\n        \n        dt1 = DateTime(s1) # Convert string to DateTime\n        dt2 = DateTime(s2)\n\n        if dt1 > dt2 \n            return \"Conflict\"\n        elseif dt2 > dt1 && dt2 < f1 || f1 > dt2\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nIn this function, we first check if the list is empty. If it is, we return \"No events\". We then sort the array of tuples based on their start times and iterate over them in pairs. For each pair, we split the tuple strings into date and time parts and convert them to DateTime objects. After that, we compare the two event's end time and finish time. If there is any overlap between these two events, we return \"Conflict\". Otherwise, we return \"No conflicts\" indicating no schedule conflict.","status":200,"tokens":[343,371],"elapsed":4.209358367,"_type":"aimessage"}]
