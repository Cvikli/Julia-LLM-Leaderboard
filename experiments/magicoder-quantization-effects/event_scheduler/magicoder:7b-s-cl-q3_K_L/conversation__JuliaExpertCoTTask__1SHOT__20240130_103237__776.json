Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

This function `event_scheduler` accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two dates that represent the start and end times respectively. It first checks if the events list is empty. If it is, it returns \"No events\". Then, it goes through each event in the list using a loop. For each event, it uses the `DateFormat` function from the Dates package to parse the date strings into Date objects. It then compares these dates with the start and end times of all previous events to check for any overlapping events. If there are any overlapping events, the function returns \"Conflict\".\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    else\n        for i in 1:length(events)\n            start = DateFormat(\"yyyymmdd HH:MM\")(events[i][1])\n            finish = DateFormat(\"yyyymmdd HH:MM\")(events[i][2])\n            \n            if i > 1 && (start <= DateFormat(\"yyyymmdd HH:MM\")(events[i-1][2]) || start <= finish)\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n        \n        return \"No conflicts\"\n    end\nend\n```\nYou can use the function `event_scheduler` with your sample data like this:\n\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events)) # Returns: Conflict\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,427],"elapsed":3.510240869,"_type":"aimessage"}]
