Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

This function uses the Dates package to parse and compare dates in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    sorted_events = sort!(events, by=t -> DateTime.(first.(t), format\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")) # Sort events based on start time\n\n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events) # Compare each event with the one before it\n        curr_event = sorted_events[i]\n        prev_event = sorted_events[i - 1]\n        \n        if DateTime.(curr_event[1], format\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\") <= DateTime(prev_event[2], format\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\") # If the current event starts before the previous one ends, there's an overlap\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\" \nend\n```\nThe function `event_scheduler` first checks if there are any events. If not, it returns \"No events\". It then sorts the list of events based on their start times. After sorting, for each event, it compares its start time with the end time of the previous event in the sorted list. If the current event's start time is before the end time of the previous event, there's an overlap and the function returns \"Conflict\". If no events overlap, the function returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nFor example:\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events)) # Outputs: No conflicts\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,472],"elapsed":3.886672956,"_type":"aimessage"}]
