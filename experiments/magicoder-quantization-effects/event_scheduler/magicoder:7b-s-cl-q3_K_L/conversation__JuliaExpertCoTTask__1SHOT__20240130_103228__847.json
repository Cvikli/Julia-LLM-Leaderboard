Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

If any two events overlap in time, return \"Conflict\".\n\nFirst, let's import `Dates` package and parse your input dates using `DateTime` type:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    for (i,(start1, finish1)) in enumerate(events)\n        start1 = DateTime(start1, \"yyyymmdd HH:MM\")\n        finish1 = DateTime(finish1, \"yyyymmdd HH:MM\")\n        \n        for (j=(i+1):length(events))\n            start2, finish2 = events[j]\n            \n            start2 = DateTime(start2, \"yyyymmdd HH:MM\")\n            finish2 = DateTime(finish2, \"yyyymmdd HH:MM\")\n            \n            if !isempty(intersect(start1..finish1, start2..finish2))\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nHere's how this function works: it iterates over the list of events and for each event it compares with all subsequent events. If it finds an overlap in time, it returns \"Conflict\". If there is no overlap for any pair of events, it will continue to check the next pairs. If there are no conflicts in any of the pairs (and no pairs at all), it will return \"No conflicts\".\n  \nYou can use this function with your provided data:\n```julia\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,453],"elapsed":3.71819258,"_type":"aimessage"}]
