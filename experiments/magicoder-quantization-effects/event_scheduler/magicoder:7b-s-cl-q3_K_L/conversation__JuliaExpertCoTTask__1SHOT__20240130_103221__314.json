This package allows for easy and efficient handling of dates, times, periods and timestamps in your code.\n\nFirstly, you should parse each date in the tuple to a Date type from Dates package. Then, you can compare if any two events overlap by comparing their start and finish times. If an overlap is found, return \"Conflict\", otherwise return \"No conflicts\".\n\nHere's how it would look:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events) \n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    for i in 1:(length(events)-1)\n        starti, fini = parse.(Date, first.(events[i])) , parse.(Date, last.(events[i]))\n        for j in (i+1):length(events)\n            startj, finishj = parse.(Date, first.(events[j])), parse.(Date, last.(events[j]))\n            if !isempty(intersect(starti:durations(fini - starti), startj:durations(finishj - startj)))\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function loops through each event and checks if any other events overlap with it. If it finds a conflict, it immediately returns the string \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all possible pairs of events, it returns \"No conflicts\". \n\nYou can call this function with your example data like this:\n```julia\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```","status":200,"tokens":[343,446],"elapsed":4.993150685,"_type":"aimessage"}]
