[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If it is, it returns a string stating that there are no events. It then parses each event's start and finish time into DateTime format. After that, it checks for any conflict by comparing the start and finish time of each event with all other events. If it finds an event whose start time is after or on the same line as another event's finish time, there must be a conflict; hence, it sets `conflict` to true and returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, if no conflicts are found, it simply returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,309],"elapsed":2.481707721,"_type":"aimessage"}]
