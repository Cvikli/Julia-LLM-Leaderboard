You can add it by running `]add Dates` in your Julia console.\n\nHere is an example of how you could implement the function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events) \n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort!(events, by = x -> (x[1], x[2])) # sort the list of tuples to ensure correct comparison of overlapping times.\n    \n    for i in 1:length(sorted_events) - 1\n        event1 = sorted_events[i]\n        event2 = sorted_events[i+1]\n        \n        if DateTime(event1[2]) > DateTime(event2[1]) # If an event finishes after the next one starts, there's a conflict.\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function works by first checking if the input list of events is empty. If it is, it returns \"No events\". \n\nThen, it sorts the list of tuples in ascending order based on both start and finish times (using `sort!` with a custom sort function). It then iterates over each pair of consecutive events and checks if they have any overlap. If there's an overlap, it returns \"Conflict\". \n\nIf no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of events, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,361],"elapsed":2.917514421,"_type":"aimessage"}]
