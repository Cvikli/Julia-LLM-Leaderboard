Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you might write the `event_scheduler` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events) \n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort!(events, by=x->Dates.datetime2period(Dates.Date(x[1])).value)\n    \n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        prev_event = sorted_events[i-1]\n        curr_event = sorted_events[i]\n        \n        if Dates.datetime2period(Dates.Date(curr_event[1])).value <= Dates.datetime2period(Dates.Date(prev_event[2]))\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\" \nend\n```\n\nHere's how this function works:\n- It first checks if the event list is empty and returns \"No events\".\n- Then, it sorts the event list by their start times.\n- It then iterates over the sorted list of events, comparing each one to the previous one. If any current event starts before the previous event ends, that means there's a conflict (the current event overlaps with the previous one). The function returns \"Conflict\" in this case.\n- If it doesn't find any conflicting events, then all events are non-overlapping and it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,334],"elapsed":2.688581751,"_type":"aimessage"}]
