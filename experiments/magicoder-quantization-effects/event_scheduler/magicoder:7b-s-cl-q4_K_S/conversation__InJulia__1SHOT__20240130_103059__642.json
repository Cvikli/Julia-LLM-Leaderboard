If there is any overlap (i.e., if an event's start time is later than a previous event's end time, but earlier than the next event's start time), it returns \"Conflict\".\n\nIf no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of events, it finally returns \"No conflicts\". \n\nRemember that in the given format ('YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'), the last event doesn't have a second 'HH:MM'. This is why we use `last(split(...))` to get just the date part.","status":200,"tokens":[0,477],"elapsed":3.697216978,"_type":"aimessage"}]
