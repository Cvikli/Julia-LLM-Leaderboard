Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a solution to your problem using Julia:\n```julia\nusing Dates\nfunction event_scheduler(events) \n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort([DateTime(event[1] * \" \" * event[2]) for event in events], rev=true)\n\n    for i in 1:length(sorted_events)-1\n        if sorted_events[i] > sorted_events[i+1]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function first checks whether the list of events is empty. If it is, it returns \"No events\". Otherwise, it sorts the array of event times in descending order (i.e., most recent to least recent) and then iterates through this sorted list. For each pair of consecutive events, it checks if the start time of the first event is later than the end time of the second event - if so, it means there's a conflict and it returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of events, it finally returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the format for start and end times (which it uses to construct DateTime objects) is consistent throughout your input data. For example, both 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM' and 'HH:MM DD-MM-YYYY' are acceptable formats as long as they're used consistently within the same function call.","status":200,"tokens":[0,341],"elapsed":2.631666836,"_type":"aimessage"}]
