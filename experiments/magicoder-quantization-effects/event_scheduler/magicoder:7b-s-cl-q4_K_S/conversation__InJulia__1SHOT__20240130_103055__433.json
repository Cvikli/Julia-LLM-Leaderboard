If it's not, we then parse each event's start and finish times using `parse` from package Dates. We then loop through every event (except for the current one), checking whether there are any overlaps in time with the current event by comparing their start and finish times. If an overlap is found, we return \"Conflict\". If no overlap is found after checking all events, we return \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,437],"elapsed":3.383194424,"_type":"aimessage"}]
