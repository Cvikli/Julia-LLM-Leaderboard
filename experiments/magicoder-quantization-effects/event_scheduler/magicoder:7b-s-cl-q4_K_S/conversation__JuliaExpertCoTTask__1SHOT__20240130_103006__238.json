Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

The sorted_events array is a list of DateTime objects that are sorted by their start time. \n\nWe iterate through each event in sorted_events after the first one (because the first event can't overlap with anything). For each event, we check if its start time comes before the end time of the last event we checked. If it does, there's an overlap and we set `overlapping_events` to true.\n\nFinally, after checking all the events, we return `\"Conflict\"` if `overlapping_events` is true, and `\"No conflicts\"` otherwise.","status":200,"tokens":[0,401],"elapsed":3.167117795,"_type":"aimessage"}]
