If it's not, for each event we calculate its start and finish time using `Dates`. We then iterate through all other events to check for any overlap. If there's an overlap, we immediately return \"Conflict\". If no conflict was found after checking all events, we return \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,768],"elapsed":6.196942491,"_type":"aimessage"}]
