If it's not, we sort the events by their start time. Then we iterate over the sorted events starting from the second one. For each pair of consecutive events, we compare their start and end times to find any overlap or conflicts.\n\nTo use this function with some example data:\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2022-01-01 08:00\", \"2022-01-01 09:30\"),\n          (\"2022-01-01 07:45\", \"2022-01-01 10:30\"),\n          (\"2022-01-01 06:00\", \"2022-01-01 08:30\")]\n          \nprintln(event_scheduler(events))  # Outputs: No conflicts\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,399],"elapsed":3.087289078,"_type":"aimessage"}]
