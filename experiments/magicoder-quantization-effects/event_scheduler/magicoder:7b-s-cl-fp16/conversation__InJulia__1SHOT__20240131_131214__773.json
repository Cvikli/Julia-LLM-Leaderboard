Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

If there is an intersection, it returns 'Conflict'. If no overlap is found after checking all pairs of events, it returns 'No conflicts'. \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the given time intervals are inclusive at both ends i.e., a time interval from '2021-06-01 10:00' to '2021-06-01 11:00' includes both start and end times. If your data format is different, you may need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[123,380],"elapsed":6.592496649,"_type":"aimessage"}]
