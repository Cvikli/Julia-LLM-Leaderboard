Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple solution using Python's built-in `datetime` module:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime as dt\nfrom operator import itemgetter\n\ndef event_scheduler(events):\n    if not events:\n        return \"No events\"\n    \n    # sort the list of tuples in ascending order by start time\n    sorted_events = sorted(events, key=itemgetter(0))\n    \n    for i in range(len(sorted_events) - 1):\n        \n        # convert the datetime strings to datetime objects\n        start1 = dt.strptime(sorted_events[i][0], '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')\n        end1 = dt.strptime(sorted_events[i][1], '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')\n        \n        # check for conflict if the current event's end time is after the next event's start time\n        if end1 > dt.strptime(sorted_events[i + 1][0], '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'):\n            return \"Conflict\"\n            \n    return \"No conflicts\"\n```\nThis function first sorts the list of events by their start times. Then, it iterates over each pair of adjacent events and checks if there's a conflict between them. If there is any conflict, it immediately returns 'Conflict'. If no conflict is found after checking all pairs, it returns 'No conflicts'. If the input list is empty, it simply returns \"No events\".\n\nPlease note that Python's datetime module uses 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM' as its default format.","status":200,"tokens":[153,370],"elapsed":6.544402897,"_type":"aimessage"}]
