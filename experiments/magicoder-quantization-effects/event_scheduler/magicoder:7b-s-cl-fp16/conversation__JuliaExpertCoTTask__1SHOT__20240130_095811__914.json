Here is a possible implementation of the `event_scheduler` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates  # To use this package, it needs to be installed\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Array{Tuple{String, String}, 1})\n    if length(events) == 0   # If the list is empty\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    for i in 2:length(events)\n        start_time = DateTime(events[i][1], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n        finish_time = DateTime(events[i][2], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n        \n        previous_start = DateTime(events[i - 1][1], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n        previous_finish = DateTime(events[i - 1][2], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n\n        if (previous_start < start_time) && (previous_finish > finish_time) # If current event overlaps with previous one\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"  # No conflict found, all events are non-overlapping\nend\n```\nYou can test this function using the given example:\n\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events))   # Outputs: No conflicts\n```\nIn the example, we have two events with no overlapping times. Therefore, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,453],"elapsed":8.012033804,"_type":"aimessage"}]
