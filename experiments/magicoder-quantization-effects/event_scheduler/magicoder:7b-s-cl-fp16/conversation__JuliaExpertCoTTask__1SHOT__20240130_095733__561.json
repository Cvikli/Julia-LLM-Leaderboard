For simplicity, we use Dates.DateTime to parse and compare dates. We start by creating a function `event_scheduler` that takes as input an array of tuples representing events where each tuple contains two strings representing start and end times. \n\nInside this function, for every pair of events, we first parse the string times into DateTime objects using Dates.DateTime(). Then we compare these datetime objects to check if there is any overlap in their ranges.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    for i in 1:length(events)-1\n        start1, end1 = DateTime.(events[i])\n        start2, end2 = DateTime.(events[i+1])\n        \n        if !isnothing(start1) && !isnothing(end1) && !isnothing(start2) && !isnothing(end2)\n            if (start1 <= end2) || (start2 <= end1)\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        else\n            return \"Invalid event format\"\n        end \n    end\n    \n    length(events) == 0 ? \"No events\" : \"No conflicts\"   # If there are no events, return 'No events'. Otherwise, return 'No conflicts'\nend\n```\n\nIf you run this function with the provided data as follows:\n\n```julia\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\nThe function should return \"Conflict\" because there is an overlap between the second event's start time and the first event's end time.","status":200,"tokens":[0,431],"elapsed":7.742337907,"_type":"aimessage"}]
