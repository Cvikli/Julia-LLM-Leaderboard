Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

It then sorts the events chronologically by start time. After sorting, it iterates through the sorted events to check for any overlapping events. If an event's start time falls within another event's time range (plus or minus 5 milliseconds to account for possible rounding errors), it returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of events, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,319],"elapsed":5.562819059,"_type":"aimessage"}]
