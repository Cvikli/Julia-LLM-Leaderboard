If it is, we return \"No events\". Then we sort the events based on their start times. After that, we iterate through each event and compare its start time with the end time of the previous event. If any event starts before the end of the previous one, then there's a conflict. In such case, we return \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all events, we return \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,266],"elapsed":4.633579904,"_type":"aimessage"}]
