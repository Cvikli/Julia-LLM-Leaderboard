Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple Python solution using the `Dates` library:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef event_scheduler(events):\n    if not events:\n        return 'No events'\n    \n    df = pd.DataFrame(events, columns=['Start', 'End'])\n    df['Start'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Start'])\n    df['End'] = pd.to_datetime(df['End'])\n    \n    for i in range(len(df)):\n        if (df['Start'].iloc[i] < df['End'].iloc[(i+1)%len(df)]).any():\n            return 'Conflict'\n            \n    return 'No conflicts'\n```\nThis function first checks if the list is empty. If it is, it returns \"No events\". It then converts the start and end times into datetime objects using pandas. After that, it iterates through each event checking if any of its start time is less than the end time of the next event. If there's a conflict (i.e., the start time of one event is later than the end time of another), it returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the events are sorted by their start times in ascending order. If they aren't, you should sort them before passing to `event_scheduler`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,314],"elapsed":5.435514043,"_type":"aimessage"}]
