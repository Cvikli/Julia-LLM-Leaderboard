The function uses the Dates package to parse date and time strings into DateTime objects, which can be compared for ordering and overlapping.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Array{Tuple{String, String}, 1})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort([DateTime.(event[1] .* DateTime.(event[2])) for event in events], by=x->x.start)\n    last_end = sorted_events[1].start\n    \n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if sorted_events[i].start < last_end\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n        \n        last_end = max(last_end, sorted_events[i].finish)\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list of events is empty. If it is, it returns \"No events\". Otherwise, it sorts the events by their start times and then iterates through them. For each event, it checks whether its start time is less than the end time of the previous event. If it is, that means there's a conflict, so it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If not, it updates the last_end variable to be the maximum of the current event's finish time and the last_end value. After checking all events, if no conflicts were found, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,345],"elapsed":6.016616277,"_type":"aimessage"}]
