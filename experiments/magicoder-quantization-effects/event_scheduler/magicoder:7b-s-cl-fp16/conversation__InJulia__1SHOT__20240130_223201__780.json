[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If it is, it returns \"No events\". Otherwise, it sorts the events based on their start time and then iterates through them. For each event, it compares its start time with the end time of the previous event. If a conflict exists (i.e., an event starts before the previous one ends), it returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all the events, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the input dates are in UTC and does not account for time zones or daylight saving time changes.","status":200,"tokens":[0,347],"elapsed":5.994398882,"_type":"aimessage"}]
