Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function that solves the problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    sorted_events = sort(events, by=first)\n\n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if timeoverlaps(sorted_events[i-1], sorted_events[i])\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\nfunction timeoverlaps(e1, e2)\n    start1 = DateTime(e1[1], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n    finish1 = DateTime(e1[2], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n    \n    start2 = DateTime(e2[1], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n    finish2 = DateTime(e2[2], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n    \n    return (start1 < finish2 && start2 < finish1)\nend\n```\n\nThe `event_scheduler` function first checks if the list of events is empty. If it's not, it sorts the events by their start time and then iterates through them, checking for overlaps using the helper function `timeoverlaps`. The `timeoverlaps` function takes two events as input, converts their start and finish times to DateTime objects, and checks if they overlap.\n\nThe timeoverlaps function returns true if the start of event 1 is before the end of event 2 and vice versa.","status":200,"tokens":[0,366],"elapsed":6.385756901,"_type":"aimessage"}]
