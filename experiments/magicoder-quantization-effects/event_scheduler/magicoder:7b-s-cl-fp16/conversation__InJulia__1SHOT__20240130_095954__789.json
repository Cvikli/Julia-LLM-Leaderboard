If it is, it returns \"No events\". It then sorts the events based on their start times and iterates over them. For each event, it compares the end time of the last event to see whether there's any overlap with the current event. If the next event starts after the last ends, it updates the last_end variable to be equal to the finish time of this event; if not, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". It then returns \"No conflicts\" if it's able to iterate through all events without finding any overlaps.","status":200,"tokens":[0,361],"elapsed":6.291261234,"_type":"aimessage"}]
