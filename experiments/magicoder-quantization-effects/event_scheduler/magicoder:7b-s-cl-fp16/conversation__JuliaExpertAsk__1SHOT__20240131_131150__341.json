Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution using Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort([DateTime(event[1] * \"T\" * event[2]) for event in events], lt=(a, b) -> a < b)\n\n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if DateTime(string(sorted_events[i-1])) <= DateTime(string(sorted_events[i]))\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first sorting all the event times in ascending order. Then it checks each subsequent pair of events to see if they overlap in time (if the start time of one is before the end time of the other). If any pair overlaps, it returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nPlease note that we are assuming 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM' as a string and not DateTime object. This function works with DateTime objects directly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,263],"elapsed":4.549874752,"_type":"aimessage"}]
