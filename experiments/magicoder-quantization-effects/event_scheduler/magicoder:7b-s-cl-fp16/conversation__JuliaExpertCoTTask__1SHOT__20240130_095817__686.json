Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem using the Dates package in Julia. The function `event_scheduler` loops through each event and checks if it overlaps with any other events. If an overlap is detected, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all events, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nHere's a solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Array{Tuple{String, String},1})\n    if isempty(events) \n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    for i in 1:(length(events)-1)\n        start = DateTime(events[i][1], dateformat\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n        finish = DateTime(events[i][2], dateformat\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n        \n        for j in (i+1):length(events)\n            if start < DateTime(events[j][2], dateformat\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\") && \n               finish > DateTime(events[j][1], dateformat\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function will correctly find scheduling conflicts. If you want to ensure the events are sorted by start time before checking for conflicts, you could use `sort!(events)` at the beginning of the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,330],"elapsed":5.843344554,"_type":"aimessage"}]
