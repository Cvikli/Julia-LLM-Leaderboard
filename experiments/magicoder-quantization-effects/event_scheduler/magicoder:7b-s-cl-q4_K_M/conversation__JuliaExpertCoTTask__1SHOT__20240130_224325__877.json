Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

This function uses the Dates package to parse the date and time strings into DateTime objects, which are then used to compare for conflicts.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    for i in 1:length(events)\n        start_time, finish_time = parse.(DateTime, [events[i][1], events[i][2]])\n        \n        for j in (i+1):length(events)\n            other_start, other_finish = parse.(DateTime, [events[j][1], events[j][2]])\n            \n            if start_time < other_finish && finish_time > other_start\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each event in the list, and then comparing it with every subsequent event. If any two events overlap in time (i.e., if their start times are less than or equal to the finish time of the other event), they have a conflict. If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of events, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,290],"elapsed":2.314448314,"_type":"aimessage"}]
