The function `event_scheduler` takes an array of tuples as input, where each tuple represents an event with its start and finish times. It checks if any two events overlap in time by comparing their start and end times. If there are no overlapping events, it returns \"No conflicts\". Otherwise, it returns \"Conflict\".\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    else\n        for i in 1:length(events)-1\n            start1 = DateTime(split(events[i][1], ' ')[2])\n            finish1 = DateTime(split(events[i][2], ' ')[2])\n            \n            for j in (i+1):length(events)\n                start2 = DateTime(split(events[j][1], ' ')[2])\n                finish2 = DateTime(split(events[j][2], ' ')[2])\n                \n                if !isnothing(intersect((start1,finish1), (start2,finish2)))\n                    return \"Conflict\"\n                end\n            end\n        end\n        \n        return \"No conflicts\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nYou can test the function with the provided data:\n\n```julia\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\n\nThis should return \"Conflict\" because the first event overlaps with the second one.","status":200,"tokens":[0,406],"elapsed":3.258546382,"_type":"aimessage"}]
