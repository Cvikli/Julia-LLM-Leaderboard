[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

If it is, we return \"No events\". Then for each event, we convert its start and finish times into `Date` objects using the `DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")` format. After that, we loop through every other event to see if there's any overlap with the current one. If there is, we return \"Conflict\". If there isn't, we move on to check the next event. If no conflicts are found after checking all events, we return \"No conflicts\".\n\nYou can call this function with a list of tuples representing your events like so: `event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-25 10:30\", \"2023-12-25 11:30\"), (\"2023-12-26 09:00\", \"2023-12-26 12:00\")])`. This will return `\"No conflicts\"`, as there are no overlapping events.","status":200,"tokens":[0,490],"elapsed":4.056256556,"_type":"aimessage"}]
