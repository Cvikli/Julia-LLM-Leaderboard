We'll use the `Dates` module in Julia for parsing and manipulating date/time strings.\n\nFirstly, let's import the required modules:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n```\n\nThen we can define our function as follows:\n\n```julia\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Array{Tuple{String, String}, 1})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    for i in 1:length(events)\n        start_time = DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm\")\n        finish_time = DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm\")\n        events[i] = (start_time.parse(first(events[i])), finish_time.parse(last(events[i])))\n    end\n\n    for i in 1:(length(events)-1)\n        if !isnothing(findmin((events[i][2], events[i+1][1]), (events[i+1][2], events[i][1]))[2]) # check if there's overlap\n            return \"Conflict\" \n        end\n    end\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function goes through each event and parses the start and finish time from string format into Date objects. It then checks for any overlapping events by comparing the start and finish times of adjacent events. If it finds an overlap, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If it doesn't find any overlaps after checking all pairs of events, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nLastly, we test our function with the given data:\n```julia\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\nThis will return \"Conflict\" as there's an overlap between the two events.","status":200,"tokens":[0,492],"elapsed":4.06302459,"_type":"aimessage"}]
