[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If it finds an overlap, it returns \"Conflict\". If no overlaps are found after checking all possible pairs of events, it returns \"No conflicts\". \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the input is a list of tuples where the first element of each tuple is the start time and the second element is the end time. The `parse` function from the Dates package is used to convert these strings into DateTime objects.","status":200,"tokens":[0,293],"elapsed":2.273750592,"_type":"aimessage"}]
