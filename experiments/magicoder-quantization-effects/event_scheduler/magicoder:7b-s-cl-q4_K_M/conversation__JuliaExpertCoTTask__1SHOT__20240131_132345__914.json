Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

For each event, it splits the start and finish times into separate `DateTime` objects. It then checks if there is any overlap with other events (by checking for intersection of time ranges). If an overlap is found, it returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of events, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nYou can run this function with the given data as follows:\n\n```julia\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,439],"elapsed":3.5784421,"_type":"aimessage"}]
