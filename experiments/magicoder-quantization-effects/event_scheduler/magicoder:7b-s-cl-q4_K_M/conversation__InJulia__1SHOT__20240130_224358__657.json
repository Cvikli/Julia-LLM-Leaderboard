If it is, it returns \"No events\". \n\nThen, for each event in the list, it parses the start and finish times into DateTime objects. It then compares these times with every other event's times to check for any overlapping events. If there are any overlaps, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". \n\nIf no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of events, it finally returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[123,296],"elapsed":2.346208125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
