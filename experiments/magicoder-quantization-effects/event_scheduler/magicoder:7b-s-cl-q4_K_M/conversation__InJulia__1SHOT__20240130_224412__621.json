If it's not, then for each event it compares with every other event to see if there are any overlapping events. If an overlap is found, it returns \"Conflict\". If no overlaps are found after checking all pairs of events, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nNote: This function assumes that the list of events is sorted by start time. If the list isn't sorted, you would need to sort it before running this function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,407],"elapsed":3.202938813,"_type":"aimessage"}]
