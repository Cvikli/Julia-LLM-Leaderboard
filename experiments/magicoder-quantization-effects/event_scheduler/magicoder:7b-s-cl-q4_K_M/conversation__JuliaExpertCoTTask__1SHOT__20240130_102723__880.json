Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem using Julia's Dates package to parse the time strings and then compare them. Here is an example of how you might write the `event_scheduler` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    for i in 1:(length(events)-1)\n        start_i = DateTime(events[i][1])\n        finish_i = DateTime(events[i][2])\n        \n        for j in (i+1):length(events)\n            start_j = DateTime(events[j][1])\n            finish_j = DateTime(events[j][2])\n            \n            if isless(start_i, finish_j) && isless(start_j, finish_i)\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each pair of events and checking if their start time is before the end time of the other event. If it finds any pairs that overlap, it returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it finally returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nYou can test this function using your given data:\n```julia\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,382],"elapsed":3.135121006,"_type":"aimessage"}]
