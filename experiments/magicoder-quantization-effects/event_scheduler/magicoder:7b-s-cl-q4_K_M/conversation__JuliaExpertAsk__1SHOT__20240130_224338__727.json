Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution using Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort(events, by=x -> x[1]) # Sort the events based on start time\n    \n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        prev_event_end = DateTime(sorted_events[i-1][2], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n        \n        if sorted_events[i][1] < prev_event_end # If the start time of current event is before end of previous one\n            return \"Conflict\" \n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks whether the list is empty. If it's not, it sorts the events based on their start times. Then it iterates over each event and checks if its start time is before the end of the previous one. If it is, that means there's a conflict, so it returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all the events, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the input list only contains tuples with two elements each (start and end times), and that these times are in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'.","status":200,"tokens":[0,315],"elapsed":2.473737823,"_type":"aimessage"}]
