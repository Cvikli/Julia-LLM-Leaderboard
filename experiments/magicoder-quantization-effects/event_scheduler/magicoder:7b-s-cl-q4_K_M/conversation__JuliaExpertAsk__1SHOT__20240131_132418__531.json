Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef event_scheduler(events):\n    # Check if there are no events\n    if not events:\n        return \"No events\"\n    \n    # Sort the events by start time\n    sorted_events = sorted(events, key=lambda x: x[0])\n    \n    for i in range(len(sorted_events) - 1):\n        event1 = sorted_events[i]\n        event2 = sorted_events[i+1]\n        \n        # If the start time of the next event is earlier than the end time of the current one, there's a conflict\n        if datetime.strptime(event2[0], '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M') <= datetime.strptime(event1[1], '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'):\n            return \"Conflict\"\n    \n    # If there are no conflicts, return \"No conflicts\"\n    return \"No conflicts\"\n```\nThis function first checks if the list of events is empty. If it's not, it sorts the events by their start times. Then it goes through each pair of consecutive events and checks if the end time of one event is earlier or equal to the start time of the next one. If this condition is true, there's a conflict, so it returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it continues with the next pair of events until all pairs have been checked. If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,341],"elapsed":2.725892443,"_type":"aimessage"}]
