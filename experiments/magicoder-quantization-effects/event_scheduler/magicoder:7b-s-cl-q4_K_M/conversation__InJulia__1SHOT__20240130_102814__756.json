[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If any overlap is found, it returns \"Conflict\". If there are no overlaps, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n  \nFor example: \n```julia\nevents = [(\"2022-12-31 16:00\", \"2022-12-31 17:00\"), (\"2022-12-31 15:00\", \"2022-12-31 16:00\")]\n@show event_scheduler(events) # returns \"No conflicts\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,391],"elapsed":3.158881717,"_type":"aimessage"}]
