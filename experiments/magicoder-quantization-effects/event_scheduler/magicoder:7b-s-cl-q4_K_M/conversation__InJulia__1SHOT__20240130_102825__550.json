You can do it with this command: `]add Dates`.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    for i in 1:(length(events)-1)\n        start_i, finish_i = events[i]\n        start_i = parse(DateTime, start_i, dateformat\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n        finish_i = parse(DateTime, finish_i, dateformat\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n        \n        for j in (i+1):length(events)\n            start_j, finish_j = events[j]\n            start_j = parse(DateTime, start_j, dateformat\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n            finish_j = parse(DateTime, finish_j, dateformat\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n            \n            if !isnothing(intersect((start_i, finish_i), (start_j, finish_j)))\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function iterates over each pair of events. For each pair, it checks for any overlap in time by checking if the start and finish times of both events intersects with each other. If there is an intersection, it means that the events have a conflict and the function returns \"Conflict\". If no intersections are found across all pairs, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the input `events` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a start time and finish time. The dates are in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'. If your input has different formatting or structure you will need to adjust accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,446],"elapsed":3.612841068,"_type":"aimessage"}]
