Then it sorts the events based on their start time. It then iterates over each event (except for the first one), and checks if its start time is before or equal to the end time of the previous event. If so, there's a conflict and it returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all events, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the input list of events is correctly formatted (i.e., each event is a tuple with two strings: the start time and end time). It also assumes that the times are in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'.","status":200,"tokens":[0,370],"elapsed":2.907645777,"_type":"aimessage"}]
