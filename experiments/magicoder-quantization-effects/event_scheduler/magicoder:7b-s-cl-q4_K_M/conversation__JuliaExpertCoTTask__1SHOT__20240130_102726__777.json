Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the function in Julia using Dates package for parsing and comparison of DateTimes.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    times = DateTime[]\n    for e in events\n        push!(times, DateTime.(e[1], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"))\n        push!(times, DateTime.(e[2], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"))\n    end\n\n    sorted_times = sort(times)\n    \n    for i in 2:length(sorted_times)\n        if sorted_times[i] < sorted_times[i - 1]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        elseif sorted_times[i] == sorted_times[i - 1]\n            return \"No conflicts\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we first check if the events list is empty.
