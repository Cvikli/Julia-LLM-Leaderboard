Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

This function uses a custom type for representing events, which allows for easier comparison of event times. The events are stored in a list (Vector) to make it easy to loop over each event and compare it with others.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nstruct Event\n    start_time::DateTime\n    finish_time::DateTime\nend\n\nfunction check_for_conflicts(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    for i in 1:length(events)\n        event1 = events[i]\n        \n        for j in (i+1):length(events)\n            event2 = events[j]\n            \n            if !isnothing(intersect((event1.start_time, event1.finish_time), (event2.start_time, event2.finish_time)))\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\nevents = [Event(DateTime(\"2023-12-01T09:00\"), DateTime(\"2023-12-01T11:00\")), Event(DateTime(\"2023-12-01T11:30\"), DateTime(\"2023-12-01T12:30\"))]\nprintln(check_for_conflicts(events))  # should print \"Conflict\"\n```\nThis function works by iterating through the list of events, checking for conflicts with every other event. It uses the DateTime type from Dates to compare times. Note that this solution is fairly efficient if you have a large number of events and it can be optimized further if necessary.","status":200,"tokens":[0,406],"elapsed":3.348052704,"_type":"aimessage"}]
