Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia solution to the problem using Dates package.\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    for i in 1:length(events)\n        start_time = DateTime(events[i][1], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n        finish_time = DateTime(events[i][2], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n        \n        for j in (i+1):length(events)\n            if (start_time <= DateTime(events[j][2], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")) && (finish_time >= DateTime(events[j][1], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"))\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function works by first checking if the events list is empty. If it's empty, it returns \"No events\". Then it goes through each event in the list and checks for any overlapping events with other events. If there are overlapping events, it returns \"Conflict\" immediately. Otherwise, it continues to check for conflicts and if no conflict is found after checking all pairs of events, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[343,303],"elapsed":7.319044725,"_type":"aimessage"}]
