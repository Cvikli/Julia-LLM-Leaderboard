Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you might solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    for i in 1:length(events)\n        for j in (i+1):length(events)\n            start_event_i = DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd hh:mi\")\n                .parse(events[i][1])\n            finish_event_i = DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd hh:mi\")\n                .parse(events[i][2])\n            \n            start_event_j = DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd hh:mi\")\n                .parse(events[j][1])\n            finish_event_j = DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd hh:mi\")\n                .parse(events[j][2])\n            \n            if start_event_i <= finish_event_j && \n               finish_event_i >= start_event_j\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function iterates through each event in the list, comparing its start and finish times with every subsequent event's. If it finds a pair of events that overlap, it returns \"Conflict\". If it makes it through all the pairs without finding any conflicts, it returns \"No conflicts\". \n\nPlease note: This function is case-sensitive when parsing strings to `Date` object and might fail if your input format does not match the required one. You should handle these edge cases according to your requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,379],"elapsed":3.067684587,"_type":"aimessage"}]
