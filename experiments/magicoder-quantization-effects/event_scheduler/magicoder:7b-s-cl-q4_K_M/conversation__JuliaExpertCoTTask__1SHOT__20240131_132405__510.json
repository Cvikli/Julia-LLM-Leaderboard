Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Then it iterates through each event, comparing its start and finish times to all previous events. If any event's finish time is later than a previous event's start time, then there's an overlap, so it returns \"Conflict\". If no overlaps are found after checking all the events, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,329],"elapsed":2.670321595,"_type":"aimessage"}]
