Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

We'll parse our time strings into a format which we can easily compare with other parsed time strings. \n\nHere is the solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    for i in 1:length(events)\n        event = events[i]\n        \n        start_time = DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")(event[1])\n        finish_time = DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")(event[2])\n\n        for j in i+1:length(events)\n            other_event = events[j]\n            \n            other_start = DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")(other_event[1])\n            other_finish = DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")(other_event[2])\n\n            # check if start or finish times overlap with current event \n            if (start_time < other_finish) && (finish_time > other_start)\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the events list is empty. If it is, it returns \"No events\". Then it loops through each event in our list. For each event, we parse its start and finish times into DateFormat instances which can be compared with other events' start and finish times using standard comparison operators. If there are any overlapping events (if the current event's start time is earlier than the other event's finish time and vice versa), it returns \"Conflict\". If all events pass this check, then no conflicts are found, so it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nPlease note that you must use `using Dates` at the beginning of your code to bring in Date formatting support. Also, you may need to handle potential errors or invalid inputs depending on how robust your actual program needs to be.","status":200,"tokens":[0,501],"elapsed":4.189779508,"_type":"aimessage"}]
