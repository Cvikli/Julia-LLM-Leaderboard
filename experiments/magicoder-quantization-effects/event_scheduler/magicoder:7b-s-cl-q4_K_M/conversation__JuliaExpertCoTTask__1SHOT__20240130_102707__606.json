Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

We will use the `Date` and `Time` types from the Dates package for parsing and comparison. Here is the solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    # check for empty list\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    # convert string to DateTime\n    parsed_events = [DateTime.(parse.(Time, split(event[1], \" \"), dateformat\"yy-mm-dd HH:MM\")) for event in events]\n    \n    # go through each event and check if it overlaps with any other event\n    for i in 1:length(parsed_events)\n        for j in (i+1):length(parsed_events)\n            if parsed_events[i] <= parsed_events[j] < parsed_events[i]+HourOne && parsed_events[j] <= parsed_events[i+1] < parsed_events[j]+HourOne\n                return \"Conflict\"  # overlapping event found\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"  # no overlapping events found\nend\n```\nThis function works by first checking if the list of events is empty. If it is, it returns `\"No events\"`. It then converts each string in the list to a DateTime type and stores them in `parsed_events`. It then goes through each event pair (comparing only pairs where the first event's end time comes before the second one's start time), checks if they overlap, and returns `\"Conflict\"` if they do. If it doesn't find any overlapping events, it returns `\"No conflicts\"`.\n\nNote: Here we are considering 1 hour as our `HourOne` for simplicity. You might want to adjust this based on your requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,443],"elapsed":3.659348367,"_type":"aimessage"}]
