[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

It does this by comparing each event's start time to every other event's start and finish times, and if any of these comparisons result in an overlap, it returns \"Conflict\". If no overlaps are found after checking all pairs of events, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nThe `DateFormat` function is used to parse the date strings into Date objects, which can be compared with each other. The comparison checks for cases where one event starts before and ends during another event (overlap at start), finishes during another event (overlap in middle), or finishes after another event (overlap at end).\n\nThe function also handles the case of an empty list of events, returning \"No events\" if there are no events to check for conflicts.","status":200,"tokens":[0,458],"elapsed":3.789925603,"_type":"aimessage"}]
