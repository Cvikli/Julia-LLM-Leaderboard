Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you might write this function using Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Array{Tuple{String, String}, 1})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    for i in 1:(length(events)-1)\n        ev1 = DateTime.(split(events[i][1], ' '))\n        ev2 = DateTime.(split(events[i+1][1], ' '))\n        \n        if (ev1[2]>ev2[1]) || (ev2[2]>ev1[1])\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nIn this function, we first check whether the input list is empty or not. If it's empty, we return 'No events'. Then for each pair of events (ev1 and ev2), if the start time of ev2 is earlier than the finish time of ev1 or vice versa, we return 'Conflict' since there is a conflict between these two events. If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of events, we return 'No conflicts'.","status":200,"tokens":[0,273],"elapsed":2.214706005,"_type":"aimessage"}]
