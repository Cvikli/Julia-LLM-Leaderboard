If it is, then it simply returns the string \"No events\". It sorts the array in ascending order by start time for simplicity. Then it iterates over each event and compares its start and finish times with all previous events. If there is any overlap, it immediately returns the string \"Conflict\", indicating that there's a conflict among the events. \n\nPlease note that this function only checks for strict conflicts (events that begin before and end after another event). It does not consider edge cases where two events are at the exact same start or finish time, which would also be considered as a conflict by some conventions. Also, it assumes that all events have the same format and do not contain any invalid times.","status":200,"tokens":[123,476],"elapsed":3.643149278,"_type":"aimessage"}]
