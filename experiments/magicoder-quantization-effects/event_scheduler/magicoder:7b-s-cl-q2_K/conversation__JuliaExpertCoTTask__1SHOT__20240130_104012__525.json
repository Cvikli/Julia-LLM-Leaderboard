In this solution, we iterate through each event and compare it with every other event to check for overlapping times.

If it finds a pair of events where one starts before another ends, or one finishes after the other begins, it immediately returns that there is a conflict. It continues to check all pairs until it has checked every event with every other event. \n\nWhen all comparisons are made, if no conflicts were found, it then returns \"No conflicts\". If any conflicts were found during this process, it immediately returns \"Conflict\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,352],"elapsed":2.715448439,"_type":"aimessage"}]
