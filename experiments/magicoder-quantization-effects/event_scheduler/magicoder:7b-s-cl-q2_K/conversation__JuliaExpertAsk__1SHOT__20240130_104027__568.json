Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Python solution:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\nimport datetime as dt\n\ndef event_scheduler(events: List[Tuple[str, str]]) -> str:\n    if not events: return \"No events\"\n    \n    sorted_events = sorted(events, key=lambda x: (dt.datetime.strptime(x[0], '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'), dt.datetime.strptime(x[1], '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')))\n    \n    for i in range(len(sorted_events) - 1):\n        if max(dt.datetime.strptime(sorted_events[i][0], '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'), dt.datetime.strptime(sorted_events[i+1][0], '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')) <= min(dt.datetime.strptime(sorted_events[i][1], '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'), dt.datetime.strptime(sorted_events[i+1][1], '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')):\n            return \"Conflict\"  # Overlapping events found\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"  # No overlapping events found\n```\n\nThis function first sorts the list of tuples by start times. It then iterates through the sorted list and checks for any overlap in the start or end times of consecutive events. If there's an overlap, it returns 'Conflict'. If no conflicts are detected after checking all pairs of events, it returns 'No conflicts'.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that all events have valid time formats and does not handle edge cases where dates might be incorrectly formatted. In a production environment, you would want to add error handling for these potential issues.","status":200,"tokens":[0,410],"elapsed":3.113200083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
