Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could implement this using Julia:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Array{Tuple{Date, Date}, 1})\n    if isempty(events) return \"No events\" end\n\n    sorted = sort([start for (start,finish) in events], lt)\n    \n    previous_event = first(sorted)\n    for event in sorted[2:end]\n        if event <= previous_event\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        else\n            previous_event = event\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function sorts the events by their start time, then checks each one to see if it overlaps with any of the preceding ones. If there are any overlapping events, the function returns \"Conflict\". If not, it will return \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,201],"elapsed":1.51718928,"_type":"aimessage"}]
