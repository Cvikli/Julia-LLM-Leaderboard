Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the code that solves the task:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Array{Tuple{String, String}, 1})\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    sorted_events = sort(events, by=first) # Sorting the events based on start time\n\n    for i in 1:length(sorted_events)-1\n        start_event = parse.(Date, [sorted_events[i][1], sorted_events[i+1][1]]) |> collect\n        finish_event = parse.(Date, [sorted_events[i][2], sorted_events[i+1][2]]) |> collect\n\n        # Checking if the next event overlaps with current event based on start and finish times\n        if (start_event[2] <= finish_event[1]) || (start_event[1] >= finish_event[2])\n            return \"Conflict\" \n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nIn this solution, the function takes in a list of tuples representing events. The dates are then parsed into Date format. The sorted_events array holds the events sorted by their start times. Then, for each pair of consecutive events, we check if there is any overlap in time. If yes, it returns \"Conflict\". If no overlap is found after checking all pairs of consecutive events, it returns \"No conflicts\" indicating that there are no overlapping events.","status":200,"tokens":[0,342],"elapsed":2.630601643,"_type":"aimessage"}]
