Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is a Python solution that uses the `sortedcontainers` module to handle the scheduling conflicts:\n\n```python\nfrom sortedcontainers import SortedDict\nimport datetime as dt\n\ndef event_scheduler(events):\n    if not events:\n        return \"No events\"\n    \n    # Create a tree map of events where each event is mapped to its start time.\n    tree = SortedDict() \n    \n    for event in events:\n        start, end = dt.datetime.strptime(event[0], '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'), dt.datetime.strptime(event[1], '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M') \n        \n        # Check if the current event overlaps with any existing events in the tree.\n        for time, _ in tree.items():\n            if start < time and start > tree[time-dt.timedelta(minutes=1)]: \n                return \"Conflict\"  # Overlap detected\n            \n        # Add the start time to the tree and end time of current event.\n        tree[start] = end\n        \n    return \"No conflicts\"  # No conflict found\n```\nThis function first creates an empty dictionary, where each key-value pair is a start time and its corresponding end time. Then for each event, it checks if the start time overlaps with any other events in the tree. If there's overlap, it returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it adds the start time and end time to the tree. If there are no events (i.e., `events` is empty), it returns \"No events\".\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that all events are sorted by their start times in ascending order. The sorting step can be included in another function if necessary before calling this function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,401],"elapsed":3.050098869,"_type":"aimessage"}]
