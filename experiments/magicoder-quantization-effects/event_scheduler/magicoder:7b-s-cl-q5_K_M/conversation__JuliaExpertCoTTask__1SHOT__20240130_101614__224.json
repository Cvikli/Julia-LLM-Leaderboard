Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Then it sorts the events by their start times. The main loop goes through each event in order, comparing its start time with the previous event's start time. If any start time is earlier than the previous one, that means there's a conflict between the current event and the previous one.","status":200,"tokens":[0,275],"elapsed":2.463734681,"_type":"aimessage"}]
