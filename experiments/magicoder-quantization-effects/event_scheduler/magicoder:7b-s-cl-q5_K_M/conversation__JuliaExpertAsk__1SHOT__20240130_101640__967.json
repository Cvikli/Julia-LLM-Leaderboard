Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of a solution using Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Array{Tuple{String, String}, 1})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    sorted_events = sort([DateTime.(event[1]):Dates.Minute(1):DateTime(event[2]) for event in events]; by=first)\n    \n    conflict = false\n\n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if DateTime(sorted_events[i-1].stop) > DateTime(sorted_events[i].start) || DateTime(sorted_events[i-1].stop) == DateTime(sorted_events[i].start)\n            conflict = true\n            break\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return conflict ? \"Conflict\" : \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first sorting the event tuples by start time. It then checks for any events that overlap by seeing if a current event's end date overlaps with the next event's start date, or if they share the same start/stop point. If there are any conflicts, it returns \"Conflict\"; otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nPlease note that this function considers two events overlapping if one ends at the exact same moment as another starts.","status":200,"tokens":[0,309],"elapsed":2.728810209,"_type":"aimessage"}]
