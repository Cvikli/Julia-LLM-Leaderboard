[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If any pair overlaps, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no pairs overlap, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nIn the nested for loop, `(event_start - start)` and `(event_finish - finish)` are used to check if the times for the events overlap. `Zero()` is a constant from the Dates package that represents an interval of 0 days (or in other words, no time).","status":200,"tokens":[0,399],"elapsed":3.502172333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
