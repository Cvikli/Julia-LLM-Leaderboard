Here's how you could write the `event_scheduler` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    # check if events list is empty\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    for i = 1:length(events)\n        dt1, dt2 = map(Date, split.(Ref(events[i][1]), ' ')) # split date and time\n        dt3, dt4 = map(Date, split.(Ref(events[i][2]), ' ')) # split date and time\n        \n        events[i] = (DateTime(dt1, dt2), DateTime(dt3, dt4))  # convert to DateTime type\n    end\n    \n    for i = 1:(length(events)-1)\n        for j = (i+1):length(events)\n            if !isempty(intersect(events[i][1]:Hour(1):events[i][2], events[j][1]:Hour(1):events[j][2])) # check for overlapping time\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"  # if no conflict is found\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list of events is empty. If it's not, it converts each event tuple into a DateTime type and then compares each event with every other event to see if they overlap. The `intersect` function finds any common times between two date ranges, and an empty range (i.e., no intersecting hours) indicates that there are no overlapping events.","status":200,"tokens":[0,417],"elapsed":3.74407804,"_type":"aimessage"}]
