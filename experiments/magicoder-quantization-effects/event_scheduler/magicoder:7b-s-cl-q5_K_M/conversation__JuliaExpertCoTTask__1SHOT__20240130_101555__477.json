Then it checks each pair of consecutive events for a conflict, by comparing the finish time of the previous event with the start time of the next event.

If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of events, it finally returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,344],"elapsed":3.097156965,"_type":"aimessage"}]
