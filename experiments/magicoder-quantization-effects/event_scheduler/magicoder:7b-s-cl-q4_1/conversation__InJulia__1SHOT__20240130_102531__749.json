[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If it finds such an overlap, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". \n\nPlease note that this function does not check if events have same start times but different finish times because in time-table scheduling all such cases would be treated as conflicts. Also, it assumes the event list is sorted by start time.","status":200,"tokens":[0,288],"elapsed":2.335375245,"_type":"aimessage"}]
