Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use Python's `datetime` module to parse the dates and perform checks on them. Here's a simple function that solves your problem:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport operator \n\ndef event_scheduler(event_list):\n    if not event_list:\n        return \"No events\"\n    \n    for i in range(len(event_list)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(event_list)):\n            start_i = datetime.strptime(event_list[i][0], \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M\")\n            finish_i = datetime.strptime(event_list[i][1], \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M\")\n            start_j = datetime.strptime(event_list[j][0], \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M\")\n            finish_j = datetime.strptime(event_list[j][1], \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M\")\n            \n            # If events overlap, return conflict\n            if start_i < finish_j and start_j < finish_i:\n                return \"Conflict\"\n                \n    # No conflicts found        \n    return \"No conflicts\" \n```\nThis function goes through all pairs of events in the list. For each pair, it compares their start and finish times. If a pair overlaps (start time of one is before the end of the other, and vice versa), it returns \"Conflict\". If no such pair is found after checking all pairs, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the events are non-overlapping if they start at the same time or finish at the same time. If you want to consider overlapping events with the same starting and finishing times as not overlapping (i.e., one event is completely inside another), you would need a slightly more complex algorithm.","status":200,"tokens":[153,429],"elapsed":3.514877101,"_type":"aimessage"}]
