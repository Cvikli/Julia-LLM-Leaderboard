Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible solution written in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    sorted_events = sort([DateTime(s) => DateTime(f) for (s, f) in events])\n    current_event = first(sorted_events)\n\n    for event in sorted_events[2:end]\n        if event.value <= current_event.value + Second(59*60) # 59 minutes to account for time differences\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        else\n            current_event = event\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis program first checks if the list of events is empty, and returns a message accordingly. If there are some events, it sorts them by their start times, then iterates through each event to check for any overlap with the current event being processed (stored in `current_event`). It uses a buffer of 59 minutes to account for the difference between two events' finish times and their start times. If at any point an overlap is found, it returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, if all events are checked without overlaps, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nYou can run this function with your example by typing `event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])` in your Julia REPL.","status":200,"tokens":[0,381],"elapsed":3.14332342,"_type":"aimessage"}]
