Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function that solves the problem.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    parsed_events = [DateTime.(split.(event, ' ')[1]) for event in events]\n    times = Vector{Tuple}(undef, length(parsed_events))\n\n    for (i, event) in enumerate(parsed_events)\n        times[i] = (earliest(event), latest(event))\n    end\n    \n    sorted_times = sort(times)\n\n    for i = 1:length(sorted_times)-1\n        if earliest(sorted_times[i]) < latest(sorted_times[i+1])\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function first parses the string into `DateTime` objects for each event. It then creates an array of tuples where each tuple contains the earliest and latest times for each event. It sorts this array and checks each pair of adjacent events to see if there is a conflict (if the earliest time of one event is later than the latest time of the previous one). If it finds any conflicts, it returns \"Conflict\". If all events are non-overlapping with respect to each other, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n  \nNote that `earliest(event)` and `latest(event)` are helper functions for getting earliest and latest times from a tuple of start and end times.","status":200,"tokens":[0,359],"elapsed":2.938180359,"_type":"aimessage"}]
