Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem by sorting all events based on their start times then iterating through the sorted list of events. If an event's start time is greater than or equal to the end time of a previous event then there is no overlap and we move on to check the next event otherwise there is a conflict. Below is a Python solution using `Dates` package:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nfrom dateutil import parser\n\ndef event_scheduler(events):\n    if not events:  # if list is empty\n        return \"No events\"\n    \n    sorted_events = sorted(events, key=lambda x: parser.parse(x[0]))  # parse string to datetime and sort by start time\n    \n    for i in range(1, len(sorted_events)):\n        event = sorted_events[i]\n        \n        if parser.parse(event[0]) >= parser.parse(sorted_events[i-1][1]):  # if no overlap\n            return \"Conflict\"\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\n```\n\nThe `parser.parse()` function parses the input string into a datetime object, allowing for comparison and sorting. It's assumed that an event starts at the start of a time slot (hour or half hour depending on the format) and ends at the end of that time slot, hence the comparison check is based on the starting times.","status":200,"tokens":[0,312],"elapsed":2.520419421,"_type":"aimessage"}]
