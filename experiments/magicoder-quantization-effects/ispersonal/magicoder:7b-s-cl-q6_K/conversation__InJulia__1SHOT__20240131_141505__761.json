We then define two functions `ispersonal` for different types. The first function is for types that are either `Car` or `Motorcycle`, and it returns true. The second function is for all other types of `AbstractVehicle` and it returns false.\n\nYou can test the function as follows:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(typeof(Car()))\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(typeof(Bus()))\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(typeof(Truck()))\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(typeof(Motorcycle()))\ntrue\n```","status":200,"tokens":[112,306],"elapsed":2.94826723,"_type":"aimessage"}]
