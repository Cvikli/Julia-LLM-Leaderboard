All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can define such a function in Julia:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Car)\n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Motorcycle)\n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Bus)\n    return false\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Truck)\n    return false\nend\n```\n\nYou can call the function for different types like this:\n```julia\nispersonal(Car()) # returns true\nispersonal(Motorcycle()) # returns true\nispersonal(Bus()) # returns false\nispersonal(Truck()) # returns false\n```\n\nThis is a simple example. Depending on your needs, you may need to add more subtypes or change the trait of some vehicles. You can also add an extra argument in `ispersonal` function for passing custom parameters if needed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,254],"elapsed":2.485875212,"_type":"aimessage"}]
