All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The function `ispersonal(v::T)` checks the type of `v` and returns `true` if it's a subtype of `Car` or `Motorcycle`, and `false` otherwise.\n\nFor example, calling `ispersonal(Car())` will return `true`, because `Car` is a subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. Calling `ispersonal(Truck())` will return `false`, because `Truck` is not a subtype of `Car` or `Motorcycle`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,289],"elapsed":2.771569209,"_type":"aimessage"}]
