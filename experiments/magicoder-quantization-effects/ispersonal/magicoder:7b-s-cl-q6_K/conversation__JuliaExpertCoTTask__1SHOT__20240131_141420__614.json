All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

For types `Car` and `Motorcycle`, it returns true because they are typically used for everyday driving. On the other hand, for types `Bus` and `Truck`, it returns false because they are generally used for commercial purposes. The default case for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle` is also defined to return false.\n\nYou can test this function with an example as follows:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(AbstractVehicle()) # This will return false because the default case was defined to be false.\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,378],"elapsed":3.65418145,"_type":"aimessage"}]
