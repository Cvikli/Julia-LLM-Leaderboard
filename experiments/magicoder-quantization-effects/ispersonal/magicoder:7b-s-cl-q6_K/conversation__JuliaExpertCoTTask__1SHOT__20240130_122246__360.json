All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Then we create several subtypes `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus` and `Truck`. Each one of them is a subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.\n\nWe then define our function `ispersonal`, which checks the type of vehicle input and returns `true` or `false` as per the problem statement.\n\nFinally, we use this function to check the personality trait of different vehicles types. For example, a car and motorcycle are personal vehicles so `ispersonal(Car())` and `ispersonal(Motorcycle())` both return `true`. But buses and trucks are not used for everyday driving so `ispersonal(Bus())` and `ispersonal(Truck())` each return `false`.\n\nFor any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, the function defaults to false, as specified by `ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T <: AbstractVehicle} = false`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,501],"elapsed":4.987832961,"_type":"aimessage"}]
