All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Then, we define the function `ispersonal` to return true if the input is an instance of either Car or Motorcycle (representing personal vehicles), false otherwise. The default case for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle returns false.","status":200,"tokens":[0,219],"elapsed":2.10957195,"_type":"aimessage"}]
