All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T === Car || T === Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T === Bus || T === Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function `ispersonal` checks the type of the input and returns a boolean value based on whether it's a subtype of `Car` or `Motorcycle` (which are considered personal vehicles), or a subtype of `Bus` or `Truck` (which are not). For any other subtypes, it defaults to returning false.\n\nHere is an example usage:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(AbstractVehicle)\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,305],"elapsed":2.899178543,"_type":"aimessage"}]
