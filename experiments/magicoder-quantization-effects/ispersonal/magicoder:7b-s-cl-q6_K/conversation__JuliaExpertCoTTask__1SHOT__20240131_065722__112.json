All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

We then define a function `ispersonal` that takes in a type parameter and returns whether or not it represents a personal vehicle.\n\nThe default case is handled by the last line of the function, which will return false for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.\n\nFor example:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(typealias AbstractVehicle2)\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[260,337],"elapsed":28.956242051,"_type":"aimessage"}]
