All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia solution that defines a `ispersonal` function which checks if a given vehicle type is personal or not:\n```julia\nabstract Vehicle <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: Vehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: Vehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: Vehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: Vehicle; end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:Vehicle} \n    if T <: Car || T <: Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T <: Bus || T <: Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function works by pattern matching on the provided type `T`. If `T` is a subtype of either `Car` or `Motorcycle`, it returns `true`, indicating that this vehicle is personal. If `T` is a subtype of either `Bus` or `Truck`, it returns `false`, indicating that this vehicle is not personal. For any other type, the function defaults to returning `false`.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Vehicle) # default case\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,342],"elapsed":3.287297859,"_type":"aimessage"}]
