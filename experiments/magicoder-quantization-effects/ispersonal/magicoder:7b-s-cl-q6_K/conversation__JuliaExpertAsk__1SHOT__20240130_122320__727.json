All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is a possible implementation using Julia programming language:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if vehicle isa Car || vehicle isa Motorcycle\n        return true  # For cars and motorcycles, it's a personal vehicle.\n    elseif vehicle isa Bus || vehicle isa Truck\n        return false  # For buses and trucks, it's not a personal vehicle.\n    else\n        return false  # Default value for other types of vehicles.\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this code, `ispersonal` function checks if the provided subtype of `AbstractVehicle` is either a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`, and returns true in such case. Otherwise it checks if the type is either a `Bus` or `Truck`, and returns false in such case. For any other type of vehicle, the function returns false by default.\n\nThis example can be used like:\n```julia\nvehicle = Car()\nprintln(ispersonal(vehicle))  # This will print true as car is a personal vehicle.\n\nbus = Bus()\nprintln(ispersonal(bus))  # This will print false as bus is not a personal vehicle.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,347],"elapsed":3.395013139,"_type":"aimessage"}]
