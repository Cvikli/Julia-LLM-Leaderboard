We also implement the function `ispersonal` to return a trait based on what kind of vehicle it is. If the vehicle is not one of the specific types, we default to returning false, signifying that it's not a personal vehicle for everyday driving.","status":200,"tokens":[0,220],"elapsed":2.115466903,"_type":"aimessage"}]
