All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(v::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T == Car || T == Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T == Bus || T == Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, we define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and four concrete types: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. The function `ispersonal(v::T)` checks the type of `v` and returns a boolean value based on whether it's a personal vehicle or not.\n\nFor example, if you call `ispersonal(Car())`, it will return true because cars are typically used for everyday driving. If you call `ispersonal(Bus())`, it will return false because buses are not usually used for daily commuting.","status":200,"tokens":[112,263],"elapsed":2.524518191,"_type":"aimessage"}]
