All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The function `ispersonal(vehicle::T)` checks the type of the provided vehicle. If it is either a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`, it returns true, if it's a `Bus` or `Truck`, it returns false. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, it defaults to returning false.\n\nTesting this function with an example:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,325],"elapsed":3.1288839,"_type":"aimessage"}]
