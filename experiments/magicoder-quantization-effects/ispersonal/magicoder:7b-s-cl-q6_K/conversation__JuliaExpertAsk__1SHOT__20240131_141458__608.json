All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T <: Car || T <: Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T <: Bus || T <: Truck\n        return false\n    else \n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\nThe function `ispersonal` checks if the provided type is a subtype of AbstractVehicle. If it is, the function checks if the type is either Car or Motorcycle (which are considered personal vehicles), returning true in such cases. If the type isn't either of these two types, but is a Bus or Truck instead, it returns false. For any other subtype of AbstractVehicle, it defaults to returning false as well.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\nispersonal(Car)  # true\nispersonal(Motorcycle)  # true\nispersonal(Bus)  # false\nispersonal(Truck)  # false\nispersonal(typealias Vehicle = AbstractVehicle end)  # false (default case)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,308],"elapsed":2.953686068,"_type":"aimessage"}]
