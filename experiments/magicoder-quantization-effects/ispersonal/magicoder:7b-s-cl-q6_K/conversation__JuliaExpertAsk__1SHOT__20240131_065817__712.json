All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia solution that defines `ispersonal` function:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Bus}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{Truck}) = false\n\nispersonal(::AbstractVehicle) = false  # default to false for other types\n```\nIn this solution, we define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and then four concrete subtypes: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, `Truck`. We then write functions that return true or false depending on the input type. For example, `ispersonal(::Type{Car})` will always return true because a car is typically used for personal purposes. Similarly, `ispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle})` returns true as well. However, `ispersonal(::Type{Bus})` and `ispersonal(::Type{Truck})` return false because buses and trucks are not typically used for daily driving. The last line of the function is a default case that will return false if the input type does not match any of the defined types.\n\nFor example, you can test this function with:\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car))  # prints true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle))  # prints true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus))  # prints false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck))  # prints false\nprintln(ispersonal(AbstractVehicle))  # prints false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,417],"elapsed":4.010524084,"_type":"aimessage"}]
