All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, it defaults to `false`.\n\nHere is an example usage:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(typeof(Car()))  # Note that we're passing an instance of Car to the function, not just the type.\ntrue\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,316],"elapsed":3.079606788,"_type":"aimessage"}]
