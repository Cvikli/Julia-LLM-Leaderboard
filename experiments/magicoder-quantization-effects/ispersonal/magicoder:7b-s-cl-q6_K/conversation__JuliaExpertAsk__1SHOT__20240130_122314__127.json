All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

This allows us to use the function `ispersonal` in a more robust and scalable manner. For example: \n\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)   # returns true\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)   # returns false\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck) # returns false\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle) # returns true\ntrue\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,304],"elapsed":2.918206886,"_type":"aimessage"}]
