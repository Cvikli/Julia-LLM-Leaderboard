All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia solution to your problem:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Bus}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{Truck}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{<:AbstractVehicle}) = false  # Default case for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle\n```\nYou can call this function with a type as argument to get the result. For example, `ispersonal(Car)` will return true and `ispersonal(Truck)` will return false.\n\nThis solution works by defining an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and then subtyping it into four concrete types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. Each of these types has a function associated with them in the ispersonal function to determine if they are personal vehicles or not. The default case for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle is set to return false.","status":200,"tokens":[0,280],"elapsed":2.685198319,"_type":"aimessage"}]
