The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

It then checks the type of the input and returns whether it's a personal vehicle or not. The default case (`v::AbstractVehicle`) returns false because by definition, all vehicles are not considered as personal vehicles for everyday driving.\n\nHere's how you could use this function:\n```julia\ncar = Car(\"red\")\nmotorcycle = Motorcycle(\"gasoline\")\nbus = Bus(50)\ntruck = Truck(2000.)\n\nprintln(ispersonal(car))  # Outputs: true\nprintln(ispersonal(motorcycle))  # Outputs: true\nprintln(ispersonal(bus))  # Outputs: false\nprintln(ispersonal(truck))  # Outputs: false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,375],"elapsed":3.592950874,"_type":"aimessage"}]
