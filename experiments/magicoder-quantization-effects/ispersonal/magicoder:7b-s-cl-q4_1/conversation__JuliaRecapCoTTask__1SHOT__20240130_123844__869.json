[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you could define a trait using an enum type:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end \nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end \nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end \nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true \nispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = true \nispersonal(::Type{Bus}) = false \nispersonal(::Type{Truck}) = false \n\nispersonal(v) = false\n```\nIn this example, `Car` and `Motorcycle` will return `true` when the function is called with them as arguments, while `Bus` and `Truck` will return `false`. For any other types that are subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`, we have defined the default behaviour to be `false`. The `ispersonal(v) = false` line handles any type of vehicle that is not one of the four specified earlier.\n\nIf you want this function to work with instances of these types, you can modify it slightly:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end \n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end \nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end \nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end \nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Car) = true \nispersonal(::Motorcycle) = true \nispersonal(::Bus) = false \nispersonal(::Truck) = false \n\nispersonal(v::AbstractVehicle) = false\n```\nIn this example, `Car` and `Motorcycle` will return `true` when called with an instance of them as arguments, while `Bus` and `Truck` will return `false`.
