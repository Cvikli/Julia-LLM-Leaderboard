All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you could define such a function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end \nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end \nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end \nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end \nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end \nstruct Vehicle <: AbstractVehicle; end # A general type for any other vehicle.\n\nfunction ispersonal(v::AbstractVehicle)\n    if v isa Car || v isa Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif v isa Bus || v isa Truck\n        return false\n    else \n        return false # Default value for any other type.\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this code, we define several types of vehicles as subtypes of AbstractVehicle using the `struct` keyword. The function `ispersonal` checks if a given instance of AbstractVehicle is an instance of Car or Motorcycle and returns true in that case, else it checks for Bus and Truck instances returning false in those cases. For any other type of Vehicle, it defaults to returning false.\n\nFor example, if we call `ispersonal(Car())` it will return true because a car is a personal vehicle, but calling `ispersonal(Truck())` will return false as trucks are not typically used for daily driving.","status":200,"tokens":[0,314],"elapsed":2.517276345,"_type":"aimessage"}]
