We then define four different types of vehicles: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus` and `Truck`. \n\nThe function `ispersonal` takes a generic argument `v::T` where `T` is any subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. It checks whether `T` is a subtype of either `Car` or `Motorcycle`, and returns true in such cases. If not, it checks if `T` is a subtype of `Bus` or `Truck`, returning false in those cases. Otherwise, the function returns false by default for any other type of vehicle.","status":200,"tokens":[0,344],"elapsed":2.790784543,"_type":"aimessage"}]
