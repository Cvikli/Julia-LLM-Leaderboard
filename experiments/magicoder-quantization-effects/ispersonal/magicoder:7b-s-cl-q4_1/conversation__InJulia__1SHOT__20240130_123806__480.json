All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation in Julia:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T <:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T == Car || T == Motorcycle \n        return true\n    elseif T == Bus || T == Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function uses Julia's subtyping feature to distinguish between different types of vehicles. `Car` and `Motorcycle` are personal vehicles, while `Bus` and `Truck` are not. The function returns a boolean value depending on the type provided.\n\nLet's test this:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n```\nIf you pass a type that isn't `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus` or `Truck`, the function defaults to false.","status":200,"tokens":[0,297],"elapsed":2.377028089,"_type":"aimessage"}]
