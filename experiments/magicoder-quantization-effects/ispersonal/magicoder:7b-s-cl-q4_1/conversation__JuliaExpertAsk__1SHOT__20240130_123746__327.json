All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia programming language, we can create a new type or subtypes by defining it as per our needs. Here's how you could implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end  # abstract base type for all vehicles\ntype Car <: AbstractVehicle end   # concrete subtype of AbstractVehicle\ntype Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\ntype Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\ntype Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\n# function that checks whether a vehicle is a personal vehicle or not.\nfunction ispersonal(v::AbstractVehicle) :: Bool\n    if v isa Car || v isa Motorcycle\n        return true  # it's a personal vehicle for everyday driving\n    elseif v isa Bus || v isa Truck\n        return false  # not a personal vehicle for everyday driving\n    end\nend\n\n# testing the function with different types\ncar = Car()\nmotorcycle = Motorcycle()\nbus = Bus()\ntruck = Truck()\n\nprintln(ispersonal(car))           # outputs: true\nprintln(ispersonal(motorcycle))    # outputs: true\nprintln(ispersonal(bus))          # outputs: false\nprintln(ispersonal(truck))        # outputs: false\n```\nIn this code, we first define a common abstract type `AbstractVehicle` for all vehicles. Then we define subtypes Car, Motorcycle, Bus and Truck that are concrete types (i.e., they cannot have further subtypes). The function `ispersonal()` checks if the passed object is an instance of one of our concrete subtypes, returning true in case it's a car or motorcycle, false otherwise.\nThe last part is testing the function with different objects, where we create instances of each type and print out their corresponding results from the function `ispersonal()`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,421],"elapsed":3.36862201,"_type":"aimessage"}]
