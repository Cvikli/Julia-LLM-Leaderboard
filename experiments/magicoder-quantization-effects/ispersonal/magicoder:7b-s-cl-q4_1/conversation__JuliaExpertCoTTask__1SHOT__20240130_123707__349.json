However, `Bus` and `Truck` are also instances of `AbstractVehicle`, but these types should not be considered personal vehicles so they return false. The final line is a default case where any other subtype of AbstractVehicle returns false.","status":200,"tokens":[0,214],"elapsed":1.724219431,"_type":"aimessage"}]
