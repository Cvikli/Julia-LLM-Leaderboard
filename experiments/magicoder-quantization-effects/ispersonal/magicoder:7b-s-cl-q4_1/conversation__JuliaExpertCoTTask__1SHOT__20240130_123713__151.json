All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

These subtypes are `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`.\n\nThe function `ispersonal(::Type{T})` returns true if the input type `T` corresponds to a personal vehicle, and false otherwise. For subtypes of `AbstractVehicle` that correspond to personal vehicles (`Car` and `Motorcycle`), it returns true. For types corresponding to non-personal vehicles (`Bus` and `Truck`), it returns false.\n\nThe function is tested with an example usage of `ispersonal(Car)`, which should output `true`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,322],"elapsed":2.596302643,"_type":"aimessage"}]
