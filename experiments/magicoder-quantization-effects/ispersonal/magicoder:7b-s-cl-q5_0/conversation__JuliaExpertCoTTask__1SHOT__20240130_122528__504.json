All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

We then use multiple dispatch to make functions that will return different results for each of these subtypes. The function `ispersonal` checks if the input is an instance of any of the defined types and returns a boolean based on whether it's a Car or Motorcycle, or not for Bus and Truck. If the input type does not match one of the defined types then it defaults to returning false.\n\nWe then test our function with an example which should return true since Car and Motorcycle are personal vehicles for everyday driving.","status":200,"tokens":[0,302],"elapsed":2.567598826,"_type":"aimessage"}]
