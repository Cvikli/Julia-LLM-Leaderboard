All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

For any other type, the function defaults to returning false.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car())) # Outputs: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle())) # Outputs: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus())) # Outputs: false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck())) # Outputs: false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,277],"elapsed":2.347057876,"_type":"aimessage"}]
