All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple solution written in Julia programming language:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Car) = true \nispersonal(::Motorcycle) = true \nispersonal(::Bus) = false \nispersonal(::Truck) = false \n\nispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle) = false\n```\n\nThis code defines an abstract type `AbstractVehicle`, and four concrete types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck which are all subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Then, there are five function definitions: one for each vehicle type. The first two functions return true if the Vehicle is a Car or Motorcycle, while the latter two return false if the Vehicle is a Bus or Truck.\n\nFinally, there's a single-argument function `ispersonal` that returns false by default for any AbstractVehicle not matched by one of the previous functions. \n\nAs an example, you can call the function like this:\n\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car())) # Output: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus()))  # Output: false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck()))  # Output: false\nprintln(ispersonal(AbstractVehicle()))  # Output: false\n```\nThese calls will print out the results of calling `ispersonal` on instances of each type.","status":200,"tokens":[0,368],"elapsed":3.129894235,"_type":"aimessage"}]
