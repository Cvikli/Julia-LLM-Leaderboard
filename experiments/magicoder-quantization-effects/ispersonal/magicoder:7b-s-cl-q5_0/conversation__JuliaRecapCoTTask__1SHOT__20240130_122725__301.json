[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving.

Then we define four concrete types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, and Truck. Each of these types is a subtype of the abstract type. \n\nNext, we implement our function `ispersonal()`. This function takes in a type (T), which must be a subtype of AbstractVehicle, and returns whether it's a personal vehicle or not. The `::Type{T} where {T<:AbstractVehicle}` syntax means that this function is generic over the type T, and we can call it with any subtype of AbstractVehicle.\n\nIf the type T is either Car or Motorcycle, the function returns true (since these are personal vehicles), if it's Bus or Truck, it returns false (since these aren't). For all other types of AbstractVehicle, it defaults to returning false.\n\nYou can use this function like so: \n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Wagon) # Wagon is not a subtype of AbstractVehicle\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,451],"elapsed":3.955054582,"_type":"aimessage"}]
