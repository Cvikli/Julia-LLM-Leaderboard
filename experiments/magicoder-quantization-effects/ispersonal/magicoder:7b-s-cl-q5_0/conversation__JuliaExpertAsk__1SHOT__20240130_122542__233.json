All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is a simple solution in Julia that defines a supertype `AbstractVehicle` and four subtypes `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, `Truck`. Each subtype has a method `ispersonal` which checks if the vehicle type is personal or not. \n\n```julia\nabstract AbstractVehicle\ntype Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\ntype Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\ntype Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\ntype Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    false\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::Union{Car, Motorcycle})\n    true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::Union{Bus, Truck})\n    false\nend\n```\n\nIn the above code: \n- `AbstractVehicle` is an abstract type (supertype) which has no concrete instances. This type serves as a common denominator for all other types.\n- `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck` are subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`. These types have methods defined in the `ispersonal` function (for each specific subtype). \n\nFor example:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,355],"elapsed":3.000004408,"_type":"aimessage"}]
