All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia programming language you could define your function as follows:\n```julia\nabstract Vehicle end\ntype Car <: Vehicle end\ntype Motorcycle <: Vehicle end\ntype Bus <: Vehicle end\ntype Truck <: Vehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Car) = true\nfunction ispersonal(::Motorcycle) = true\nfunction ispersonal(::Bus) = false\nfunction ispersonal(::Truck) = false\n\nispersonal(v::Vehicle) = false  # for any other subtype of Vehicle, default to false\n```\nIn this code snippet, `abstract Vehicle end` defines the supertype and `type Car <: Vehicle end`, `type Motorcycle <: Vehicle end`, etc. define its subtypes. The function `ispersonal(::Car) = true` , `ispersonal(::Motorcycle) = true`, etc., specify that these subtypes return `true`. For the subtypes Bus and Truck, we have `function ispersonal(::Bus) = false` and `function ispersonal(::Truck) = false` respectively. For any other subtype of Vehicle (that was not specified explicitly), we set default trait to `false` with `ispersonal(v::Vehicle) = false`.\n\nExample:\n```julia\ncar = Car()\nbus = Bus()\nmotorcycle = Motorcycle()\ntruck = Truck()\n\nprintln(ispersonal(car))  # prints: true\nprintln(ispersonal(bus))  # prints: false\nprintln(ispersonal(motorcycle))  # prints: true\nprintln(ispersonal(truck))  # prints: false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,401],"elapsed":3.392423679,"_type":"aimessage"}]
