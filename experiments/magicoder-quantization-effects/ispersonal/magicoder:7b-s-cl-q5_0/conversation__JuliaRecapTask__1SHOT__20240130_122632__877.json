[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving.

Then the function `ispersonal(vehicle::T)` is defined using multiple dispatch (i.e., it works with different types `T`). \n\nIf `T` is either a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`, the function returns true; if `T` is either a `Bus` or a `Truck`, it returns false. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, it also returns false.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\ncar = Car(true)\nmotorcycle = Motorcycle(false)\nbus = Bus(50)\ntruck = Truck(123456789.0)\n\nprintln(ispersonal(car)) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(motorcycle)) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(bus)) # false\nprintln(ispersonal(truck)) # false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[412,421],"elapsed":3.712783031,"_type":"aimessage"}]
