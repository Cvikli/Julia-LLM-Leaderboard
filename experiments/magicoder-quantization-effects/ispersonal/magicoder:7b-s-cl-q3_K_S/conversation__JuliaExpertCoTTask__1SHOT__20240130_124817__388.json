All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

For each type of vehicle (Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck), we create a corresponding struct and make them instances of their respective supertype.\nThen we have the function ispersonal which checks if the provided Vehicle type is either Car or Motorcycle by using the `typeof` function to get the Type object representing these types. If it is not any of those, it returns false for CommercialVehicle and true for PersonalVehicle subtypes as requested. This example does not use any Data, but you can provide some in your task description if needed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,360],"elapsed":2.852685153,"_type":"aimessage"}]
