All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can define a method for each specific type using methods with multiple dispatch. Here is how you could implement the function `ispersonal`:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle <: Vehicle end  # Define abstract supertype\nabstract type Car <: AbstractVehicle end       # Define an abstract subtype\nabstract type Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nabstract type Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nabstract type Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Car) = true  # Method for Car\nispersonal(::Motorcycle) = true  # Method for Motorcycle\nispersonal(::Bus) = false  # Method for Bus\nispersonal(::Truck) = false  # Method for Truck\n\n# Example usage:\ncar = Car()  # Create an instance of the Car subtype\nprintln(ispersonal(car))  # Output: true\n```\nIn this code, `Vehicle` and its subtypes are abstract types. The function `ispersonal` returns a boolean value depending on whether it is called with an instance of a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`, or not if the argument's type is unknown. \n\nFor the remaining vehicle types (Bus, Truck), the function defaults to returning false.","status":200,"tokens":[260,297],"elapsed":3.541541594,"_type":"aimessage"}]
