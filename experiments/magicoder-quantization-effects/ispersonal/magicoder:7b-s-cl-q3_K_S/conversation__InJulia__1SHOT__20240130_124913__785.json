All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible solution in Julia:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end  # define abstract vehicle supertype\n\n# Define the different types of vehicles\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\n# function to check personal use (true or false) for each vehicle type \nfunction ispersonal(::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle} = false   # Default return false, overwritten for Car and Motorcycle\nispersonal(::Car) = true                                     # Return true if the input is a car\nispersonal(::Motorcycle) = true                               # Return true if the input is a motorcycle\n```\nThis function returns whether each vehicle subtype is suitable for everyday driving. The Car and Motorcycle types return `true`, while Bus and Truck return `false`. For any other subtype, it defaults to returning false.\nHere's an example of how you might use this function:\n```julia\ncar = Car()\nmotorcycle = Motorcycle()\nbus = Bus()\ntruck = Truck()\nnonvehicle = AbstractVehicle()  # Non-vehicle type to demonstrate default behavior\n\nfor v in (car, motorcycle, bus, truck, nonvehicle)\n    trait = ispersonal(v) ? \"This vehicle is suitable for everyday driving\" : \"This vehicle is not suitable for everyday driving\" \n    @printf \"%s\\n\", trait\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,364],"elapsed":2.842932438,"_type":"aimessage"}]
