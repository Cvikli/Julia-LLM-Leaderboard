The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The `ispersonal` field in each vehicle is a boolean that specifies if the vehicle is personal for everyday driving. \n\nThen, we test this function with an example. For the `car`, `motorcycle`, and `truck`, it returns `true` and `false`, respectively. The `bus` returns `false`. This means our function works as expected for the given subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,430],"elapsed":3.389415148,"_type":"aimessage"}]
