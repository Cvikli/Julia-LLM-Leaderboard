When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you would define a function like this:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end \nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nispersonal(::Car) = true\nispersonal(::Motorcycle) = true\nispersonal(::Bus) = false\nispersonal(::Truck) = false\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle) \n    return false\nend\n```\nThis function uses multiple dispatch in Julia. It defines several subtypes of AbstractVehicle (Car, Motorcycle, Bus, and Truck), each with its own implementation for the `ispersonal` method. When called on an instance of a specific subtype, this method returns `true` or `false` as appropriate. If you call it on an instance of any other subtype, it falls back to returning `false`, because there's no specific implementation for that subtype.","status":200,"tokens":[0,246],"elapsed":1.989866319,"_type":"aimessage"}]
