All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Car and Motorcycle inherit from `PersonalVehicle`, while Bus and Truck inherit from `NonPersonalVehicle`.\n\nThe function `ispersonal` returns true for any subtype of `PersonalVehicle` (Car, Motorcycle) and false otherwise, which corresponds to the trait we are interested in. If a type does not belong to either `PersonalVehicle` or `NonPersonalVehicle`, it defaults to false as per our requirement.","status":200,"tokens":[0,386],"elapsed":3.112062491,"_type":"aimessage"}]
