All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Car) = true\nispersonal(::Motorcycle) = true\nispersonal(::Bus) = false\nispersonal(::Truck) = false\nispersonal(::AbstractVehicle) = false  # Default case\n```\nIn the above code, we define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and then four specific types of vehicles: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. We then define a function `ispersonal(::Type{T}) where T <: AbstractVehicle` for each vehicle type, returning true or false as per the problem statement. The default case is handled by `ispersonal(::AbstractVehicle) = false`.\n\nNow you can test this function with an example:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(AbstractVehicle)  # Default case\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,334],"elapsed":2.676385343,"_type":"aimessage"}]
