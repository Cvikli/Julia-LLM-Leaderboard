Each of these types is a subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. We then define the function `ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T <: AbstractVehicle}` to return whether or not each type is a personal vehicle. The function uses pattern matching to determine the type and returns the appropriate boolean value.","status":200,"tokens":[0,304],"elapsed":2.43043162,"_type":"aimessage"}]
