We then define a function `ispersonal` that takes in one argument of any subtype of `AbstractVehicle` and returns a boolean value. The function is defined to return true for Motorcycles, Buses, and Trucks, and false for all other types of vehicles. If the vehicle type does not match any of these four cases, it defaults to returning false.","status":200,"tokens":[260,269],"elapsed":6.836247323,"_type":"aimessage"}]
