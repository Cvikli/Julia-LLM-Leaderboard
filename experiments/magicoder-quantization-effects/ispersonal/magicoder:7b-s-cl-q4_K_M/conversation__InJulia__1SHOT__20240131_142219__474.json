We define a `ispersonal` function that checks if the provided vehicle type is a personal vehicle or not, and returns true or false accordingly:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\ntype Car <: AbstractVehicle end\ntype Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\ntype Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\ntype Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(v::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T == Car || T == Motorcycle  # If the vehicle type is a car or motorcycle, return true\n        return true\n    elseif T == Bus || T == Truck   # If the vehicle type is a bus or truck, return false\n        return false\n    end\n    return false                      # Default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, `ispersonal` function checks if the provided argument belongs to the types Car and Motorcycle (which are personal vehicles) or Bus and Truck (which are not personal vehicles). If it is a personal vehicle type, it returns true. If it is a non-personal vehicle type, it returns false. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, it defaults to returning false as well.\n\nYou can test the function with an example like this:\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car()))  # This should return true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus()))  # This should return false\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle()))  # This should return true\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck()))  # This should return false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,378],"elapsed":3.020979738,"_type":"aimessage"}]
