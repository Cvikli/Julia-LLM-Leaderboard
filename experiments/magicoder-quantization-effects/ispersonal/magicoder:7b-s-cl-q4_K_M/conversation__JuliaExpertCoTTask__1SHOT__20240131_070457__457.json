We then define the function `ispersonal(::Type{T}) where T <: AbstractVehicle` for each of these types. This function returns a trait (in this case, just a boolean) based on whether or not the provided vehicle type is a personal vehicle. The default case is handled by returning false for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.\n\nThe example `ispersonal(Car())` will return true because a car is a personal vehicle.","status":200,"tokens":[0,304],"elapsed":2.442452444,"_type":"aimessage"}]
