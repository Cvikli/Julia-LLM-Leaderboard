All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation in Julia:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T == Car || T == Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T == Bus || T == Truck\n        return false\n    else \n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\nIn the above code, we first define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` which is the parent of all vehicle types. Then we define four subtypes: Car, Motorcycle, Bus and Truck. The function `ispersonal(vehicle::T)` is a generic function that takes in a parameter of any specific type that is a subtype of AbstractVehicle.\n\nWe then use conditional logic to check if the provided vehicle type (`T`) is either a Car or Motorcycle (which are considered personal vehicles), in which case we return `true`. If it's a Bus or Truck, we return `false` as these types of vehicles are not considered personal for everyday driving. For any other subtype of AbstractVehicle, we default to returning `false`.\n\nHere is an example usage:\n```julia\njulia> Car() |> ispersonal\ntrue\n\njulia> Motorcycle() |> ispersonal\ntrue\n\njulia> Bus() |> ispersonal\nfalse\n\njulia> Truck() |> ispersonal\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,377],"elapsed":3.01286415,"_type":"aimessage"}]
