All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

We then define a function `ispersonal` that returns true for instances of `Car` and `Motorcycle`, and false for instances of `Bus` and `Truck. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, the function defaults to returning false.\n\nThe last line is an example usage of the function, which prints out whether a `Car` instance is considered a personal vehicle or not (which should be true).","status":200,"tokens":[0,283],"elapsed":2.278052865,"_type":"aimessage"}]
