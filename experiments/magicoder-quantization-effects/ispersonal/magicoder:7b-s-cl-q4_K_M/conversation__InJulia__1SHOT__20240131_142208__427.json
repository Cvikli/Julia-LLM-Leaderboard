For the other types (bus and truck), it returns `false`. If the input does not match with any type, it defaults to `false`.\n\nYou can test this function using an example:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bicycle()) # returns false, as Bicycle is not a subtype of AbstractVehicle\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,318],"elapsed":2.532031578,"_type":"aimessage"}]
