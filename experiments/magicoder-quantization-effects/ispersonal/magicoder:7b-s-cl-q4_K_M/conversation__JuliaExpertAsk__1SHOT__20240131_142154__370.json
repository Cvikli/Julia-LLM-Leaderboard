All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

We also define a function `ispersonal` that takes one argument and returns true if it is of type `Car` or `Motorcycle`, false otherwise.\n\nThe default case for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle` is set to return false using the generic method definition at the end of the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,319],"elapsed":2.55042899,"_type":"aimessage"}]
