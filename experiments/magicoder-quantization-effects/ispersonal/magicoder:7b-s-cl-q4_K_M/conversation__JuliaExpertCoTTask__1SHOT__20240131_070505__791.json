All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

If the type is either `Car` or `Motorcycle`, it returns true, meaning that these types are personal vehicles for everyday driving. For types `Bus` and `Truck`, it returns false, as they are not used for daily commuting. For any other subtype of AbstractVehicle, it defaults to returning false. \n\nFor example:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(AbstractVehicle)  # This will return false, as AbstractVehicle is not a specific type of vehicle.\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,348],"elapsed":2.784594976,"_type":"aimessage"}]
