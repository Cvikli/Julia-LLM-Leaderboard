[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Define the `ispersonal` function as follows:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nabstract type Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nabstract type Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nabstract type Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nabstract type Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Car) = true\nispersonal(::Motorcycle) = true\nispersonal(::Bus) = false\nispersonal(::Truck) = false\nispersonal(x::AbstractVehicle) = false  # Default case for other subtypes of AbstractVehicle\n```\nIn this solution, each subtype of `AbstractVehicle` is associated with a specific value that indicates whether it's considered a personal vehicle. The `ispersonal` function will return the trait for any provided type if there's an explicit method defined; otherwise, it defaults to returning false.\n\nHere is an example usage:\n```julia\njulia> Vehicle = Bus  # Replace with your preferred type\nBus\n\njulia> ispersonal(Vehicle)\nfalse\n```\nThis demonstrates that the Bus subtype of AbstractVehicle, which was defined as `ispersonal(::Bus) = false`, returns false when passed to the `ispersonal` function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,316],"elapsed":2.586098027,"_type":"aimessage"}]
