All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you could define the `ispersonal` function like this:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nabstract type Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nabstract type Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nabstract type Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nabstract type Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Bus}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{Truck}) = false\n\nispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle) = ispersonal(typeof(vehicle))\n```\nIn the above code, we first define a set of abstract types. Then, for each type that represents a personal vehicle (Car and Motorcycle), we define a function `ispersonal` which returns true. For non-personal vehicles (Bus and Truck), we return false.\n\nThe `ispersonal(::Type{...})` functions are the trait implementations for specific types. The last line allows us to call this function on any object of type AbstractVehicle, even though it doesn't have an implementation for that function itself. \n\nExample usage:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car()) # true\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck()) # false\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle()) # true\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus()) # false\n\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,346],"elapsed":2.806232105,"_type":"aimessage"}]
