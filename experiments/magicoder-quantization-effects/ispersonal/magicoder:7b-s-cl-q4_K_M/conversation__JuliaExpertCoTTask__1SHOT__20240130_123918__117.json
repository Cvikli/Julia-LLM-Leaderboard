Then we have specific types `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. The function `ispersonal(::Car)` returns true, meaning a car is suitable for everyday driving. The same applies to motorcycles and buses. A truck, on the other hand, is not typically used for daily commuting so it's defined as false. If we call this function with an object of any other type that is not a `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, or `Truck`, the function defaults to returning false.\nFinally, we test our function by creating instances of each vehicle and then calling the `ispersonal` function on those objects. The results should be as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[0,424],"elapsed":3.424833785,"_type":"aimessage"}]
