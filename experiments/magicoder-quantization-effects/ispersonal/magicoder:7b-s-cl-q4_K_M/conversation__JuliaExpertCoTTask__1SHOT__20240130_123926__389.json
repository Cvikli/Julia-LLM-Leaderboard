All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The function `ispersonal` checks if the provided Vehicle is a personal vehicle for everyday driving by returning true if the vehicle is either a Car or a Motorcycle, otherwise it returns false. For any other type of AbstractVehicle (i.e., Bus and Truck), the default value of false is returned. The function `ispersonal` handles all possible subtypes of `AbstractVehicle` accurately.\n\nTesting this function with a Car should return true, while testing it on a Truck should return false:\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car()))  # returns: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck()))  # returns: false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,324],"elapsed":2.625168731,"_type":"aimessage"}]
