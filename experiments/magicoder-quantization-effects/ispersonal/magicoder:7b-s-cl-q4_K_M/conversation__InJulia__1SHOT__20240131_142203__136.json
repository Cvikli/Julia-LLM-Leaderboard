All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

For the types Car and Motorcycle, it returns true indicating they are suitable for everyday driving. On the contrary, the Bus and Truck types return false indicating that they aren't suitable for daily commuting. The default case for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle is also defined to return false.\n\nYou can test this function with an example:\n```julia\njulia> vehicle = Car()\nCar\n\njulia> ispersonal(vehicle)\ntrue\n\njulia> vehicle = Motorcycle()\nMotorcycle\n\njulia> ispersonal(vehicle)\ntrue\n\njulia> vehicle = Bus()\nBus\n\njulia> ispersonal(vehicle)\nfalse\n\njulia> vehicle = Truck()\nTruck\n\njulia> ispersonal(vehicle)\nfalse\n\njulia> vehicle = Vehicle()  # Assuming Vehicle to be a subtype of AbstractVehicle not defined in the code above\nVehicle\n\njulia> ispersonal(vehicle)\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,464],"elapsed":3.729425053,"_type":"aimessage"}]
