All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia programming language, you can define a function as follows:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(v::AbstractVehicle) \n    if v isa Car || v isa Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif v isa Bus || v isa Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function `ispersonal` checks the type of input and returns a boolean value. If the provided vehicle is either a Car or Motorcycle, it returns true. For other types like Bus and Truck, it returns false. The default case for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle is also handled by returning false.\n\nFor example, calling `ispersonal(Car())` will return `true`, while calling `ispersonal(Truck())` will return `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,237],"elapsed":1.899682661,"_type":"aimessage"}]
