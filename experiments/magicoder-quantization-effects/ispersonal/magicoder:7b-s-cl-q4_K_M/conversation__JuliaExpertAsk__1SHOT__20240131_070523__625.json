All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T == Car || T == Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T == Bus || T == Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function `ispersonal` takes a type as input and returns whether it is a personal vehicle or not. It uses the `where` keyword to specify that the input must be a subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. If the type matches `Car` or `Motorcycle`, the function returns `true` indicating it's a personal vehicle. For types `Bus` and `Truck`, the function returns `false` as they are not used for everyday driving. Any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle` will return `false`.\n\nFor example, if you call `ispersonal(Car)`, it would return `true` because a car is a personal vehicle. If you call `ispersonal(Truck)`, it would return `false` because a truck is not used for everyday driving.","status":200,"tokens":[0,314],"elapsed":2.501042382,"_type":"aimessage"}]
