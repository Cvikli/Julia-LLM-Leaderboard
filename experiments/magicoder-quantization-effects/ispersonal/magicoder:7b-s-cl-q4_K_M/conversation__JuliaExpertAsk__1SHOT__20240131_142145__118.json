The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia solution for your problem. We define `ispersonal` trait as a new type and then we implement it using a dispatch mechanism:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Car) = true\nispersonal(::Motorcycle) = true\nispersonal(::Bus) = false\nispersonal(::Truck) = false\n\n# Default case for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle\nispersonal(v::AbstractVehicle) = false\n```\n\nThis function will return `true` if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle (Car or Motorcycle), and `false` otherwise. For example:\n\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(AbstractVehicle)  # Default case for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,298],"elapsed":2.378753215,"_type":"aimessage"}]
