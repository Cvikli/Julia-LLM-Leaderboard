It does this by checking the type of the input and returning true or false accordingly. If the input is not a subtype of AbstractVehicle, it defaults to calling itself with the concrete type of the input.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(AbstractVehicle)\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,313],"elapsed":2.497401997,"_type":"aimessage"}]
