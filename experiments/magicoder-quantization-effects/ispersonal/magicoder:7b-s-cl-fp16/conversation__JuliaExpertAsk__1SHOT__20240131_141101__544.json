All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia program that defines a `ispersonal` function:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end  # abstract supertype\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end   # concrete subtype\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end    # another concrete subtype\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end     # yet another concrete subtype\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end  # one more concrete subtype\n\nispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true   # define the trait for Car and Motorcycle\nispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Bus}) = false    # define the trait for Bus and Truck\nispersonal(::Type{Truck}) = false\n\n# test the function with an example type\nprintln(ispersonal(Car))  # should print: true\n```\n\nIn this program, `AbstractVehicle` is an abstract supertype which means it cannot be instantiated. It serves as a common supertype for all other vehicle types in our program. The concrete subtypes `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck` are defined each with their own traits.\nThe `ispersonal` function takes a type as an argument, and returns the trait (boolean value) of that particular type. \n\nFor example, when called with `Car`, it will return true because cars are personal vehicles for everyday driving. The same applies to `Motorcycle`. However, for `Bus` and `Truck`, which represent non-personal vehicles, the function returns false.","status":200,"tokens":[0,366],"elapsed":6.353922529,"_type":"aimessage"}]
