We then define a function `ispersonal(vehicle::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}` that takes a vehicle as input. If the type of the vehicle is either `Car` or `Motorcycle`, it returns true, meaning this is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. If the type of the vehicle is either `Bus` or `Truck`, it returns false, meaning this is not a personal vehicle for everyday driving. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, it defaults to returning false.\n\nFor example, calling `ispersonal(Car())` would return true because a `Car` is indeed a personal vehicle for everyday driving.","status":200,"tokens":[0,323],"elapsed":5.590025306,"_type":"aimessage"}]
