It's just an abstract type without concrete instances.\nfalse\n```\n\nThis function checks the type of the provided vehicle and returns true if it's either a car or motorcycle (which are considered personal vehicles for everyday driving), and false otherwise. If you pass in a different subtype of AbstractVehicle, like `AbstractVehicle`, then it will return false because this is not a Car, Motorcycle, Bus or Truck type.","status":200,"tokens":[0,370],"elapsed":6.44108048,"_type":"aimessage"}]
