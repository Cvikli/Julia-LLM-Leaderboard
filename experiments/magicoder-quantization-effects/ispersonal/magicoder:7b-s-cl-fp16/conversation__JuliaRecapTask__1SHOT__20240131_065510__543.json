[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving.

The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

We then define a function `ispersonal` for each of these types that returns true if the vehicle is personal (i.e., it's a car or motorcycle) and false otherwise. \n\nThe function `ispersonal(::Type{vehicle_type})` is defined to handle any type that isn't one of the four concrete types we defined earlier. This function will default to returning false for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\njulia> vehicle = Car()\nCar()\n\njulia> ispersonal(vehicle)\ntrue\n\njulia> vehicle = Motorcycle()\nMotorcycle()\n\njulia> ispersonal(vehicle)\ntrue\n\njulia> vehicle = Bus()\nBus()\n\njulia> ispersonal(vehicle)\nfalse\n\njulia> vehicle = Truck()\nTruck()\n\njulia> ispersonal(vehicle)\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,424],"elapsed":7.428586595,"_type":"aimessage"}]
