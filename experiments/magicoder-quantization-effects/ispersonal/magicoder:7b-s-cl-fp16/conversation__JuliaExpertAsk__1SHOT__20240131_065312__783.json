All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia program that defines the `ispersonal` function according to your specifications:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T == Car || T == Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T == Bus || T == Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\n\nYou can test the function with an example like this:\n\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car))  # Outputs: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle))  # Outputs: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus))  # Outputs: false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck))  # Outputs: false\n```\n\nIn this example, `ispersonal` returns `true` for the types `Car` and `Motorcycle`, and `false` for the types `Bus` and `Truck`. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, it defaults to returning `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,292],"elapsed":5.050914555,"_type":"aimessage"}]
