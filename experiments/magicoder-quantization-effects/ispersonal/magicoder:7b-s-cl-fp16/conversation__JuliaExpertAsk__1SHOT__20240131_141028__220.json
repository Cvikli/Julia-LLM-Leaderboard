All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T == Car || T == Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T == Bus || T == Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function uses type parametric dispatch to determine whether a given vehicle is personal or not. The `ispersonal` function will return `true` if the provided `vehicle` is an instance of either `Car` or `Motorcycle`, and `false` otherwise. For `Bus` and `Truck`, it will always return `false`. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, it defaults to `false`.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\nispersonal(Car()) # true\nispersonal(Motorcycle()) # true\nispersonal(Bus()) # false\nispersonal(Truck()) # false\nispersonal(SubtypeOfAbstractVehicle()) # false (assuming SubtypeOfAbstractVehicle is a subtype of AbstractVehicle)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,319],"elapsed":5.532738992,"_type":"aimessage"}]
