[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

It uses parametric polymorphism (generics) to ensure that it works correctly with all subtypes of AbstractVehicle. We have also defined a default behaviour for any other type of vehicle, returning false.\n\nFor example:\n```julia\nc = Car(true)  # This is a personal car\nm = Motorcycle(true)  # This is a motorcycle with rider\nb = Bus()   # This is a bus - not suitable for daily driving\nt = Truck()  # This is a truck - not suitable for daily driving\nprintln(ispersonal(c))  # Should print true\nprintln(ispersonal(m))  # Should print true\nprintln(ispersonal(b))  # Should print false\nprintln(ispersonal(t))  # Should print false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,401],"elapsed":7.097812374,"_type":"aimessage"}]
