All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if vehicle isa Car || vehicle isa Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif vehicle isa Bus || vehicle isa Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this example, the `ispersonal` function checks whether a given `vehicle` is an instance of either `Car` or `Motorcycle`, returning `true`. If it's not one of these types, but is instead an instance of either `Bus` or `Truck`, the function returns `false`. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, the function defaults to returning `false`.\n\nYou can test this with:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(AbstractVehicle())  # Default case\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,324],"elapsed":5.632353783,"_type":"aimessage"}]
