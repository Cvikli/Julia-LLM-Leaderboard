All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia solution:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end \nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end  \nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end  \nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end  \n\nispersonal(::Car) = true\nispersonal(::Motorcycle) = true\nispersonal(::Bus) = false\nispersonal(::Truck) = false\n\nispersonal() = false  # Default case\n```\nIn the code above, we define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and four concrete types `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. Then, we specify that `ispersonal()` function should return true for `Car` and `Motorcycle` instances (i.e., personal vehicles), false for `Bus` and `Truck` instances (i.e., non-personal vehicles), and false as the default case for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.\n\nThe function `ispersonal()` is defined with three dots `::` to specify that it's a method for a type, not a specific instance. \n\nHere's an example of how you could use this function:\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car()))    # Output: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle()))   # Output: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus()))   # Output: false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck()))  # Output: false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,359],"elapsed":6.337599368,"_type":"aimessage"}]
