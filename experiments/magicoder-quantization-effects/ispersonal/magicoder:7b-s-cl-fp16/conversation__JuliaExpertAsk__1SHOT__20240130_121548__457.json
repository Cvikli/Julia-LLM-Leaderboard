All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia program that defines this `ispersonal` function:\n```julia\nabstract Vehicle <: AbstractVehicle end\nabstract Car <: Vehicle end; const iscar::Bool = true\nabstract Motorcycle <: Vehicle end; const ismotorcycle::Bool = true\nabstract Bus <: Vehicle end; const isbus::Bool = false\nabstract Truck <: Vehicle end; const istruck::Bool = false\n\nfunction ispersonal(v::T) where {T<:Vehicle}\n    if T == Car || T == Motorcycle\n        return iscar\n    elseif T == Bus || T == Truck\n        return istrack\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\nHere, the function `ispersonal` returns a trait based on whether the provided Vehicle type is a Car or a Motorcycle (which are considered personal vehicles). For types Bus and Truck, it returns the respective Boolean value that has been stored for these vehicle types. If the Vehicle type does not match any of the predefined types, it returns false. The `const` keyword is used to store Boolean values for each vehicle type so they can be directly accessed without creating an instance of the corresponding type.\n\nHere's a brief example:\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car)) # Outputs: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle)) # Outputs: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus)) # Outputs: false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck)) # Outputs: false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,356],"elapsed":6.330410127,"_type":"aimessage"}]
