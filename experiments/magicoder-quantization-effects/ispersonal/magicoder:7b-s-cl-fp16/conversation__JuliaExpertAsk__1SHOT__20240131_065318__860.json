All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia solution for your problem:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T == Car || T == Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T == Bus || T == Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, we define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and four concrete types: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. Then, we implement the function `ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}`. This function takes a type `T` as input and checks if it is either `Car` or `Motorcycle` (in which case it returns true), or `Bus` or `Truck` (in which case it returns false). If the input type does not match any of these, it defaults to returning false.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(AbstractVehicle) # Returns false because AbstractVehicle is not a concrete type.\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,378],"elapsed":6.555823759,"_type":"aimessage"}]
