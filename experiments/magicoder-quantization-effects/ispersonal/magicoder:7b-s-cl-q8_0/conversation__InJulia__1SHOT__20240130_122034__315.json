All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem in Julia by using a simple conditional check within your function. Here is how you might implement `ispersonal` function:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end \nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end \nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end \nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end \n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T == Car || T == Motorcycle   # checking the type of the vehicle \n        return true  # it's a personal vehicle for everyday driving\n    elseif T == Bus || T == Truck\n        return false  # not a personal vehicle for everyday driving\n    end\n    \n    return false  # default value if the type is not Car, Motorcycle, Bus or Truck\nend\n```\n\nNow you can use your `ispersonal` function to check whether each of the subtypes are personal vehicles:\n\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car()))   # prints true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle()))  # prints true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus()))    # prints false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck()))  # prints false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[112,296],"elapsed":3.403053063,"_type":"aimessage"}]
