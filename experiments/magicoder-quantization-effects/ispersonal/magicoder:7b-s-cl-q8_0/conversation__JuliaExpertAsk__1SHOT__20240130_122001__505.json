All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can define this function in Julia programming language:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Car})\n    return true \nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle})\n    return true \nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Truck})\n    return false \nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Bus})\n    return false \nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::AbstractVehicle)\n    return false\nend\n```\nIn this code, we define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and four concrete types `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Truck`, `Bus`. Each of these types has a function `ispersonal(::Type{<type>})` that returns a boolean value. The default case is when you pass any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, in which case the function should return `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,262],"elapsed":2.937322803,"_type":"aimessage"}]
