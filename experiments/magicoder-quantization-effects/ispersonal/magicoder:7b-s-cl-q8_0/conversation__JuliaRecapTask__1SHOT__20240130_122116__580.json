[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving.

We can use the `@inline` macro to ensure the function does not incur any overhead during runtime:\n\n```julia\n# AbstractVehicle and its concrete types\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\n# The trait function `ispersonal`\n@inline function ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    return T <: (Car || Motorcycle)\nend\n```\n\nFor example, calling the `ispersonal` function with types `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck` will return `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle` and `false` for `Bus` and `Truck`. \n\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car) # true\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle) # true\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus) # false\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck) # false\n``` \n\nThis function can be further extended to include more types of vehicles by adding more conditions within the `@inline` function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,330],"elapsed":3.808199706,"_type":"aimessage"}]
