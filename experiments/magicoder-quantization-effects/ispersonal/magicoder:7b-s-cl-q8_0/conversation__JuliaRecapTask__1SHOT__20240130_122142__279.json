[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving.

The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The function `ispersonal(::Type{X})` defines the trait for each vehicle type. For `Car` and `Motorcycle`, it returns true which means they can be used for personal purposes, while for `Bus` and `Truck`, it returns false indicating that they are not designed for daily personal use. The last line with `<:AbstractVehicle` as the input is a default value that will be applied to any other subtype of AbstractVehicle if none of the previous conditions were met, meaning they cannot be used for personal purposes by default. \n\nLet's test this function using an example:\n```julia\njulia> Vehicles = [Car(), Motorcycle(), Bus(), Truck()] # create a list of vehicles\n4-element Vector{Any}:\n Car()\n Motorcycle()\n Bus()\n Truck()\n\njulia> map(ispersonal, Vehicles) \n4-element Vector{Bool}:\n true\n true\n false\n false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,427],"elapsed":4.916783586,"_type":"aimessage"}]
