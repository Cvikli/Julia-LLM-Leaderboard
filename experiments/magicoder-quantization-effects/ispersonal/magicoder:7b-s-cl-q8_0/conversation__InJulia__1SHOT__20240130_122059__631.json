If it is, then we further check whether it's `Car` or `Motorcycle` (the personal vehicle types) by using `Union{...}`. If `T` is such a subtype, the function returns true. If not, we move on to check if it's a type of `Bus` or `Truck`, and again return false in this case. Any other subtypes are assumed to be non-personal vehicles by returning false as default.\n\nNow let's test our function:\n\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car)) # Outputs: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle)) # Outputs: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus)) # Outputs: false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck)) # Outputs: false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,322],"elapsed":3.673204114,"_type":"aimessage"}]
