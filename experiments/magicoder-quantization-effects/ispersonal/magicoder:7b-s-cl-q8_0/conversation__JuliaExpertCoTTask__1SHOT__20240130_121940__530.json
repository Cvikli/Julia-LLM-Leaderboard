All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

We then create a few functions to check if a specific vehicle type is a personal vehicle or not. The `ispersonal()` function takes in a type (`::Type{...}`) as an argument and returns true if it's a type of car or motorcycle, false otherwise.\n\nWhen calling the function with types that should return true (Car and Motorcycle), they do so, while for Bus and Truck, which are not explicitly checked in our `ispersonal` function, we default to returning false (`ispersonal(x) = false`).","status":200,"tokens":[0,294],"elapsed":3.300420584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
