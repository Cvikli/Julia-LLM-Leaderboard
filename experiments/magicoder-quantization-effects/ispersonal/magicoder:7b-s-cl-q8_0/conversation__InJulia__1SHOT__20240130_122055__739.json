All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can define this function in Julia:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T <: Car || T <: Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T <: Bus || T <: Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this code, `ispersonal` function is defined to take a Type parameter `T`. The function checks if the input Type is a subtype of either Car or Motorcycle. If it's true, the function returns `true`, signifying that the vehicle is personal for daily driving. If the type is Bus or Truck, it returns `false` indicating that they are not personal vehicles for daily driving. For any other types of vehicles, it also returns `false`.\n\nYou can test this with an example:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(AbstractVehicle)\nfalse\n```\nIn this example, you can see that `ispersonal` correctly identifies that a Car and Motorcycle are personal vehicles for daily driving (returns true), whereas Buses and Trucks are not (returns false). For an unrecognized type of vehicle, it also defaults to returning false.","status":200,"tokens":[0,394],"elapsed":4.510505979,"_type":"aimessage"}]
