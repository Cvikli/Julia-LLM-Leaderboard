All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract Vehicle end  # define the abstract type\n\n# Define subtypes of Vehicle\nstruct Car <: Vehicle end;\nstruct Motorcycle <: Vehicle end;\nstruct Bus <: Vehicle end;\nstruct Truck <: Vehicle end;\n\nfunction ispersonal(v::T) where {T<:Vehicle}  # define the function\n    if T == Car || T == Motorcycle\n        return true  # these are personal vehicles\n    elseif T == Bus || T == Truck\n        return false  # these are not for daily driving\n    end\n    return false  # default to false if type is unknown\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by pattern matching the input `v` against concrete types: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. If a match is found, the function returns `true` or `false` as per the requirements.\n\nAn example of using this function would look like this:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,303],"elapsed":3.455319837,"_type":"aimessage"}]
