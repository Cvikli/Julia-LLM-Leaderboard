All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

We use the `isa` operator to check if the given vehicle belongs to the `Car` or `Motorcycle` types (these are considered personal vehicles), and if it does, the function returns true. \n\nFor all other types (`Bus` and `Truck`), the function will return false. The `else` clause is used as a fallback for any other subtypes of AbstractVehicle that we didn't specifically check for. We then call this function with an example of a Car type to demonstrate its working:\n\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n```","status":200,"tokens":[260,305],"elapsed":5.819063728,"_type":"aimessage"}]
