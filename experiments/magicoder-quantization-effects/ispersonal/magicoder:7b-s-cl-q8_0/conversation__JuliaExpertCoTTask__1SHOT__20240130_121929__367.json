All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Then, for each specific type of vehicle (Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck), we create a new struct that inherits from one of these types.\n\nThe function `ispersonal(vehicle::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}` returns false by default for all vehicles. However, when called with an instance of any specific type of vehicle (Car or Motorcycle), it returns true as these are considered personal vehicles. For the non-personal vehicle types (Bus and Truck), it also returns false because they are defined to be such.\n\nExample:\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car()))  # Outputs: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck()))  # Outputs: false\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle()))  # Outputs: true\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,374],"elapsed":4.213248071,"_type":"aimessage"}]
