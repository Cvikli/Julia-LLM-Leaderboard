If so, it returns true indicating that the vehicle is personal for everyday driving. The function also checks if the provided Vehicle type is a Bus or Truck; in this case, it would return false, as these types are not commonly used for daily driving and are typically reserved for commercial use. For all other subtypes of AbstractVehicle, it defaults to returning false by using elseif with fallback condition.\n\nFor example: \n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car)) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle)) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus)) # false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck)) # false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,309],"elapsed":2.344370916,"_type":"aimessage"}]
