Four types of vehicles are defined as subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`. The function `ispersonal(::T)` returns a trait (i.e., `false`) for any generic vehicle type `T`, so if you call it with a random subtype, it will return false by default. Specific subtypes like `Car` and `Motorcycle` are defined to return true because these types of vehicles are personal vehicles suitable for everyday driving.\n\nExample:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,305],"elapsed":2.373373381,"_type":"aimessage"}]
