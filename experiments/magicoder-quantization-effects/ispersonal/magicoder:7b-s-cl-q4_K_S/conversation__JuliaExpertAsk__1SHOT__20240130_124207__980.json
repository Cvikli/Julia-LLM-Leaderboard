All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can define a function using the `function` keyword followed by the name of the function and arguments in parentheses. Here is how you could write your `ispersonal` function:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T <: Car || T <: Motorcycle  # check if the type is a subtype of either Car or Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T <: Bus || T <: Truck  # check if the type is a subtype of either Bus or Truck\n        return false\n    else  # if it's none of these, default to returning false\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\n\nHere are some example usages:\n\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(AbstractVehicle)  # default return value for AbstractVehicle and other unknown types\nfalse\n```\nNote that in Julia, `::Type{T}` is used to denote a type parameter (here `T`) at the time of function definition. The `where {T<:AbstractVehicle}` syntax means \"for all types `T` such that `T` is a subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,390],"elapsed":3.023842183,"_type":"aimessage"}]
