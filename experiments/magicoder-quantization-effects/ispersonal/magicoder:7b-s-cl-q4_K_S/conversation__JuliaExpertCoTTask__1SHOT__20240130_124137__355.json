Each type has a trait associated with it in the form of a function `ispersonal`, which returns true for personal vehicles (`Car` and `Motorcycle`) and false otherwise. This function uses method dispatch to determine the specific trait based on the type of vehicle being passed in. The default case for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle` is handled by returning false.","status":200,"tokens":[0,374],"elapsed":2.894111415,"_type":"aimessage"}]
