All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(v::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T == Car || T == Motorcycle  # check if it's a car or motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T == Bus || T == Truck   # check if it's a bus or truck\n        return false\n    end\n    return false                     # default value for any other vehicle type\nend\n```\nIn this function, we first define an abstract base class `AbstractVehicle`. Then we define four subtypes: Car, Motorcycle, Bus and Truck. The function `ispersonal` checks if the provided Vehicle type is a car or motorcycle, in which case it returns true. If it's not one of those two types but instead a bus or truck, it returns false. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, the default value is returned as false.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car))  # Output: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle))  # Output: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus))  # Output: false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck))  # Output: false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,341],"elapsed":2.595930083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
