All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

We then create specific dispatch functions `ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T <: AbstractVehicle}` that return true or false depending on whether a vehicle is a personal vehicle. The default behavior for any other kind of `AbstractVehicle` is to return false with the function `ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)`.\n\nTesting this code:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,331],"elapsed":2.560997622,"_type":"aimessage"}]
