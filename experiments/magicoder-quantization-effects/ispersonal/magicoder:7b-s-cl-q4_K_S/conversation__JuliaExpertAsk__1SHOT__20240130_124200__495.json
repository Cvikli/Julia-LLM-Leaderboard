All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation in Julia:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Car) = true\nispersonal(::Motorcycle) = true\nispersonal(::Bus) = false\nispersonal(::Truck) = false\nispersonal(::AbstractVehicle) = false  # for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.\n```\nIn the above code, `Car` and `Motorcycle` are defined as subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`, while `Bus` and `Truck` are not subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`. Thus, `ispersonal(::Car)` and `ispersonal(::Motorcycle)` return true (for personal vehicle), while `ispersonal(::Bus)` and `ispersonal(::Truck)` return false (not for personal vehicle). The default behaviour is that `ispersonal(::AbstractVehicle) = false`, so any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle` will also return false. \n\nFor example:\n```julia\njulia> Car()\nCar\n\njulia> Motorcycle()\nMotorcycle\n\njulia> Bus()\nBus\n\njulia> Truck()\nTruck\n\njulia> AbstractVehicle()  # This is not a subtype of `AbstractVehicle` and will return false.\nAbstractVehicle\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,372],"elapsed":2.882414556,"_type":"aimessage"}]
