All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Bus}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{Truck}) = false\n\nispersonal(::AbstractVehicle) = false # default case\n```\nIn this code, we first define an Abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and four subtypes: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, `Truck`. Then, we define a function `ispersonal(::Type{<:AbstractVehicle})` for the subtypes `Car` and `Motorcycle` that return `true`, while for types `Bus` and `Truck` it returns `false`. Finally, we define a default case where `ispersonal(::AbstractVehicle)` is set to `false`.\n\nYou can test this function with the following code:\n```julia\ncar = Car()\nmotorcycle = Motorcycle()\nbus = Bus()\ntruck = Truck()\nnon_vehicle = \"Non-vehicle\"\n\n@show ispersonal(typeof(car))  # should print true\n@show ispersonal(typeof(motorcycle))  # should print true\n@show ispersonal(typeof(bus))  # should print false\n@show ispersonal(typeof(truck))  # should print false\n@show ispersonal(typeof(non_vehicle))  # should print false, due to the default case\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,418],"elapsed":3.691864341,"_type":"aimessage"}]
