All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Then, we implement a function `ispersonal` that takes an object of any type that is derived from AbstractVehicle as parameter. \n\nInside this function, we use the `where` keyword to specify that the generic type T should be some subtype of AbstractVehicle. Based on the actual type passed to our function, we return different results: true for Car and Motorcycle, false for Bus and Truck, and a default value false for any other types.\n\nYou can test this function using `ispersonal(Car())` which should return `true`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,299],"elapsed":2.650499687,"_type":"aimessage"}]
