Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can define a function `ispersonal` like so in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract Vehicle <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: Vehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: Vehicle end\nstruct Bus <: Vehicle end\nstruct Truck <: Vehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Bus}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{Truck}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{<:Vehicle}) = false  # Default case\n```\nIn this code, `ispersonal` is a function that takes an argument of type Type. This Type can be Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck or any other subtype of Vehicle (as long as it's not Car or Motorcycle). The function checks if the type is one of these four types and returns true for those types and false for all others.\n\nYou can test this with some examples:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bicycle)  # This type does not match any of the specified types so it will return false by default.\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,340],"elapsed":3.048699497,"_type":"aimessage"}]
