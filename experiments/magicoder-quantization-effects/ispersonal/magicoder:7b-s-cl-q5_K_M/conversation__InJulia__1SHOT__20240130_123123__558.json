We define the `ispersonal` function to check if a vehicle type is a personal vehicle or not. \n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nabstract type Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nabstract type Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nabstract type Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nabstract type Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T == Car || T == Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T == Bus || T == Truck \n        return false\n    else \n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function works for types `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus` and `Truck`. For other subtypes of AbstractVehicle, it returns `false` as default. You can test the function with an example:\n\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car)) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle)) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus)) # false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck)) # false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,268],"elapsed":2.376197464,"_type":"aimessage"}]
