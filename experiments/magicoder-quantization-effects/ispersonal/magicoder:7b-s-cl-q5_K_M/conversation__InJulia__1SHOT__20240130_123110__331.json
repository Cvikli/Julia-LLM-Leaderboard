The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can define this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n# Assume there are other types of vehicles that you didn't mention.\n\nispersonal(::Type{<:Union{Car,Motorcycle}}) = true # return trait if the vehicle is a personal one\nispersonal(::Type) = false  # default to false for all other types of vehicles\n```\n\nHere we first define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` then four subtypes: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. The function `ispersonal` checks the type of input. If it is either a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`, it returns true (i.e., the trait for personal vehicle), else it defaults to false.\n\nExample:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(typeof(Car()))  # should return true\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(typeof(Bus()))   # should return false\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(typeof(Truck())) # should also return false\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,305],"elapsed":2.664391243,"_type":"aimessage"}]
