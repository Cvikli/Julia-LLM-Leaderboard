All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can define this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{<:Union{Car,Motorcycle}}) \n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{<:Union{Bus,Truck}}) \n    return false\nend\n\n# test function with example types\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n```\nIn this example, `ispersonal` function checks if the provided vehicle type is a subtype of either Car or Motorcycle (which are defined as personal vehicles). If it's not one of these two, it returns false. For instance, a Bus or Truck is not considered \"personal\" for everyday driving.","status":200,"tokens":[0,265],"elapsed":2.330843031,"_type":"aimessage"}]
