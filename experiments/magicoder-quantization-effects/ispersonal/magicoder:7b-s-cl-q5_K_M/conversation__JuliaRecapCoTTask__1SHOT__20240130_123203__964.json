[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false .

I can write a Julia function as follows:\n```julia\nabstract Vehicle end\nmutable struct Car <: Vehicle end\nmutable struct Motorcycle <: Vehicle end\nmutable struct Bus <: Vehicle end\nmutable struct Truck <: Vehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Bus}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{Truck}) = false\n\nispersonal() = false\n```\nThis function `ispersonal` checks the type of Vehicle and returns a boolean trait depending upon if the provided vehicle is personal. It works for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck as per the problem statement. For any other subtype of AbstractVehicle, it defaults to false.\n\nExample usage could be as follows:\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car))  # Outputs: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck))  # Outputs: false\nprintln(ispersonal(Bicycle))  # Outputs: false (default)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,260],"elapsed":2.342765028,"_type":"aimessage"}]
