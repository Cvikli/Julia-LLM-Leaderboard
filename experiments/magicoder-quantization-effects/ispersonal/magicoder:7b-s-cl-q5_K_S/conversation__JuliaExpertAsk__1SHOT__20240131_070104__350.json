All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation in Julia:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T == Car || T == Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T == Bus || T == Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this code, we define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and four subtypes: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. The function `ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}` takes a type as input and returns whether it is a personal vehicle or not.\n\nFor example, if we call `ispersonal(Car)`, it will return `true` because a car is typically used for daily driving. If we call `ispersonal(Bus)`, it will return `false` because buses are usually used for public transportation. For any other type of vehicle (e.g., `Truck`), the function returns `false`.\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car)) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle)) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus)) # false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck)) # false\nprintln(ispersonal(AbstractVehicle)) # false (default case)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,364],"elapsed":3.096442976,"_type":"aimessage"}]
