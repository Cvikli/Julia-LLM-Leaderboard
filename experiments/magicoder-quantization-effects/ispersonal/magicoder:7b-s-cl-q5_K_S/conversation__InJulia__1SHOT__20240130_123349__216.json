All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia programming language, you can define a type hierarchy with subtypes and implement methods that are specific to each one as shown in this problem statement. \n\nFirst, you would need to define your types:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n```\nThe `abstract` keyword means that this is an abstract type and it cannot be directly instantiated. Subtypes can inherit from the abstract types. The `<:` syntax signifies inheritance in Julia.\n\nThen, you would define your function `ispersonal`:\n```julia\nfunction ispersonal(v::T) where T <: AbstractVehicle\n    if T == Car || T == Motorcycle \n        return true\n    elseif T == Bus || T == Truck\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function checks the type of vehicle and returns a boolean value accordingly. \n\nYou can test the function with an example:\n```julia\nprint(ispersonal(Car())) # Prints true\nprint(ispersonal(Motorcycle())) # Prints true\nprint(ispersonal(Bus())) # Prints false\nprint(ispersonal(Truck())) # Prints false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,308],"elapsed":2.620281226,"_type":"aimessage"}]
