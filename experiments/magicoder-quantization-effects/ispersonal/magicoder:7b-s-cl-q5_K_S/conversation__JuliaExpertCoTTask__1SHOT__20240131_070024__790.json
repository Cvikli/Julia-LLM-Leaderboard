We then create a function `ispersonal(vehicle::T)` that takes in any object of type `T<:AbstractVehicle`, where `T` can be any subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.\n\nThe function checks if the provided vehicle is an instance of either Car or Motorcycle. If it is, the function returns true. If the vehicle is not a Car or Motorcycle but is an instance of Bus or Truck, the function returns false. For any other subtype of AbstractVehicle, the function defaults to returning false.\n\nHere's how you can test the function with your example:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,334],"elapsed":2.860570584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
