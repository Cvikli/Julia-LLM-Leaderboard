All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia solution that defines the `ispersonal` function as required:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Bus}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{Truck}) = false\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle_type::Type)\n    return false\nend\n```\nIn this code, we define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and four subtypes: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. We then define the `ispersonal` function to return true for `Car` and `Motorcycle`, and false for `Bus` and `Truck`. For any other type of vehicle, it defaults to returning false.\n\nYou can test this function with an example:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(typeof(Car))  # This should return false, as it's not a concrete type.\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,345],"elapsed":2.937512455,"_type":"aimessage"}]
