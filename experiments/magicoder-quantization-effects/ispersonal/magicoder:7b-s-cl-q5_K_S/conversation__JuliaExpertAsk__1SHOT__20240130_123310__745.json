Then we define four concrete types `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus` and `Truck` as subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`. We then define a function `ispersonal(vehicle::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}`. If the type `T` is equal to either `Car` or `Motorcycle`, it returns true. If it's equal to either `Bus` or `Truck`, it returns false. For any other subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`, it defaults to returning false.","status":200,"tokens":[0,390],"elapsed":3.406593682,"_type":"aimessage"}]
