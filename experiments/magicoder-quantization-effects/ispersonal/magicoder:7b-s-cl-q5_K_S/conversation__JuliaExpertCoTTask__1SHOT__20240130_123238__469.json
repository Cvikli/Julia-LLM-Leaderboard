All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

If not, it checks whether the vehicle is of type Bus or Truck (not personal vehicles) and returns false in this case. For all other types of AbstractVehicle, it returns false as default behaviour.\n\nWe can then test our function with an example:\n```julia\nispersonal(Car())  # true\nispersonal(Bus())  # false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,266],"elapsed":2.316495534,"_type":"aimessage"}]
