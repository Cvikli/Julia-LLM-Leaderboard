All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia solution:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Car)\n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Motorcycle)\n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Bus)\n    return false\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Truck)\n    return false\nend\n\nispersonal(::AbstractVehicle) = false\n```\nIn this code, we define the `ispersonal` function for each of the types Car and Motorcycle to return true. For Bus and Truck, we return false. The default case is handled by the last line which returns false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. \n\nYou can test it with:\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car())) # Outputs: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle())) # Outputs: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus())) # Outputs: false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck())) # Outputs: false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,283],"elapsed":2.414423207,"_type":"aimessage"}]
