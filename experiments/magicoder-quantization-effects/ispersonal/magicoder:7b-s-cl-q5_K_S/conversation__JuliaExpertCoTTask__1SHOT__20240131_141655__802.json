All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

We then define a function `ispersonal` for each of these types. For `Car` and `Motorcycle`, the function returns true, while for `Bus` and `Truck`, it returns false. The default case (for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle) is handled by another definition of `ispersonal`.\n\nYou can test this program with:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(AbstractVehicle())\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,337],"elapsed":2.886124111,"_type":"aimessage"}]
