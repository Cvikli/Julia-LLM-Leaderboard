All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia solution using abstract type and concrete type approach:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end \nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Car})\n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle})\n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Bus})\n    return false\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Truck})\n    return false\nend\n\nispersonal(::AbstractVehicle) = false\n```\n\nThe `ispersonal` function returns true for Car and Motorcycle, and false for Bus and Truck. The last line is a fallback that will return false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Here are some examples:\n```julia\n@assert ispersonal(Car) == true\n@assert ispersonal(Motorcycle) == true\n@assert ispersonal(Bus) == false\n@assert ispersonal(Truck) == false\n@assert ispersonal(struct MyVehicle <: AbstractVehicle end) == false # Test with a new subtype\n```\nRemember to use `@assert` for testing, as it will throw an error if the test fails.","status":200,"tokens":[0,322],"elapsed":2.799199498,"_type":"aimessage"}]
