Each of these subtypes is associated with a trait that indicates whether they are personal vehicles for everyday driving. For the first two types (`Car` and `Motorcycle`), the function `ispersonal` returns `true`; for the latter two (`Bus` and `Truck`), it returns `false`.\n\nFor any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, we use a default implementation that always returns `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,373],"elapsed":3.255547071,"_type":"aimessage"}]
