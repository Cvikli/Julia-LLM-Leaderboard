[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Then the function `ispersonal` is defined which takes a subtype of `AbstractVehicle` as input.\n\nIf the input type is either `Car` or `Motorcycle`, it returns true (indicating that these are personal vehicles). If the type is either `Bus` or `Truck`, it returns false, as they are not typically used for everyday driving. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, it defaults to returning false.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(typeof(Dog())) # Dog isn't a type in the given context, so it defaults to false.\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,351],"elapsed":3.088255972,"_type":"aimessage"}]
