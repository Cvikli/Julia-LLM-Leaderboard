[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

For types `Car` and `Motorcycle`, it returns true since they are personal vehicles. For types `Bus` and `Truck`, it returns false since these types represent public transportation. For any other type of vehicle that you would like to check, you can add similar functions with the same structure: \n```julia\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{YourVehicle})\n    false\nend\n```\nThis function will return false by default for all types not explicitly defined. The `false` value returned when no specific trait has been defined indicates that the vehicle is not a personal one. \n\nYou can call this function as follows: \n\n```julia\nispersonal(Car)   # true\nispersonal(Motorcycle)   # true\nispersonal(Bus)   # false\nispersonal(Truck)  # false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,371],"elapsed":3.276695343,"_type":"aimessage"}]
