Then, we define three concrete subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. We also define a function `ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle} = false`, which returns false by default for any type of vehicle that is not specifically defined as a personal vehicle. The `ispersonal` function is then specialized for the types Car and Motorcycle, returning true for these two types.\n\nWhen we print out the results of calling `ispersonal(typeof(vehicle))` for each type of vehicle, it will return \"Personal Vehicle\" for Car and Motorcycle and \"Non-Personal Vehicle\" for Bus and Truck, as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[0,430],"elapsed":3.686025287,"_type":"aimessage"}]
