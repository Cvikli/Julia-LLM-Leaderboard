The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The function `ispersonal(v::T)` checks the type of the input (`T`) and returns a boolean depending on whether it is a `Car` or a `Motorcycle` (which are personal vehicles for everyday driving) or if it's a `Bus` or `Truck`. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, the function defaults to returning false.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\n# Example usage\ncar = Car(\"Toyota\")\nmotorcycle = Motorcycle(1200)\nbus = Bus(50)\ntruck = Truck(3000.)\n\nprint(ispersonal(car))   # Prints: true\nprint(ispersonal(motorcycle))  # Prints: true\nprint(ispersonal(bus))    # Prints: false\nprint(ispersonal(truck))  # Prints: false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,407],"elapsed":3.464902145,"_type":"aimessage"}]
