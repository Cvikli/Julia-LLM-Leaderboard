All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The function `ispersonal` takes a parameter of type `AbstractVehicle` (or any of its subtypes) and checks if it is either a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`, in which case it returns `true`. If the input is either a `Bus` or a `Truck`, it returns `false`. For all other types, it defaults to returning `false`.\n\nFor example:\n```julia\njulia> Car() |> ispersonal\ntrue\n\njulia> Motorcycle() |> ispersonal\ntrue\n\njulia> Bus() |> ispersonal\nfalse\n\njulia> Truck() |> ispersonal\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,337],"elapsed":2.890477644,"_type":"aimessage"}]
