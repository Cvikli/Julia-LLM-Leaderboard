All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia implementation that defines your function `ispersonal`:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nabstract type PersonalVehicle <: AbstractVehicle end\nabstract type NonPersonalVehicle <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: PersonalVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: PersonalVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: NonPersonalVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: NonPersonalVehicle; end\n\nispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle} = false\nispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = true\n```\nIn this implementation, `PersonalVehicle` and `NonPersonalVehicle` are abstract types that define the two categories of vehicles. Then we have specific vehicle types such as Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck which inherit from these abstract types depending on whether they are personal or non-personal vehicles.\n\nThe function `ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle} = false` is a fallback case where the default behavior is to return false if you don't provide a specific type as an argument that matches one of the other cases.\n\nThen we define specific cases for Car and Motorcycle which are personal vehicles, so `ispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true` and `ispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = true`.\n\nTo check if a given type is a personal vehicle or not, you can call the function with that type as an argument:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n```\nThis shows that Car and Motorcycle are considered personal vehicles, while Truck and Bus are not. All other types of vehicles are classified as non-personal vehicles by default.","status":200,"tokens":[0,469],"elapsed":4.103474927,"_type":"aimessage"}]
