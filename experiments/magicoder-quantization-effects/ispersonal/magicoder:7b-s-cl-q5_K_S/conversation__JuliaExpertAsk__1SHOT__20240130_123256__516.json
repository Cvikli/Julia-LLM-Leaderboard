All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here is a solution in Julia programming language:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nfunction ispersonal(v::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T == Car || T == Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T == Bus || T == Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function `ispersonal` checks the type of `v`, and returns different values based on the condition. For Car and Motorcycle, it returns true, for Bus and Truck, it returns false, while for any other subtypes of AbstractVehicle, it defaults to returning false. \n\nFor example:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car()) # true\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle()) # true\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus()) # false\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck()) # false\nfalse\n```\nThis function works for the types specified, and defaults to returning false for any other subtypes of AbstractVehicle.","status":200,"tokens":[142,304],"elapsed":2.683809441,"_type":"aimessage"}]
