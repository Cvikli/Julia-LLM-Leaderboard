All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia solution for your problem:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nfunction ispersonal(v::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T == Car || T == Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T == Bus || T == Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\n\nYou can call the function `ispersonal` with a Vehicle type as an argument to get its trait:\n\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car())) # Returns true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle())) # Returns true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus())) # Returns false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck())) # Returns false\n```\n\nIn this example, `ispersonal` is a function that takes in an AbstractVehicle type and returns whether it's a personal vehicle or not. For types Car and Motorcycle, it returns true, for types Bus and Truck, it returns false. For any other subtype of AbstractVehicle, it defaults to returning false.","status":200,"tokens":[0,297],"elapsed":2.525703959,"_type":"aimessage"}]
