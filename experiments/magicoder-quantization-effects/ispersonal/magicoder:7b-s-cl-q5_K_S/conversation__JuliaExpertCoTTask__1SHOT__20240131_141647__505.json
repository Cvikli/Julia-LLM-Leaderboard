All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The function `ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}` checks if the input type is a subtype of `AbstractVehicle` and returns true or false depending on whether it's a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`, or a `Bus` or a `Truck`. If the input type does not fall into these categories, it defaults to returning false.\n\nYou can test this function using:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(AbstractVehicle) # This will return false, as AbstractVehicle is not a subtype of Car or Motorcycle.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,374],"elapsed":3.20673388,"_type":"aimessage"}]
