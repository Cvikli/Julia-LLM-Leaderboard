All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function that can solve your task:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nabstract type PersonalVehicle <: AbstractVehicle end\nabstract type NonPersonalVehicle <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: PersonalVehicle; end  # Subtype of Personal Vehicle for daily driving.\nstruct Motorcycle <: PersonalVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: NonPersonalVehicle; end  # Subtype of Non-personal Vehicle.\nstruct Truck <: NonPersonalVehicle; end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{<:PersonalVehicle}) :: Bool\n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{<:NonPersonalVehicle}) :: Bool\n    return false\nend\n\nispersonal(x::AbstractVehicle) = ispersonal(typeof(x))\n```\nIn the code above, we define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` which serves as our base type for all vehicles. Then we have two subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`, `PersonalVehicle` and `NonPersonalVehicle`. \n\nWe then create four specific types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck (all belonging to the `PersonalVehicle` type), which are all instances of their respective subtypes.\n\nThe function `ispersonal(::Type{<:PersonalVehicle}) :: Bool` is used to determine if a given vehicle is a Personal Vehicle for daily driving. This function returns true if the input is a subtype of `PersonalVehicle`, else it returns false. \n\nThe function `ispersonal(::Type{<:NonPersonalVehicle}) :: Bool` does the same but for Non-Personal Vehicles.\n\nFinally, the last line `ispersonal(x::AbstractVehicle) = ispersonal(typeof(x))` allows us to call our function on any instance of a `AbstractVehicle`. This will then call the correct `ispersonal` function for its specific type. \n\nFor example:\n```julia\nCar() |> ispersonal # returns true\nBus() |> ispersonal # returns false\nMotorcycle() |> ispersonal # returns true\nTruck() |> ispersonal # returns false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,536],"elapsed":4.939819232,"_type":"aimessage"}]
