All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

These functions return true if the given type is one of the personal vehicles (i.e., Car or Motorcycle), and false otherwise.\n\nFinally, we have a default case that returns false for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. \n\nTesting it:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(AbstractVehicle)\nfalse\n```\nAs expected, the function correctly identifies which vehicle types are personal and which are not.","status":200,"tokens":[0,391],"elapsed":3.583567564,"_type":"aimessage"}]
