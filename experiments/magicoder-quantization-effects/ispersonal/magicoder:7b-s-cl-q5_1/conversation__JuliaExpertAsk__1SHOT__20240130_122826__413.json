All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple solution in Julia that defines `ispersonal` function and uses it:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end \ntype Car <: AbstractVehicle; end \ntype Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end  \ntype Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\ntype Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle} = (T == Car || T == Motorcycle)\n\n# example usage \ncar_type = Car \nbus_type = Bus\nprint(ispersonal(car_type)) # true \nprint(ispersonal(bus_type)) # false \n```\nIn this code, we define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and then we define four subtypes: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, `Truck`. The function `ispersonal` checks if the provided Vehicle is a Car or Motorcycle and returns `true` in those cases. If the vehicle is not Car or Motorcycle, it defaults to return `false`. Then we create two variable `car_type` of type `Car`, `bus_type` of type `Bus` and call our function on these variables to demonstrate its usage.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that you don't have any other subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`. If you do, you would need a more complex solution to correctly identify if the vehicle is personal or not.","status":200,"tokens":[0,334],"elapsed":3.044398242,"_type":"aimessage"}]
