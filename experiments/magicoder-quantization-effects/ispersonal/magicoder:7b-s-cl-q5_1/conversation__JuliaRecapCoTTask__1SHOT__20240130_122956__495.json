[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can implement `ispersonal` in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Type{<:Union{Car, Motorcycle}}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{<:Union{Bus,Truck}}) = false\nispersonal(::AbstractVehicle) = false  # default for any other type of vehicle\n```\n\nTest the function with a few examples to ensure its correctness:\n\n```julia\n@test ispersonal(Car) == true\n@test ispersonal(Motorcycle) == true\n@test ispersonal(Bus) == false\n@test ispersonal(Truck) == false\n@test ispersonal(Wagon) == false  # should return false as it's not a type defined above\n```\n\nYou can add special instructions to this function by modifying the `ispersonal` definition like so:\n\n```julia\nispersonal(::Type{V}) where {V <: AbstractVehicle} = get(ENV, \"ISPERSONAL_$V\", false) == \"true\"  # default is false if not set\n```\n\nThen you can set the environment variable `ISPERSONAL_Car` to `\"true\"` or `\"false\"` to change its behavior for that specific type of vehicle. This allows you to dynamically alter how it behaves based on some external condition.","status":200,"tokens":[0,363],"elapsed":3.350847604,"_type":"aimessage"}]
