All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you could implement this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract Vehicle end\nstruct Car <: Vehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: Vehicle end\nstruct Bus <: Vehicle end\nstruct Truck <: Vehicle end\n\nispersonal(::T) where {T<:Vehicle} = false  # Default case for all other subtypes of AbstractVehicle\nispersonal(::Car) = true  \nispersonal(::Motorcycle) = true  \n```\n\nIn this function, we first define the abstract type `Vehicle` and then four concrete types: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. We then define the function `ispersonal()` to return true for instances of `Car` and `Motorcycle`, but false otherwise. The function uses generics to handle all subtypes of `Vehicle` that are not `Car` or `Motorcycle`. \n\nThis code can be used like this:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n```","status":200,"tokens":[142,299],"elapsed":2.431705097,"_type":"aimessage"}]
