All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The example then tests these functions for instances of each type.","status":200,"tokens":[0,369],"elapsed":2.969023534,"_type":"aimessage"}]
