All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is one way you can solve this problem in Julia programming language:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nmutable struct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nmutable struct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nmutable struct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nmutable struct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Bus}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{Truck}) = false\n\n# default case for subtypes of AbstractVehicle:\nispersonal(::Any) = false\n```\n\nThis function `ispersonal` takes a type as an argument and returns the trait (boolean value). The trait is determined by whether the vehicle type is a Car or Motorcycle, which are personal vehicles. For Bus and Truck, it's not suitable for everyday driving. The default case covers all other types that are subtypes of AbstractVehicle.\n\nYou can test this function with the following code:\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car)) # returns true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle)) # returns true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus)) # returns false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck)) # returns false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,303],"elapsed":2.450731629,"_type":"aimessage"}]
