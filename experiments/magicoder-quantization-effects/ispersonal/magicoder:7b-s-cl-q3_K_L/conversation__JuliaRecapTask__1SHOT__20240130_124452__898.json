[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving.

Here is how: \n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\ntype Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\ntype Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\ntype Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\ntype Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nfunction ispersonal(v::AbstractVehicle)\n    return false # Default behaviour, can be overridden below\nend\n\nispersonal(v::Car) = true \nispersonal(v::Motorcycle) = true \nispersonal(v::Bus) = false\nispersonal(v::Truck) = false\n```\n\nIn this code, we define a hierarchy of types `AbstractVehicle` to be the supertype and `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, `Truck` as subtypes. Then we use multiple dispatch to override the default behaviour for specific subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`. \n\nThe function `ispersonal(v::AbstractVehicle)` returns false by default, but it is overridden for types `Car` and `Motorcycle`, returning true, and for types `Bus` and `Truck`, returning false. This allows us to check the personal trait of any specific vehicle subtype.\n\nAn example usage could be:\n```julia\nv = Car()\n@show ispersonal(v) # Outputs: true\n\nv = Truck()\n@show ispersonal(v) # Outputs: false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[412,359],"elapsed":3.015045878,"_type":"aimessage"}]
