All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can define a function `ispersonal` that checks whether a given vehicle is a personal vehicle by using dispatch and multiple dispatch features:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle} = false\n\nispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = true\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Bus}) = false # default implementation for Bus and Truck\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Truck}) = false\n```\n\nWith this code, you can check if a specific vehicle type is a personal vehicle:\n\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car))     # Returns true \nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle))   # Returns true \nprintln(ispersonal(Bus))    # Returns false (default)\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck))   # Returns false (default)\n```\n\nFor any other subtype of AbstractVehicle, the function will return `false` as specified in our default implementation.","status":200,"tokens":[0,296],"elapsed":2.269679143,"_type":"aimessage"}]
