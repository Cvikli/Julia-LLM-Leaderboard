All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Then we create instances of these types (`Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, `Truck`). We override the behavior for `ispersonal(v::AbstractVehicle)` function with a default return value of `false`. However, we provide definitions for `ispersonal(v::Car)` and `ispersonal(v::Motorcycle)`, returning true.\n\nYou can test this function with the example:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,361],"elapsed":2.791499425,"_type":"aimessage"}]
