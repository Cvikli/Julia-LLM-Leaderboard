The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

It then creates a function `ispersonal(vehicle::T)` where T is any subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. The function checks if the input vehicle is an instance of either `Car` or `Motorcycle` by using the `isa` operator, which returns true if the object on the left side is the same type as (the same \"kind\" of) the object on the right side. If it is, the function returns `true`. If not, it checks if the vehicle is an instance of either `Bus` or `Truck`. If it is, the function returns `false`. If neither of these conditions are met (meaning the vehicle is some other subtype), then the function defaults to returning `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,330],"elapsed":2.563622091,"_type":"aimessage"}]
