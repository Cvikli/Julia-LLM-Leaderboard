All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

This function serves as a default implementation, which can be overridden by custom implementations provided in specific subtypes.\n- The test at the end of this code verifies that our function works as expected for each type of vehicle.","status":200,"tokens":[0,324],"elapsed":2.477081887,"_type":"aimessage"}]
