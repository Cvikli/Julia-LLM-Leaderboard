All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract Vehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: Vehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: Vehicle end\nstruct Bus <: Vehicle end\nstruct Truck <: Vehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(v::T) where {T<:Vehicle}\n    if T == Car || T == Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T == Bus || T == Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\nHere, `ispersonal` function works for types `Car` and `Motorcycle`, where it returns true. It also works for `Bus` and `Truck`, returning false. For any other subtype of Vehicle, the function defaults to returning false. The type `AbstractVehicle` is not included in the code as this task only requires the types `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`.\n\nYou can test the function with following example:\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car())) # Outputs: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus()))  # Outputs: false\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle()))  # Outputs: true\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,290],"elapsed":2.228863154,"_type":"aimessage"}]
