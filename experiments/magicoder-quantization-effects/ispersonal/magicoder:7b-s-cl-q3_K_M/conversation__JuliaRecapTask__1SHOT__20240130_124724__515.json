[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving.

It then defines a function `ispersonal` that takes in any Vehicle subtype and returns true if the vehicle is a car or motorcycle (since they are personal vehicles for everyday driving), otherwise it defaults to false. \n\nHere's an example of how you can use this function:\n```julia\njulia> mycar = Car()\nCar()\n\njulia> mymotorbike = Motorcycle()\nMotorcycle()\n\njulia> ispersonal(mycar)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(mymotorbike)\ntrue\n\njulia> mybus = Bus()\nBus()\n\njulia> ispersonal(mybus)\nfalse\n\njulia> mytruck = Truck()\nTruck()\n\njulia> ispersonal(mytruck)\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,427],"elapsed":3.400099719,"_type":"aimessage"}]
