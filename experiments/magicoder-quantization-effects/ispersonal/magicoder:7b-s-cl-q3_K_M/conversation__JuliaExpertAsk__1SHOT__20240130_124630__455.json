All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function that accomplishes this task. We'll define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and several concrete types: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. Then we will implement the `ispersonal` function. \n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\ntypealias Car <: AbstractVehicle end\ntypealias Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\ntypealias Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\ntypealias Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(v::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    return false\nend\n\nispersonal(::Car) = true\nispersonal(::Motorcycle) = true\n```\nNow you can check which types are personal vehicles with the function `ispersonal`. For example, if we call `ispersonal(Truck())`, it will return `false` since trucks are not typically used for everyday driving. But if you call `ispersonal(Car())`, it returns `true` because cars are typically used for everyday driving.\n\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car())) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck())) # false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,283],"elapsed":2.177131304,"_type":"aimessage"}]
