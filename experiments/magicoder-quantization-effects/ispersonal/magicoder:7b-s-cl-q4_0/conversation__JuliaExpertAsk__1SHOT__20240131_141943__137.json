All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T <: Car || T <: Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T <: Bus || T <: Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this code, the `ispersonal` function checks whether a given type `T<:AbstractVehicle` is a subtype of either Car or Motorcycle (i.e., it returns true), or Bus or Truck (i.e., it returns false). For any other subtype of AbstractVehicle, the function defaults to returning false.\n\nFor example, `ispersonal(Car)` would return `true`, while `ispersonal(Truck)` would return `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,244],"elapsed":1.835037682,"_type":"aimessage"}]
