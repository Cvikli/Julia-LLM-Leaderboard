The function `ispersonal` checks whether a vehicle is an instance of either Car or Motorcycle (which are personal vehicles), returns true if it is, false otherwise. If the vehicle isn't one of the specified types, it defaults to returning false.\n\nExample:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,252],"elapsed":1.905200497,"_type":"aimessage"}]
