All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible solution in Julia that uses multiple dispatch. We'll define several methods for `ispersonal` with different signatures: one method per type, and we use the `@static if` to call the appropriate method depending on the argument's actual type:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::T) where {T<:Union{Car,Motorcycle}}\n    return true\nend\n\n@static if VERSION â‰¥ v\"1.6\"\n    function ispersonal(::T) where {T<:Union{Bus,Truck}}\n        return false\n    end\nelse\n    function ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:Union{Bus,Truck}}\n        return false\n    end\nend\n\nispersonal(x) = false # fallback case for any other type of vehicle\n```\nThe example of usage would be as follows: \n\n```julia\njulia> Car() |> ispersonal\ntrue\n\njulia> Motorcycle() |> ispersonal\ntrue\n\njulia> Bus() |> ispersonal\nfalse\n\njulia> Truck() |> ispersonal\nfalse\n\njulia> SomeOtherType() |> ispersonal\nfalse\n```\nThis way, the function `ispersonal` would return a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving.","status":200,"tokens":[0,374],"elapsed":2.839777969,"_type":"aimessage"}]
