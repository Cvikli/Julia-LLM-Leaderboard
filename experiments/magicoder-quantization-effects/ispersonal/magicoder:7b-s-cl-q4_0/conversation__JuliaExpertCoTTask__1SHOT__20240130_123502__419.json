All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

For any other subtypes of AbstractVehicle (i.e., Bike, Plane etc.), `ispersonal` defaults to return false. \n\nExample usage:\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car()))   # Outputs: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus()))   # Outputs: false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,322],"elapsed":2.462129719,"_type":"aimessage"}]
