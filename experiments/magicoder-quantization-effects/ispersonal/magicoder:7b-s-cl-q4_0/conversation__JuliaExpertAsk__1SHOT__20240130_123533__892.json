All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is a Julia code that defines this `ispersonal` function:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end  # abstract base type for all vehicles\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end   # struct subtype representing a car\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end  # struct subtype representing a motorcycle\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end    # struct subtype representing a bus\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end   # struct subtype representing a truck\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Car})\n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle})\n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Truck})\n    return false\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Bus})\n    return false\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle_type)\n    return false   # default value for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle\nend\n```\nHere, `ispersonal` function is defined to check if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle or not. It works for Car and Motorcycle by returning true, but returns false for Truck and Bus as they are not considered personal vehicles for everyday driving. The default case handles any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. \n\nThe usage can be demonstrated as:\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car))    # prints: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle))   # prints: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck))   # prints: false\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus))    # prints: false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,375],"elapsed":2.88193271,"_type":"aimessage"}]
