All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can define such a function in Julia:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T == Car || T == Motorcycle \n        return true\n    elseif T == Bus || T == Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this example, the function `ispersonal` checks whether a given vehicle type is a subtype of either `Car` or `Motorcycle`, in which case it returns `true`. For types `Bus` and `Truck`, it returns `false`. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, it also defaults to returning `false`.\n\nYou can test this function with the following example:\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car)) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle)) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus)) # false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck)) # false\nprintln(ispersonal(Bicycle)) # false (default case)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,304],"elapsed":2.283952609,"_type":"aimessage"}]
