We then define a function `ispersonal` for each of these types. The function returns true if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle, and false otherwise.\n\nThe example at the end tests the function with instances of each of the four subtypes.","status":200,"tokens":[0,302],"elapsed":2.260310457,"_type":"aimessage"}]
