All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation in Julia:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T == Car || T == Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T == Bus || T == Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this example, the function `ispersonal` checks whether a given vehicle type is a subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. If it's either a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`, it returns `true`. If it's either a `Bus` or a `Truck`, it returns `false`. For any other subtype, it defaults to returning `false`.\n\nFor example:\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car())) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle())) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus())) # false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck())) # false\nprintln(ispersonal(AbstractVehicle)) # false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,291],"elapsed":2.174284684,"_type":"aimessage"}]
