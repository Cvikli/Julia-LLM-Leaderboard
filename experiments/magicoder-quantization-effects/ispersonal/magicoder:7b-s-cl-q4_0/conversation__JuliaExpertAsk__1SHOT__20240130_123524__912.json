All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem in Julia using type parametric programming and trait dispatch. Below is a solution that defines an `ispersonal` function that returns whether the vehicle is personal or not based on its type:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    true\nend\n\nispersonal(::Bus) = false\nispersonal(::Truck) = false\n```\n\nNow, let's test the function with some examples. For example, a Car is a personal vehicle:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n```\nAnd similarly for Motorcycle and Truck:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n```\nAs you can see, the function `ispersonal` returns true by default. If we pass a `Bus` or a `Truck`, it will return false as per the definition above.","status":200,"tokens":[0,282],"elapsed":2.154344843,"_type":"aimessage"}]
