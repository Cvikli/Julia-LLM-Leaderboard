All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem by using a simple conditional check in your function. Here's a possible implementation:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Car) \n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Motorcycle) \n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Bus) \n    return false\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Truck) \n    return false\nend\n\n# Test the function with an example.\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n```\n\nIn this code, we first define the abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and four concrete types `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. Then we provide separate functions for each of these types, where if the type is a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`, the function returns true, otherwise it returns false.","status":200,"tokens":[0,304],"elapsed":2.289797271,"_type":"aimessage"}]
