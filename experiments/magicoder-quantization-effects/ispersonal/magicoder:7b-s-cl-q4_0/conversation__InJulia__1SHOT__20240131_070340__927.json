All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia solution for your problem:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T <: Car || T <: Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T <: Bus || T <: Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this solution, we define a type hierarchy for vehicles. The `ispersonal` function is generic over the type of vehicle and returns whether it's a personal vehicle or not. For types Car and Motorcycle, it returns true (indicating they are personal vehicles), while for Bus and Truck it returns false (indicating they are not). For any other subtype of AbstractVehicle, it defaults to returning false.\n\nHere is an example usage:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(AbstractVehicle)\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,320],"elapsed":2.397015651,"_type":"aimessage"}]
