We then define a function `ispersonal` that takes in a vehicle of any subtype of `AbstractVehicle` and returns whether it is a personal vehicle.\n\nThe function checks if the provided type `T` is either `Car` or `Motorcycle`, returning true, as these are personal vehicles. If the type is neither `Car` nor `Motorcycle`, but it is either `Bus` or `Truck`, it returns false, as these are not personal vehicles for everyday driving.\n\nThe function defaults to returning false for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.\n\nFinally, we provide an example of calling the function with a `Car` instance:\n```julia\nispersonal(Car())\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,337],"elapsed":2.546669074,"_type":"aimessage"}]
