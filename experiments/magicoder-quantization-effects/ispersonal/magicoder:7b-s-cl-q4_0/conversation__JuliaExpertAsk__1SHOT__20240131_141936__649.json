All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia implementation that defines the `ispersonal` function:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Car)::Bool \n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Motorcycle)::Bool \n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Bus)::Bool \n    return false\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Truck)::Bool \n    return false\nend\n```\nIn the above code, we define four types of vehicles: Car, Motorcycle, Bus and Truck. Each vehicle type is a subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. We also define four functions `ispersonal` for each vehicle type. These functions return true if the vehicle is personal (i.e., it's either a car or motorcycle) and false otherwise.\n\nHere is an example usage:\n```julia\njulia> Car() |> ispersonal\ntrue\n\njulia> Motorcycle() |> ispersonal\ntrue\n\njulia> Bus() |> ispersonal\nfalse\n\njulia> Truck() |> ispersonal\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,310],"elapsed":2.337557017,"_type":"aimessage"}]
