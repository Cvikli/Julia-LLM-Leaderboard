The function `ispersonal` checks if a given vehicle is of type `Car` or `Motorcycle`, in which case it returns true, otherwise it checks if the vehicle is of type `Bus` or `Truck`, in which case it returns false. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, the function defaults to returning false.\n\nFor example, calling `ispersonal(Car())` would return `true`, while calling `ispersonal(Truck())` would return `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,291],"elapsed":2.180013596,"_type":"aimessage"}]
