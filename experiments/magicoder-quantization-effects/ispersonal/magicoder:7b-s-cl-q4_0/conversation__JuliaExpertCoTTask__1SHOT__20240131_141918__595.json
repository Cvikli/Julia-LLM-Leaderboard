All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you could define this function as follows:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Union{Car,Motorcycle}) = true\nispersonal(::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle} = false\n```\nThis function `ispersonal` checks if the provided Vehicle type is a subtype of AbstractVehicle. If it is, it returns whether or not this vehicle is personal for everyday driving. The function defaults to returning false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.\n\nSo, when you call `ispersonal(Car())`, it will return true because Car is a type that represents a car and cars are generally used for daily commuting. On the other hand, calling `ispersonal(Bus())` would return false since buses are not typically used for everyday driving.","status":200,"tokens":[0,236],"elapsed":1.78222951,"_type":"aimessage"}]
