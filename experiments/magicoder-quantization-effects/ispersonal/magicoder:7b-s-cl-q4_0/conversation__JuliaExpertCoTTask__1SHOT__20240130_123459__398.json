All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation in Julia:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    return (T == Car || T == Motorcycle)\nend\n```\nThis function uses a trait of the vehicle type to determine if it's a personal vehicle. This solution works for Car and Motorcycle, but returns false for Bus and Truck as per your request. For any other subtype of AbstractVehicle, this function defaults to false because no specific trait has been defined for them in the problem statement.","status":200,"tokens":[0,180],"elapsed":1.368375027,"_type":"aimessage"}]
