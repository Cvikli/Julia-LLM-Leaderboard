All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T == Car || T == Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T == Bus || T == Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a parametric type to determine the type of vehicle being passed in. If the vehicle is either a Car or a Motorcycle, it returns `true`. If the vehicle is either a Bus or a Truck, it returns `false`. For any other subtype of AbstractVehicle, it defaults to returning `false`.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car))  # Output: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus))  # Output: false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck))  # Output: false\nprintln(ispersonal(AbstractVehicle))  # Output: false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,283],"elapsed":2.120238158,"_type":"aimessage"}]
