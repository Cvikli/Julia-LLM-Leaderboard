All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

If it does, we return true; otherwise, we return false. \n\nYou can test the function by calling `ispersonal(Car())` or any other specific vehicle type you wish. The result will be `true` if the vehicle is personal and `false` for all non-personal vehicles (such as Bus and Truck).","status":200,"tokens":[0,249],"elapsed":1.898730498,"_type":"aimessage"}]
