All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

We then define a function `ispersonal` which returns whether the given vehicle is either a Car or a Motorcycle. If the vehicle is neither of these, the function will return `false`.\n\nIn this example, the Car and Motorcycle instances would return true when passed to `ispersonal`, while Bus and Truck instances would return false. For any other types of Vehicles, the function returns false as it is not specified what behavior it should have for them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,286],"elapsed":2.18230957,"_type":"aimessage"}]
