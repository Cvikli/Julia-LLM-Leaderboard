All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

If the type is Car or Motorcycle, it returns true indicating that these are personal vehicles for everyday driving. For types Bus or Truck, it returns false indicating that they are not personal vehicles. For any other subtype of AbstractVehicle, it also returns false by default.\n\nFor example: \n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(AbstractVehicle()) # false by default\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[112,408],"elapsed":3.12092438,"_type":"aimessage"}]
