All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia solution for your problem:\n\n```julia\nabstract type Vehicle <: AbstractVehicle end  # abstract vehicle\nabstract type PersonalVehicle <: Vehicle end  # personal vehicle\nabstract type AbstractVehicle <: Vehicle end   # default vehicle\n\nstruct Car <: PersonalVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: PersonalVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: Vehicle end\nstruct Truck <: Vehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle} = false  # Default trait for any vehicle.\nispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true   # Car is a personal vehicle.\nispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = true # Motorcycle is a personal vehicle.\nispersonal(::Type{T<:Vehicle}) where {T<:Bus} = false  # Bus and Truck are not personal vehicles.\n```\nThe `ispersonal` function checks the type of input and returns whether it is a PersonalVehicle. By default, it's assumed that any vehicle is not a PersonalVehicle, so we return false for types of AbstractVehicle. But this can be overridden by defining an individual trait for each PersonalVehicle type (Car and Motorcycle). This solution assumes you have access to the struct definitions of these types. If they're defined in another package or module, you would import that first before declaring them as types in your code.\n  \nTest the function with `ispersonal(Car())` which should return true and `ispersonal(Bus())` which returns false.","status":200,"tokens":[0,368],"elapsed":2.843530936,"_type":"aimessage"}]
