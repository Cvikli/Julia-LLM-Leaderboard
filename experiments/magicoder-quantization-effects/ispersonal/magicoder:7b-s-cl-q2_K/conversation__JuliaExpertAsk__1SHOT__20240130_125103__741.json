All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract Vehicle <: AbstractVehicle end \n\nmutable struct Car <: Vehicle end \nmutable struct Motorcycle <: Vehicle end \nmutable struct Bus <: Vehicle end \nmutable struct Truck <: Vehicle end \n\nfunction ispersonal(veh::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle} = false\nispersonal(::Car) = true\nispersonal(::Motorcycle) = true\n```\nThis defines an abstract supertype `AbstractVehicle`, with four concrete subtypes, and a function that returns false for all instances of any other kind of vehicle. For the specific subtypes we want it to return true: `Car` and `Motorcycle`. The `where {T<:AbstractVehicle}` syntax is used in the definition of the generic method `ispersonal(veh::T)`. \n\nHere's an example usage of this function:\n```julia\nc = Car()\nm = Motorcycle()\nb = Bus()\nt = Truck()\na = AbstractVehicle() # This won't compile as it's not a concrete subtype of AbstractVehicle.\n\nprintln(ispersonal(c)) # Should print: true\nprintln(ispersonal(m)) # Should print: true\nprintln(ispersonal(b)) # Should print: false (default to false)\nprintln(ispersonal(t)) # Should print: false (default to false)\nprintln(ispersonal(a)) # This won't compile as it's not a concrete subtype of AbstractVehicle. \n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,383],"elapsed":2.912361647,"_type":"aimessage"}]
