All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end  # define abstract supertype\n\nmutable struct Car <: AbstractVehicle\n    make::String\n    model::String\nend\n\nmutable struct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle\n    make::String\n    model::String\nend\n\nmutable struct Bus <: AbstractVehicle\n    company::String\n    model::String\nend\n\nmutable struct Truck <: AbstractVehicle\n    manufacturer::String\n    model::String\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(v::AbstractVehicle)\n    if v isa Car || v isa Motorcycle  # check if the vehicle is a car or motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif v isa Bus || v isa Truck  # check if the vehicle is a bus or truck\n        return false\n    end\n    return false  # default to false for all other vehicle types\nend\n```\nIn this code, we defined four different types of vehicles: Car, Motorcycle, Bus and Truck. Each one of them has its own properties and methods, such as \"make\", \"model\" etc. There is a supertype called AbstractVehicle which makes the function `ispersonal` able to check all these types.\n\nThe function checks if the vehicle is an instance of Car or Motorcycle, then return true. If not, it further checks whether the vehicle is Bus or Truck, then return false. In any other cases, the function returns false by default. \n\nFor example: `car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\"); print(ispersonal(car))` would output `true`, indicating that this car is a personal vehicle for everyday driving.","status":200,"tokens":[0,385],"elapsed":2.927452919,"_type":"aimessage"}]
