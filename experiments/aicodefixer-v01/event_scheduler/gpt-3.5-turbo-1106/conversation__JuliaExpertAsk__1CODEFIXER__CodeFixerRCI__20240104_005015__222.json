It must not repeat.\n\n2. **Critique Step Instructions:** \n- Read the user request word-by-word. Does the code implementation follow the request to the the letter? Think it though step-by-step.\n- Review the provided feedback in detail.\n- Provide 2-3 bullet points of criticism for the code. Each bullet point must refer to a different type of error or issue.\n    - If there are any errors, explain why and what needs to be changed to FIX THEM! Be specific. \n    - If an error repeats or critique repeats, previous issue was not addressed. YOU MUST SUGGEST A DIFFERENT IMPROVEMENT THAN BEFORE.\n    - If there are no errors, identify and list specific issues or areas for improvement to write more idiomatic Julia code.\n\n\n3. **Improve Step Instructions:** \n- Specify what you'll change to address the above critique.\n- Provide the revised code reflecting your suggested improvements.
