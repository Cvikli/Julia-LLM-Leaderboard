The first test case checks the function behavior when an empty list is provided, the second and third test cases check for no conflicts when events do not overlap, and the last test case checks for a conflict when events overlap.\n\nTo run the tests, you can execute the script in your terminal or REPL. If the tests pass, you will see a message like \"ALL TESTS PASSED\". If any test fails, the failing test case name and error message will be displayed.
