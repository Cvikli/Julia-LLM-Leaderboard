Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia using Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple})\n    events |> unique |> begin\n        isempty(events) && return \"No events\"\n        conflicts = false\n        for (_, next) in pairs(events)\n            _, start = next\n            for (_, prev) in reverse(collect(pairs(events)))\n                prev_end = start + Duration(hour=prev[2]-1, minute=prev[3])\n                start < prev_end && (conflicts = true; break)\n            end\n        end\n        conflicts ? \"Conflict\" : \"No conflicts\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Dates` package to parse the dates and durations, and checks for scheduling conflicts by iterating through the unique, sorted events and checking if any event starts before the previous event ends. If a conflict is found, it returns the string \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events or \"No events\" if the input list is empty.","status":200,"tokens":[162,242],"elapsed":2.193664333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
