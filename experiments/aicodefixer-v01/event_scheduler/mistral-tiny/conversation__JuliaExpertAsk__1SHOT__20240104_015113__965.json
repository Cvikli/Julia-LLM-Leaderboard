It uses the `Dates` package to parse and compare the datetime values. The function checks for scheduling conflicts by comparing the start and end times of each event using the `isoverlapping` function. If there's an overlap, the function returns \"Conflict\", otherwise it returns \"No conflicts\" or \"No events\" depending on the input.","status":200,"tokens":[162,304],"elapsed":2.89092925,"_type":"aimessage"}]
