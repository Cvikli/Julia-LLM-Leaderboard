Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia using Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events :: AbstractVector{Tuple})\n    length(events) < 1 && return \"No events\"\n\n    sorted_events = sort(events, by = first)\n    last_event_end = date(\"0001-01-01 00:00:00\")\n\n    for event in sorted_events\n        start_event = first(event)\n        finish_event = last(event)\n\n        if finish_event < last_event_end\n            last_event_end = finish_event\n        else\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a vector of tuples as an argument and uses the Dates package to parse the dates. It first checks if the list is empty and returns \"No events\" if it is. It then sorts the events based on their start times and iterates through them, updating the last event end time. If an event ends before the last event end time, the last event end time is updated. If an event ends after the last event end time, a scheduling conflict is detected and the function returns \"Conflict\". If all events are processed without a conflict, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[162,289],"elapsed":2.666528,"_type":"aimessage"},{"content":"### Execution Results\n\n```plaintext\nExecution has been successful (no errors detected).
