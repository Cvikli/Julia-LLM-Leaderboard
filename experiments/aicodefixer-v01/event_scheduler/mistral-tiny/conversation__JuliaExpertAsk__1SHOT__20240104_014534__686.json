For each event, it checks if it overlaps with the current event or the last event in the list. If there is an overlap, it returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it continues to the next event. If all events have unique time slots, it returns \"No conflicts\". If the input is empty, it also returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[162,282],"elapsed":8.351719167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
