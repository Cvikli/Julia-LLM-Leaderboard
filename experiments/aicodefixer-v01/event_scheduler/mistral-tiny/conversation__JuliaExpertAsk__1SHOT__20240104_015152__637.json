Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia using Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    sorted_events = sort(events, by = x -> parse(DateTime, x[1]))\n    previous_end_time = DateTime(\"0001-01-01 00:00:00\")\n\n    for event in sorted_events\n        start_time = parse(DateTime, event[1])\n        end_time = parse(DateTime, event[2])\n\n        if end_time < previous_end_time || start_time >= previous_end_time\n            return \"No conflicts\"\n        end\n\n        previous_end_time = end_time\n    end\n\n    length(sorted_events) == length(events) ? \"No conflicts\" : \"Conflict\"\nend\n\n```\n\nThis function `event_scheduler` takes a vector of tuples as an argument, where each tuple represents an event with a start and a finish time. It uses the `Dates` package to parse the string dates and times into `DateTime` objects. The function sorts the events based on their start times and checks for conflicts by comparing the end time of each event with the start time of the next event. If there are no conflicts or the list is empty, it returns \"No conflicts\". Otherwise, it returns \"Conflict\".","status":200,"tokens":[162,304],"elapsed":2.744897958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
