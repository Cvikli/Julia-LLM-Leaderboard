It uses the Dates package to parse the datetime strings. The function sorts the events based on their start times and checks for any conflicts by comparing the end time of the previous event with the start time of the current event. If the current event starts before the previous event ends, then there is a conflict. The function returns \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events, \"Conflict\" if any events overlap, and \"No events\" if the list is empty.","status":200,"tokens":[162,372],"elapsed":3.368644375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
