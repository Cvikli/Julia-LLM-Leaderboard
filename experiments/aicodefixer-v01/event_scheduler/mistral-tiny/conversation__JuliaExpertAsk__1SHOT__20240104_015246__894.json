The `sort!` function is used to sort the events based on their start times. The `current_time` variable is then initialized to the start time of the first event. The function then iterates through the sorted events and checks if the end time of each event is greater than the current time. If it is, the function continues to the next event. If not, there is a scheduling conflict, and the function returns \"Conflict\". If all events are processed without any conflict, the function returns \"No conflicts\". If the input is empty, the function returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[162,474],"elapsed":13.285018459,"_type":"aimessage"}]
