Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia function that fulfills the requirements:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    sorted_events = sort(events, by = x -> Dates.DateTime(x[1]))\n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if sorted_events[i][1] < sorted_events[i-1][2]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nYou can parse the timestamps using the `DateTime` function from the `Dates` package, and then sort the events based on their start times.
