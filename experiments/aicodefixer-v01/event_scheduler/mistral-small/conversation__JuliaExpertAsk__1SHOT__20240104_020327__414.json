Then, it checks for conflicts by iterating through unique start times and finding events that overlap with the current start time within a 1-minute margin. If any conflicts are found, the function returns \"Conflict\"; otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[162,291],"elapsed":3.925515292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
