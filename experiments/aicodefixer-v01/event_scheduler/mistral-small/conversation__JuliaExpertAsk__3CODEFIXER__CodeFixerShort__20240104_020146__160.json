Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia function that meets your requirements:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    else\n        sorted_events = sort(events, by = x -> parse(DateTime, x[1]))\n        for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n            if parse(DateTime, sorted_events[i][1]) < parse(DateTime, sorted_events[i-1][2])\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n        return \"No conflicts\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty, and returns the appropriate message.
