The function first checks if the input list is empty and returns the appropriate message. If not, it sorts the events by start time, finds unique start times, and then checks if there are any conflicts by ensuring that there's at most one event at each start time and that the event finishing time is not before the start time. If a conflict is found, the function returns \"Conflict\", otherwise it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[162,369],"elapsed":4.974805292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
