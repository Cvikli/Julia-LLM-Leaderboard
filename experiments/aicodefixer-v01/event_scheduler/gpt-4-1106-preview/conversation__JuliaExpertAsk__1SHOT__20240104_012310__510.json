It first checks for an empty list of events. Then, it converts the string representations of the start and finish times into `DateTime` objects. After sorting the events by their start times, it iterates through the sorted list to check for any overlaps. If any overlap is detected, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no overlaps are found, it returns \"No conflicts\" at the end.","status":200,"tokens":[146,264],"elapsed":25.17004975,"_type":"aimessage"}]
