It must not repeat.\n\n2. **Critique Step Instructions:** \n- Read the user request word-by-word. Does the code implementation follow the request to the the letter? Think it though step-by-step.\n- Review the provided feedback in detail.\n- Provide 2-3 bullet points of criticism for the code. Each bullet point must refer to a different type of error or issue.\n    - If there are any errors, explain why and what needs to be changed to FIX THEM! Be specific. \n    - If an error repeats or critique repeats, previous issue was not addressed.

However, the code does not provide unit tests to ensure its reliability across different cases.\n- There should be checks to ensure the provided datetime strings are in the correct format. The current implementation assumes all input is well-formed and does not handle parsing errors.\n\n### Improve\n- I will include unit tests using `@testset` and `@test` to validate the functionality of the `event_scheduler` function, covering cases such as no events, non-overlapping events, and overlapping events.\n- Add a try-catch block to handle parsing errors of the datetime strings to ensure the function is robust against incorrectly formatted input.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\nusing Test\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    try\n        sorted_events = sort(events, by = x -> DateTime(x[1], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"))\n\n        for i in 1:(length(sorted_events) - 1)\n            end_prev_event = DateTime(sorted_events[i][2], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n            start_next_event = DateTime(sorted_events[i + 1][1], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n            if end_prev_event > start_next_event\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n        \n        return \"No conflicts\"\n    catch e\n        if isa(e, DateFormatError)\n            return \"Invalid date format\"\n        else\n            rethrow(e)\n        end\n    end\nend\n\n@testset \"event_scheduler tests\" begin\n    @test event_scheduler([]) == \"No events\"\n    @test event_scheduler([(\"2023-04-01 10:00\", \"2023-04-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-04-01 12:00\", \"2023-04-01 13:00\")]) == \"No conflicts\"\n    @test event_scheduler([(\"2023-04-01 10:00\", \"2023-04-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-04-01 10:30\", \"2023-04-01 12:00\")]) == \"Conflict\"\n    @test event_scheduler([(\"invalid-date\", \"2023-04-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-04-01 12:00\", \"2023-04-01 13:00\")]) == \"Invalid date format\"\nend\n```\n---","status":200,"tokens":[828,550],"elapsed":26.071567709,"_type":"aimessage"}]
