Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Using the Dates package, you can write the following function to check for scheduling conflicts:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    events = [DateTime.(replace(e, \"T\" => \" \")) for e in events]\n    sorted_events = sort!(events, by = e -> (e[1], -e[2]))\n\n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if sorted_events[i][1] <= sorted_events[i-1][2]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function first converts the input events into a list of `DateTime` objects. Then it sorts the list based on the start times, breaking ties by favoring earlier end times.\n\nAfter sorting, the function iterates through the events and checks if any event's start time is before the previous event's end time, indicating a conflict.\n\nFinally, the function returns \"No conflicts\" if no overlapping events are found, and \"Conflict\" otherwise.
