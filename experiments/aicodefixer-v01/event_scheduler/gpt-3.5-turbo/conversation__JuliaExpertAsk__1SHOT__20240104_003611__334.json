Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    events = sort(events, by=x->x[1])\n    \n    for i in 2:length(events)\n        if Dates.DateTime(events[i][1], \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM\") <= Dates.DateTime(events[i-1][2], \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM\")\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. First, we check if the list of events is empty. If it is, we return \"No events\".\n2. Next, we sort the events based on their start time.\n3. Then, we iterate through the sorted events and compare the start time of each event with the finish time of the previous event. If the start time of an event is less than or equal to the finish time of the previous event, it means there is a scheduling conflict and we return \"Conflict\".\n4. If we reach the end of the loop without finding any conflicts, we return \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[146,227],"elapsed":4.137101416,"_type":"aimessage"}]
