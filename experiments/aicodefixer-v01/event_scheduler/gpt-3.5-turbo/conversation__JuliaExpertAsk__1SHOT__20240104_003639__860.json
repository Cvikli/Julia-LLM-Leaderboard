Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort(events, by = event -> DateTime(event[1], \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM\"))\n    \n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        start_time = DateTime(sorted_events[i][1], \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM\")\n        end_time = DateTime(sorted_events[i][2], \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM\")\n        if start_time <= DateTime(sorted_events[i - 1][2], \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM\")\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. The function first checks if the `events` list is empty. If so, it immediately returns \"No events\".\n2. It then sorts the events list using the `sort` function from the standard library. The `by` argument is used to specify the sorting criterion as the start time of each event converted to a `DateTime` object.\n3. The function iterates over the sorted events using a for loop starting from the second event (index 2). \n4. Inside the loop, it compares the start time of the current event with the end time of the previous event. If the start time is less than or equal to the end time, it means there is a scheduling conflict and the function immediately returns \"Conflict\".\n5. If the loop completes without any conflicts, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[146,311],"elapsed":5.480279584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
