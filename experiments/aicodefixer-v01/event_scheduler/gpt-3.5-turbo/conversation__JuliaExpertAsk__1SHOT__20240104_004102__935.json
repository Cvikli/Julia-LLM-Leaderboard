Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's the implementation of the `event_scheduler` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    events = sort!(events, by=x->Dates.DateTime(x[1]))\n    \n    for i in 2:length(events)\n        if Dates.DateTime(events[i][1]) < Dates.DateTime(events[i-1][2])\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list of events is empty and returns \"No events\" in that case. Otherwise, it sorts the events by their start time in ascending order using the `Dates.DateTime` constructor. Then, it iterates through the sorted events and checks if the start time of the current event is less than the finish time of the previous event. If there is such an overlap, it returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nYou will need to make sure to pass in the events as a list of tuples in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`.","status":200,"tokens":[146,229],"elapsed":4.355417667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
