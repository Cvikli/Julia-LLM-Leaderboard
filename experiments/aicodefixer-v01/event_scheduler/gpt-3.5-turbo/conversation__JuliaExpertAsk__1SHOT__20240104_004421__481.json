It first checks if the list is empty and returns \"No events\" in that case. Then, it converts the start and finish times of each event into `DateTime` objects using the specified format. Using two nested loops, it compares each pair of events and checks if their respective start and finish times overlap. If any overlaps are found, the function returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[146,266],"elapsed":4.250885167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
