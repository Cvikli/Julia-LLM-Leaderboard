Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that accomplishes this:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, CategoricalArrays\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    # Filter the data for rows with manufacturer \"audi\" and model being \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\"\n    df_audi = filter(row -> row[:manufacturer] == \"audi\" && (row[:model] == \"a4\" || row[:model] == \"a4 quattro\"), df_cars)\n    \n    # Add a new column `audi_a4_type` with value `true` across all rows in the filtered data frame\n    df_audi[!, :audi_a4_type] = trues(nrow(df_audi))\n    \n    return df_audi\nend\n```\n\nThis function filters `df_cars` to only include rows where the `manufacturer` is `\"audi\"` and the `model` is either `\"a4\"` or `\"a4 quattro\"`.
