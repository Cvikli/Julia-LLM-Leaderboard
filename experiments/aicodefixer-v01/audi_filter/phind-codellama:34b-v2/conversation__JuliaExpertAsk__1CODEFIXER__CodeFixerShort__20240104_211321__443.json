In Julia, it's often more efficient to use the `view` function when filtering data frames, as this allows for memory-mapped operations and can avoid copying large amounts of data. Here is how I would modify the given function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    # filter the data for rows where manufacturer is \"audi\" and model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\" using a view\n    df_filtered = @view df_cars[(df_cars.manufacturer .== \"audi\") .& (df_cars.model .∈ [\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"]), :]\n    \n    # add a new column :audi_a4_type with value `true` across all rows in the filtered data frame\n    insertcols!(df_filtered, :audi_a4_type => true)\n    \n    return df_filtered\nend\n```\nThe primary change here is using the `@view` macro and the broadcasting operators `.==` and `.∈`. These changes allow for more efficient filtering of large data frames.","status":200,"tokens":[605,274],"elapsed":54.269898667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
