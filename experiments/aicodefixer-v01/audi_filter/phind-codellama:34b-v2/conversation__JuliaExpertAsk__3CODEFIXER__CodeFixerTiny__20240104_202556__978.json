Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use the `filter` function from DataFrames.jl along with `transform!` to add a new column. Here is an example implementation of the audi_filter function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df::DataFrame)\n    # Filter down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”\n    filtered = filter(row -> row[:manufacturer] == \"audi\" && (row[:model] == \"a4\" || row[:model] == \"a4 quattro\"), df)\n    \n    # Create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows in the filtered DataFrame\n    transform!(filtered, [:manufacturer => (x -> true) => :audi_a4_type])\n    \n    return filtered\nend\n```\n\nYou can call this function with a DataFrame `df_cars`:\n\n```julia\nresult = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```\n\nNote that the transform! operation above uses the \"broadcast syntax\" for DataFrames.jl. The anonymous function `(x -> true)` is applied to every element of the `manufacturer` column, and the result is used to create a new column `:audi_a4_type`.
