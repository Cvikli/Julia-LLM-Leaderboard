Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

First, you need to import the DataFrames and CSV packages using the following commands: `using DataFrames` and `using CSV`.\n2. Then, assuming that your data is in a CSV file named \"car_data.csv\", load it into a DataFrame named `df_cars`: `df_cars = CSV.read(\"car_data.csv\")`.\n3. Finally, call the function `audi_filter` on the `df_cars` DataFrame: `result = audi_filter(df_cars)`. This will return a new DataFrame with the conditions and new column specified.","status":200,"tokens":[162,310],"elapsed":48.1624885,"_type":"aimessage"}]
