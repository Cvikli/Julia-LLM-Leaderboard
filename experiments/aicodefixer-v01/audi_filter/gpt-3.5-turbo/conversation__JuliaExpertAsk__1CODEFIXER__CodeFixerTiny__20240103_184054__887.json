Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    filter_rows = (df_cars.manufacturer .== \"audi\") .& (df_cars.model .== \"a4\" .|| df_cars.model .== \"a4 quattro\")\n    df_cars = df_cars[filter_rows, :]\n    df_cars[!,:audi_a4_type] = true\n    return df_cars\nend\n```\n\nHere's a function `audi_filter` that takes a DataFrame `df_cars` as input. It first filters down the dataset to rows where the manufacturer is \"audi\" and the model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". Then it creates a new column `audi_a4_type` and assigns `true` to all rows. Finally, it returns the resulting DataFrame with the filtered and new column added.","status":200,"tokens":[137,184],"elapsed":7.214033541,"_type":"aimessage"},{"content":"### Execution Results\n\n```plaintext\nExecution has been successful (no errors detected).
