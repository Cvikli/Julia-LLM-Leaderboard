Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

Below is the function `audi_filter` written in Julia that accomplishes the described task:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    # Filter the DataFrame to include only rows with manufacturer \"audi\" and models \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\"\n    filtered_df = filter(row -> row.manufacturer == \"audi\" &&\n                                (row.model == \"a4\" || row.model == \"a4 quattro\"), df_cars)\n    \n    # Adding a new column `audi_a4_type` with the value `true` across all rows\n    filtered_df[!, :audi_a4_type] = true\n\n    return filtered_df\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes as input a DataFrame `df_cars` and returns a filtered DataFrame as specified. Make sure that `DataFrames` is included in your current Julia environment to use the `DataFrame` type and `filter` function.\n\nTo apply this function to a DataFrame `df_cars`, simply pass the DataFrame to the function like this:\n\n```julia\ndf_filtered = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[137,231],"elapsed":22.696739584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
