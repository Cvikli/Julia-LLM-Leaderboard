Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

Finally, it returns the resulting `DataFrame`.\n\nMake sure to use `hackquote` for creating new columns in case you are using Julia version ≤ 1.5. If you are using Julia version > 1.5, replace `hackquote` with `DataFrame(; df, newcol)`.","status":200,"tokens":[153,254],"elapsed":2.219754041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
