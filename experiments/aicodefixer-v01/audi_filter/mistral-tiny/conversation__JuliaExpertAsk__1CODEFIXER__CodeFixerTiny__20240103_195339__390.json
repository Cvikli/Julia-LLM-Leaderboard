Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia function audi_filter(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    subset = filter(df_cars, [:manufacturer => \"audi\", :model => .∈([\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"])])\n    newcols = NotMissing(:audi_a4_type => true)\n    return hcat(subset, DataFrame(newcols))\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df_cars` as an argument, filters it down to rows containing \"audi\" as manufacturer and \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\" as model, and adds a new column `audi_a4_type` filled with `true` values for all filtered rows.
