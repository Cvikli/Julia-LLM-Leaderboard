Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

It uses the `subset` function to filter the rows based on the given conditions, and creates a new column filled with `true` values using `ColumnVector` and `Symbol`. The names of the columns are updated using the `names` function and finally, a new DataFrame is created and returned.","status":200,"tokens":[153,241],"elapsed":2.085361542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
