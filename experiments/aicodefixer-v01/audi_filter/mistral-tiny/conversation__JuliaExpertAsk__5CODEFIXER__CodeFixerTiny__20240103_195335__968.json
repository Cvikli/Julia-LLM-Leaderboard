Checks if the function filters the DataFrame correctly by ensuring the resulting DataFrame has the correct size and contains only rows with the \"audi\" manufacturer and \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\" models.\n2. Checks if the new column `audi_a4_type` is added and filled with `true` values for all rows in the resulting DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[718,446],"elapsed":4.062556334,"_type":"aimessage"},{"content":"### Execution Results\n\n```plaintext\n**Error Detected:** Some tests did not pass: 0 passed, 0 failed, 5 errored, 0 broken.\n\n**Output Captured:** audi_filter function tests: Error During Test at none:16\n  Test threw exception\n  Expression: size(audi_filter(df_cars)) == (2, 3)\n  TypeError: non-boolean (BitVector) used in boolean context\n  Stacktrace:\n    [1] #103\n      @ DataFrames ~/.julia/packages/DataFrames/58MUJ/src/abstractdataframe/abstractdataframe.jl:1216 [inlined]\n    [2] _broadcast_getindex_evalf\n      @ Base.Broadcast ./broadcast.jl:709 [inlined]\n    [3] _b\n```\n\nTake a deep break.
