Then it creates a new column `audi_a4_type` with the value of `true` for all rows using the `Column` constructor and `ones` function. The final result is obtained by using the `hcat` function to horizontally concatenate the `filtered_df` and the new column `new_column`.","status":200,"tokens":[153,216],"elapsed":2.154736042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
