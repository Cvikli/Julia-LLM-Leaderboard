It filters a DataFrame by manufacturer and model, and creates a new column. Here's why:\n\n1. The function `audi_filter` takes one argument: a DataFrame (`df`). \n2. In the filter operation, it uses a conditional statement to only keep rows where `manufacturer == \"audi\"` and `model in (\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\")`.\n3.
