It filters on both the manufacturer and model columns, checking if they're equal to \"audi\" or \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\", respectively, and then adds a new Boolean column named `audi_a4_type` that is set to true for all rows in the filtered DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[151,336],"elapsed":19.747110667,"_type":"aimessage"},{"content":"\nThe above Julia code has been executed with the following results:\n\n```plaintext\n**Parsing Error Detected:** ErrorException(\"syntax: \\\":_\\\" is not a valid function argument name\")\n```\n\n0.
