Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that accomplishes the task:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    df_cars[df_cars.manufacturer .== \"audi\" .& (df_cars.model .∈ [\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"]), :] =\n        [:audi_a4_type => true, :]\n    return df_cars\nend\n```\n\nThis function first filters the DataFrame `df_cars` by manufacturer \"audi\" and model \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\" using the `.==` and `.∈` operators respectively. Then it creates a new column `audi_a4_type` and assigns `true` to its values using the broadcast assignment operator `.=`. Finally, the function returns the modified DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[153,201],"elapsed":2.775336708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
