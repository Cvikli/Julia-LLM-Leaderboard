Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

This is done using the broadcasted comparison operators (`==` and `∈`) and logical AND (`&`).\n* The second line creates a new column `audi_a4_type` with a boolean value `true` for all rows that match the filter. This is done by appending a column of `true` values to the filtered DataFrame.\n* The function returns the modified DataFrame.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the `DataFrames` library is installed and loaded in your Julia environment.
