Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    df = filter(row -> row.manufacturer == \"audi\" && (row.model == \"a4\" || row.model == \"a4 quattro\"), df_cars)\n    insertcols!(df, :audi_a4_type => true)\n    return df\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* We use the `filter` function to filter down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer \"audi\" and model being \"a4 or \"a4 quattro\". The `row -> row.manufacturer == \"audi\" && (row.model == \"a4\" || row.model == \"a4 quattro\")` expression is a anonymous function that takes each row of the dataframe as input and returns true if the row meets the condition, otherwise it returns false.\n* We use `insertcols!` to insert a new column `:audi_a4_type => true` in the resulting DataFrame. The value `true` will be assigned to all rows in the new column.\n* Finally, we return the resulting DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[158,245],"elapsed":15.8887985,"_type":"aimessage"}]
