Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

It then adds a new column `audi_a4_type` to the resulting DataFrame and assigns `true` to it for all rows. The final DataFrame is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[149,192],"elapsed":4.313216917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
