The error is due to the fact that the `@where` macro is not available in the latest version of DataFrames.jl. Instead, we can use the `filter` function with a logical expression to achieve the same result. Here's the corrected solution:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    filtered_df = filter(row -> row.manufacturer == \"audi\" && (row.model == \"a4\" || row.model == \"a4 quattro\"), df_cars)\n    filtered_df[:, :audi_a4_type] = true\n    return filtered_df\nend\n```\nThis function first defines a logical expression that checks if the `manufacturer` column is equal to `\"audi\"` and the `model` column is either `\"a4\"` or `\"a4 quattro\"`.\n\nIt then uses the `filter` function to apply this expression to each row of the `df_cars` DataFrame and returns a new DataFrame containing only the rows for which the expression evaluates to `true`.\n\nFinally, it adds a new column `audi_a4_type` to the filtered DataFrame and sets its values to `true` for all rows.\n\nI hope this solution works for you. Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.","status":200,"tokens":[461,303],"elapsed":23.804008417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
