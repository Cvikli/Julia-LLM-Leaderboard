All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the `ispersonal` function in Julia:\n```\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Bus}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{Truck}) = false\nispersonal(vt::Type{<:AbstractVehicle}) = false\n\n# Example usage:\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(AbstractVehicle)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Union{Car, Motorcycle})\nERROR: MethodError: no method matching ispersonal(::Union{Car, Motorcycle})\nClosest candidates are:\n  ispersonal(!Matched::Type{<:AbstractVehicle}) at REPL[1]:8\n  ispersonal(!Matched::Type{<:AbstractVehicle}) at REPL[1]:9\n  ...\n```\nNote that the function uses multiple dispatch to handle different subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`, and it defaults to returning `false` for any other subtype that is not explicitly handled. Also note that the function is defined to take a `Type` argument rather than an instance of a `AbstractVehicle` subtype, since we want to determine whether a given type is a personal vehicle, not whether a particular instance of that type is a personal vehicle.\n\nI hope this helps!
