The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

By default, the function returns `false` for any subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. However, the function is overloaded for the specific types `Car` and `Motorcycle` to return `true`. The `Bus` and `Truck` types are not explicitly handled, so they will use the default implementation and return `false`.\n\nNote that the function does not handle the case where the input is a union of types, such as `Union{Car, Motorcycle}`. In this case, a `MethodError` will be thrown. If you want to handle this case, you can add an additional overload of the function for the union type.","status":200,"tokens":[150,481],"elapsed":18.335003459,"_type":"aimessage"}]
