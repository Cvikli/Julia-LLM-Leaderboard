The function checks if the given vehicle is either a `Car` or `Motorcycle` by using the `<:` (is a) operator and a combination of arrays and logical operators. If the given vehicle's type is not a `Car` or `Motorcycle`, then it defaults to `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[146,230],"elapsed":4.401700583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
