To fix this issue, we need to define the constructors for the `AbstractVehicle` type. I assume that the `AbstractVehicle` type is meant to be an abstract base class without instantiation. In that case, we should remove the constructors from the subtypes and only define them in the abstract base class.\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle\n    function AbstractVehicle() end\nend\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(veh::AbstractVehicle)\n    (veh isa Car) || (veh isa Motorcycle) || false\nend\n\n# Test cases\n@test ispersonal(Car()) === true\n@test ispersonal(Motorcycle()) === true\n@test ispersonal(Bus()) === false\n@test ispersonal(Truck()) === false\n@test ispersonal(AbstractVehicle()) === false\n```\n\nHere's what I have done to address the issue:\n\n1.
