All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

If the provided `AbstractVehicle` subtype is not a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`, the function returns false. If the provided `AbstractVehicle` subtype is not defined at all, the function will throw an error. To handle this, you might want to add error handling or provide a default value for unrecognized types.","status":200,"tokens":[146,277],"elapsed":2.438180916,"_type":"aimessage"}]
