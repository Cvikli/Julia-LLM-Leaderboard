The `ispersonal` function has been defined with specific implementations for `Car` and `Motorcycle` types returning `true`, and a default implementation for all other `AbstractVehicle` subtypes returning `false`. The example demonstrates the usage of the function with each vehicle type.","status":200,"tokens":[146,290],"elapsed":4.329661125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
