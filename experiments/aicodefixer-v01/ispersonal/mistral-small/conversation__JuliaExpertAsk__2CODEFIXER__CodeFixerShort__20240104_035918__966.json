It returns `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle`, and `false` for `Bus` and `Truck`. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, it defaults to `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[146,244],"elapsed":9.068966417,"_type":"aimessage"},{"content":"\nThe above Julia code has been executed with the following results:\n\n```plaintext\n**Error Detected:** UndefVarError(:Car)\n```\n\n0.
