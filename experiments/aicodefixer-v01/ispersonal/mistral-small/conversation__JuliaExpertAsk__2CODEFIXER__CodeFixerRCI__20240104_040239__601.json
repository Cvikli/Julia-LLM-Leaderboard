Think it though step-by-step.\n- Review the provided feedback in detail.\n- Provide 2-3 bullet points of criticism for the code. Each bullet point must refer to a different type of error or issue.\n    - If there are any errors, explain why and what needs to be changed to FIX THEM! Be specific. \n    - If an error repeats or critique repeats, previous issue was not addressed.

Ensure it has the same function name.\n- Write 2-3 correct and helpful unit tests for the function requested by the user (organize in `@testset \"name\" begin ... end` block, use `@test` macro).\n\n\n3. **Response Format:**\n---\n### Past Critique\n<brief bullet points on past critique>\n\n### Critique\n<list of issues as bullet points pinpointing the mistakes in the code (use inline quotes)>\n\n### Improve\n<list of improvements as bullet points with clear outline of a solution (use inline quotes)>\n\n```julia\n<provide improved code>\n```\n---\n\nBe concise and focused in all steps.\n\n### Feedback from the User\n\n**Error Detected:** UndefVarError(:Car)\n\nI believe in you.
