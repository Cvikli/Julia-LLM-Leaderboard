I realize that I made a mistake by not defining the types before the function. I will now follow your instructions and provide detailed and specific steps, along with the corrected code.\n\n1. Reviewing the user request:\n   - Define a function `ispersonal` that takes an `AbstractVehicle` type as an argument.\n   - Return `true` if the provided type is a personal vehicle (`Car` or `Motorcycle`), and `false` otherwise.\n   - Default to returning `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.\n\n2. Explain the error:\n   The error `UndefVarError(:Car)` appeared because the `Car` type was not defined before the function was implemented.\n\n3.
