The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

By defining the method `ispersonal(::AbstractVehicle)` with a where clause, we provide a default implementation for any subtype of `AbstractVehicle` that is not specifically handled.","status":200,"tokens":[146,236],"elapsed":3.202022625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
