All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Answer\n\nYou can define the `ispersonal` function as follows:\n\n```julia\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::Type{<:AbstractVehicle})\n    if vehicle == Car || vehicle == Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif vehicle == Bus || vehicle == Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\n\nHere's an example of how you can use the `ispersonal` function:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nprintln(ispersonal(Car))        # Output: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle)) # Output: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus))        # Output: false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck))      # Output: false\n```\n\nPlease note that the function `ispersonal` takes the type of the vehicle as an argument, rather than an instance of the vehicle itself. This is because you only need to check the type to determine whether it is a personal vehicle or not.","status":200,"tokens":[134,227],"elapsed":4.289022958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
