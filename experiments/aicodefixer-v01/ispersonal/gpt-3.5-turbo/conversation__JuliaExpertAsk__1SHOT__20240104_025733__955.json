All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

If it matches either type, the function returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[134,184],"elapsed":4.010579209,"_type":"aimessage"}]
