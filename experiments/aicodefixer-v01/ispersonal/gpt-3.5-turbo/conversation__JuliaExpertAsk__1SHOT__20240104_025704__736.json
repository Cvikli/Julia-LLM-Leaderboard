All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Answer\n\nHere's an implementation of the `ispersonal` function:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(v::AbstractVehicle) = isa(v, Car) || isa(v, Motorcycle)\n\n```\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\ncar = Car()\nmotorcycle = Motorcycle()\nbus = Bus()\ntruck = Truck()\n\nprintln(ispersonal(car))  # true\nprintln(ispersonal(motorcycle))  # true\nprintln(ispersonal(bus))  # false\nprintln(ispersonal(truck))  # false\n```\n\nIn this example, we define four different types of vehicles: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, and Truck, all of which are subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`. The `ispersonal` function checks if the given vehicle is either a `Car` or a `Motorcycle` by using the `isa` function and returns `true` if it is personal, and `false` otherwise.","status":200,"tokens":[134,217],"elapsed":4.037775083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
