All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Answer\n\nHere's the implementation of the `ispersonal` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::Type{T}) where {T <: AbstractVehicle}\n    if T === Car || T === Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T === Bus || T === Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nprintln(ispersonal(Car))  # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle))  # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus))  # false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck))  # false\n```\n\nNote: In the example above, I assumed that the Vehicle types are defined as custom struct types. You can modify the implementation to match your specific type definitions if needed.","status":200,"tokens":[134,195],"elapsed":4.248055417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
