The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The `ispersonal` function checks if the given vehicle is either a `Car` or a `Motorcycle` by using the `isa` function and returns `true` if it is personal, and `false` otherwise.","status":200,"tokens":[134,217],"elapsed":4.037775083,"_type":"aimessage"},{"content":"### Execution Results\n\n```plaintext\nExecution has been successful (no errors detected).
