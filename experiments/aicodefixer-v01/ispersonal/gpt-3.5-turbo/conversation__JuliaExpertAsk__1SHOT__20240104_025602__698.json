The `ispersonal` function takes an `AbstractVehicle` as input and returns `true` if the vehicle is either a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`, and `false` otherwise. It uses the `isa` keyword to check if the provided vehicle object is of the specified subtype.","status":200,"tokens":[134,179],"elapsed":3.665571625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
