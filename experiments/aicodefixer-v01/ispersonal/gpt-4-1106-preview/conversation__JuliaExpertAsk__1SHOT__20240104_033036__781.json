All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The example shows us calling the function with different vehicle subtypes and printing the corresponding output.","status":200,"tokens":[134,254],"elapsed":23.424975917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
