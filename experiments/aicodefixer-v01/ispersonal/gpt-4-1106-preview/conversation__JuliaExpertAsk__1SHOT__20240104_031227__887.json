All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Below is the `isPersonal` function implementing the described behavior:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nisPersonal(::Type{Car}) = true\nisPersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = true\nisPersonal(::Type{Bus}) = false\nisPersonal(::Type{Truck}) = false\nisPersonal(::Type{<:AbstractVehicle}) = false  # default case for other AbstractVehicle subtypes\n\n# Example usage:\nis_personal_car = isPersonal(Car)\nis_personal_motorcycle = isPersonal(Motorcycle)\nis_personal_bus = isPersonal(Bus)\nis_personal_truck = isPersonal(Truck)\nprintln(\"Is Car personal? $is_personal_car\")\nprintln(\"Is Motorcycle personal? $is_personal_motorcycle\")\nprintln(\"Is Bus personal? $is_personal_bus\")\nprintln(\"Is Truck personal? $is_personal_truck\")\n```\n\nThis code defines an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and four concrete subtypes `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. The `isPersonal` function checks the type of the vehicle and returns `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle`, `false` for `Bus` and `Truck`, and defaults to `false` for any other subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function for each vehicle type.","status":200,"tokens":[134,308],"elapsed":32.941060709,"_type":"aimessage"}]
