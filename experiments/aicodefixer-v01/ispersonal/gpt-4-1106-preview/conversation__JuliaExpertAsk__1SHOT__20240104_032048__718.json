The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the implementation of the `ispersonal` function:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Bus}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{Truck}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{T}) where T <: AbstractVehicle = false\n\n# Example usage:\nvehicle_type = Car\nprintln(ispersonal(vehicle_type)) # Output: true\n```\n\nThis function works with types rather than instances. To use it with instances, you would need to modify the function to accept instances and use the `typeof()` function to get the type within the `ispersonal` function.","status":200,"tokens":[134,172],"elapsed":13.539831167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
