You can run Julia with multiple threads by setting the environmental variable `JULIA_NUM_THREADS`. For example:\n\n```bash\nexport JULIA_NUM_THREADS=4\njulia\n```\n\nor you can start Julia with the `-t` or `--threads` command-line options:\n\n```bash\njulia --threads auto\n```\n\nThis enables automatic detection of the number of available cores.","status":200,"tokens":[97,454],"elapsed":36.437719208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
