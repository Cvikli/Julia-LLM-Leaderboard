It utilizes threads to perform each transformation in parallel.\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction to_pig_latin(word::String)\n    vowels = \"aeiou\"\n    if occursin(r\"^[aeiouAEIOU]\", word)\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        for (index, char) in enumerate(word)\n            if occursin(char, vowels)\n                return word[index:end] * word[1:index-1] * \"ay\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return word\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    pig_latin_words = Array{String}(undef, length(words))\n    @threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        pig_latin_words[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    return pig_latin_words\nend\n```\n\nMake sure you have more than one thread available for the threading to actually be parallel. You can set the number of threads by starting julia with the environment variable `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` or by setting it in Julia code before starting any operations with `Threads.nthreads()`. Example to start Julia with 4 threads:\n\n```bash\nexport JULIA_NUM_THREADS=4\njulia\n```\n\nOr in Julia:\n\n```julia\nThreads.nthreads(4)  # this must be done at startup, before any parallel operations\n```\n\nNote that word transformation in Pig Latin follows these basic rules:\n\n1. If the word begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u), append \"way\" to the end of the word.\n2. If the word begins with a consonant or consonant cluster (a sequence of consonants), move it to the end of the word, and then append \"ay\" to the end.\n\nThe function omits handling punctuation, capitalization, or words without vowels, which you could add based on your requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[97,424],"elapsed":24.219112542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
