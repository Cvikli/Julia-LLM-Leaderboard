It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is a Julia function `pig_latinify` that takes a vector of strings and returns a vector of strings transformed into Pig Latin. The function uses threads to process each string in parallel. To use this function, make sure your Julia environment has been started with multiple threads.\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction to_pig_latin(word::String)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    if first(word) in vowels\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        for i in eachindex(word)\n            if word[i] in vowels\n                return word[i:end] * word[1:i-1] * \"ay\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return word * \"ay\"\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    pig_latin_words = similar(words)\n\n    @threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        pig_latin_words[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n\n    return pig_latin_words\nend\n```\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `pig_latinify` function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"this\", \"is\", \"julia\"]\npig_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(pig_words)\n```\n\nMake sure that Julia is started with multiple threads. You can do this by setting the `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` environment variable before starting Julia, or by using the `-t` or `--threads` command-line option, e.g., `julia -t 4` for 4 threads.","status":200,"tokens":[97,340],"elapsed":21.859395708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
