For example, you can do this by setting the environment variable before running Julia:\n\n```bash\nexport JULIA_NUM_THREADS=4\n```\n\nAlternately, you can use the `-t` or `--threads` command line option when starting Julia:\n\n```bash\njulia --threads 4\n```\n\nAfterwards, you can call the function `pig_latinify` with a vector of strings:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"this\", \"is\", \"julia\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(pig_latin_words)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[97,380],"elapsed":29.243757042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
