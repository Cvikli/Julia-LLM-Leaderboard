The following Julia code defines a function `pig_latinify` that takes a vector of strings and converts each string to Pig Latin using multi-threading. It uses the `Threads.@spawn` macro to perform each conversion on a separate thread.\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    function to_pig_latin(word::String)\n        if startswith(word, r\"^[aeiouAEIOU]\")\n            return word * \"way\"\n        else\n            first_vowel_indx = findfirst(match(r\"[aeiouAEIOU]\", word))\n            if isnothing(first_vowel_indx)\n                return word\n            else\n                return word[first_vowel_indx:end] * word[1:first_vowel_indx-1] * \"ay\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    tasks = [Threads.@spawn to_pig_latin(word) for word in words]\n    return [fetch(task) for task in tasks]\nend\n```\n\nThis function creates a task for each word using list comprehension and `Threads.@spawn`. Once all tasks are spawned, it fetches the results from each task using `fetch`.\n\nPlease ensure threading is enabled in your Julia session. You can typically enable threading by setting the `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` environment variable before starting Julia, for example, by using `export JULIA_NUM_THREADS=4` on Unix-based systems or by including it in your session as follows:\n```julia\nENV[\"JULIA_NUM_THREADS\"] = \"4\"\n```\n\nAnd then you can test the `pig_latinify` function like this:\n```julia\njulia> pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\", \"school\"])\n```","status":200,"tokens":[97,359],"elapsed":35.880404834,"_type":"aimessage"}]
