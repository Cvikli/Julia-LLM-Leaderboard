Next, `pig_latinify` takes a vector of words and transforms each word concurrently, each in a separate thread, and returns the transformed vector. The `@sync` macro ensures that the main thread waits for all the `@spawn` tasks (child threads) to complete before returning the result. \n\nPlease ensure that you have a multi-threaded environment before using this function, as threading is dependent on the number of cores and how Julia was started. You can start Julia with multiple threads by setting the `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` environment variable or by using the `-t` or `--threads` command-line option.","status":200,"tokens":[97,351],"elapsed":29.290782083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
