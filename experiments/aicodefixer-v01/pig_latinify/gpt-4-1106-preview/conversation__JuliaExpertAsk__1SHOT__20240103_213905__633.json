The `pig_latinify` function copies the original vector of strings and then creates threads for each word conversion using a for loop combined with `@sync` and `@spawn`. The `@sync` macro ensures that all spawned tasks are completed before the function returns the transformed vector.\n\nUse the `pig_latinify` function like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\", \"programming\", \"multithreaded\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(pig_latin_words)\n```\n\nRemember that to use multi-threading, you should have Julia started with the appropriate number of threads, which you can set by the environment variable `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` or within Julia by setting the `-t` / `--threads` command line option.","status":200,"tokens":[97,395],"elapsed":35.223487958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
