Below is the implementation of a `pig_latinify` function in Julia that processes each string in a vector on a separate thread using multi-threading features provided by the `Threads` stdlib.\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latin(word::String)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    if first(word) in vowels\n        return word * \"yay\"\n    else\n        for i in 1:length(word)\n            if word[i] in vowels\n                return word[i:end] * word[1:i-1] * \"ay\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    # In case there are no vowels, which is untypical for English words\n    return word\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    threads_output = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    # Perform computation on separate threads\n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        threads_output[i] = pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    threads_output\nend\n\n# Make sure you've initialized multiple threads\n# You can start Julia with multiple threads by setting the environment variable like so:\n# ENV[\"JULIA_NUM_THREADS\"] = 4\n\nwords = [\"thread\", \"transformation\", \"example\", \"julia\", \"pig\", \"latin\"]\ntransformed_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(transformed_words)  # Output should be in Pig Latin\n```\n\nRemember to start Julia with multiple threads to make use of the parallel processing. You can do this by setting an environment variable (`JULIA_NUM_THREADS`) before starting Julia, or by adding `-t` or `--threads` followed by the number of threads when starting Julia from the command line.\n\nPlease make sure that you are using Julia version 1.3 or newer, as the use of `Threads.@threads` requires the newer multi-threading capabilities introduced in Julia 1.3.","status":200,"tokens":[97,413],"elapsed":43.565122792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
