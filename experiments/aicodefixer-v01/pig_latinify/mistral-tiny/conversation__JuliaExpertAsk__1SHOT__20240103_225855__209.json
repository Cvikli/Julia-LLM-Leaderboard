Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To create a pig Latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings using multiple threads, you can utilize Julia's `Threads` module. Here's a brief and concise solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(str::String)\n    words = split(str, \" \")\n    pig_latin_words = map(word -> transform_word(word), words)\n    join(pig_latin_words, \" \")\nend\n\nfunction transform_word(word::AbstractString)\n    if startswith(word, \"qu\")\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    end\n\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    if islowercase(first_letter)\n        first_letter = uppercase(first_letter)\n    end\n\n    i = 2\n    while i <= length(word)\n        if word[i] âˆˆ 'aeiou'\n            return string(word[i:end], first_letter, \"ay\")\n        end\n        i += 1\n    end\n\n    return string(word[2:end], first_letter, \"ay\")\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_transform(strings::Vector{String})\n    threads = Threads.Vector{Threads.Thread}(length(strings))\n\n    for (i, str) in enumerate(strings)\n        push!(threads, Threads.@spawn pig_latinify(str))\n    end\n\n    results = [Threads.wait(threads)[i] for i in 1:length(threads)]\n    results\nend\n```\n\nUsing `pig_latin_transform` function, you can transform a vector of strings into pig Latin using multiple threads. Make sure to install the latest Julia version to use the `Threads` module.","status":200,"tokens":[107,424],"elapsed":5.882389667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
