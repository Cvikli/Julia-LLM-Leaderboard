It uses the `Threads.jl` library to perform each string transformation in a separate thread. The `pig_latinify` function initializes an empty vector `results` to store the results of each thread. It then iterates through each string in the input vector and starts a new thread for each string. The threads are stored in an array `threads`. After all threads are started, the function waits for each thread to finish and then adds its result to the `results` vector. The final output is the `results` vector containing the pig latin transformed strings.","status":200,"tokens":[107,393],"elapsed":3.398493041,"_type":"aimessage"},{"content":"### Execution Results\n\n```plaintext\n**Parsing Error Detected:** Base.Meta.ParseError(\"ParseError:\\n# Error @ none:8:83\\n    consonants = [\\\"b\\\", \\\"c\\\", \\\"d\\\", \\\"f\\\", \\\"g\\\", \\\"h\\\", \\\"j\\\", \\\"k\\\", \\\"l\\\", \\\"m\\\", \\\"n\\\", \\\"p\\\", \\\"q\\\", \\\"r\\\", \\\"s\\\", \\\"t\\\", \\\"v\\\", \\\"w\\\", \\\"x\\\", \\\"y\\\", \\\"z\\\"]\\n    initial_cluster = first_letter ∉ consonants ?

Changed `Threads.wait(thread)` to `Threads.reduce(Threads.@spawnat(Threads.current(), pig_latinify, thread.result), vcat)`. `Threads.reduce` is used to collect the results of the threads.\n2. Added `using Reexport` at the beginning of the file to be able to use the `@threaded` macro.\n\nThis version of the code should work as intended.
