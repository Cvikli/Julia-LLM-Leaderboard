For each thread, it defines a helper function `pig_latin_threaded` that converts the given string to pig latin and returns the desired result. The main function `pig_latinify` initializes the threads, converts the strings in each thread, and collects the results back into a vector.","status":200,"tokens":[107,354],"elapsed":3.110103416,"_type":"aimessage"}]
