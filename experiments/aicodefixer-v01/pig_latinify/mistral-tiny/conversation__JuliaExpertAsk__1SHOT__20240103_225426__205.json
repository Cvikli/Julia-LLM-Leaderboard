Here's an example of how to achieve that:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    function pig_latin_transform(str::String)\n        first_letter = lowercase(str[1])\n        consonants = [\"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"f\", \"g\", \"h\", \"j\", \"k\", \"l\", \"m\", \"n\", \"p\", \"q\", \"r\", \"s\", \"t\", \"v\", \"w\", \"x\", \"y\", \"z\"]\n        index = findfirst(x -> x âˆˆ consonants, collect(Iterators.drop(eachindex(str), 1)))\n\n        if isnothing(index)\n            return str * \"way\"\n        else\n            return string(str[index:end]) * string(str[1:index-1]) * first_letter * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    threads = Array{Thread}(length(strings))\n    results = Vector{String}(length(strings))\n\n    for (i, thread_result) in enumerate(zip(threads, results))\n        push!(threads, Thread(pig_latin_transform, strings[i]))\n        thread_result[] = \"\"\n        wait(threads[i])\n        results[i] = threads[i].stack_empty.data\n    end\n\n    return results\nend\n```\n\nThis `pig_latinify` function accepts a vector of strings and uses a helper function `pig_latin_transform` to transform each string into pig latin format. It creates and starts a separate thread for each string in the vector, and collects the results back into a vector when all threads have finished their work.\n\nPlease note that this implementation may not be the most efficient way to perform the pig latin transformation using multithreading, but it demonstrates the use of multiple threads to process a vector of strings concurrently.","status":200,"tokens":[107,492],"elapsed":4.21098425,"_type":"aimessage"}]
