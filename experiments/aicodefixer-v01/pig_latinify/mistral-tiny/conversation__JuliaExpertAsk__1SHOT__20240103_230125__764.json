Here's a solution:\n\nFirst, let's define the pig latin function `pig_latin`:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latin(str::AbstractString)\n    first_letter = lowercase(str[1])\n    consonants = [\"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"f\", \"g\", \"h\", \"j\", \"k\", \"l\", \"m\", \"n\", \"p\", \"q\", \"r\", \"s\", \"t\", \"v\", \"w\", \"x\", \"y\", \"z\"]\n    index = findfirst(x -> x == first_letter, consonants)\n    if isnan(index)\n        return string(\"aya\", str[index+1:end]) * string(first_letter)\n    else\n        return string(str[index+1:end]) * string(\"aya\", str[1:index])\n    end\nend\n```\n\nNow, let's define the `pig_latinify` function that makes use of the Julia Multithreading `Threads.jl` package:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strs::Vector{AbstractString})\n    threads = Vector{Thread}()\n\n    for str in strs\n        push!(threads, Thread(pig_latin_worker, str))\n    end\n\n    wait(threads)\n\n    transformed_strs = Vector{AbstractString}()\n    for thread in threads\n        push!(transformed_strs, thread.result)\n    end\n\n    transformed_strs\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_worker(str::AbstractString)\n    transformed_str = pig_latin(str)\n    return transformed_str\nend\n```\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function accepts a vector of strings, and for each string, it creates a thread and starts the `pig_latin_worker` function in that thread. Once all threads are done, it collects the results and returns a vector containing the pig latin transformed strings.","status":200,"tokens":[107,519],"elapsed":4.454654625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
