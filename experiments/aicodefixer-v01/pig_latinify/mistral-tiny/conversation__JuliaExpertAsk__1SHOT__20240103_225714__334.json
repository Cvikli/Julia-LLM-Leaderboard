The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as an argument, creates a thread for each string, and gathers the results in a new vector.\n\nKeep in mind that P Pool is deprecated in Julia 1.7, and you should use the new parallel dispatch library instead. To use the new library, replace the `Threads` import with ` parallel`, and replace the `Thread` type with `ThreadPool`, and change the line `threads = Vector{Thread}(undef, length(strings))` to `threads = ThreadPool(length(strings))`. Also, instead of `wait(thread)`, use `fetch(threads[i])`.\n\nThis way, you can parallelize the pig latin transformation of strings efficiently.","status":200,"tokens":[107,503],"elapsed":4.55679075,"_type":"aimessage"}]
