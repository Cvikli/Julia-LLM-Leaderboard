The request asks for a `pig_latinify` function that operates on a vector of strings in parallel using separate threads. However, the code provided does not define a `pig_latinify` function that can be used in parallel. Instead, it defines a `pig_latin_threaded` function that creates a thread for each string and returns the results in parallel.\n\n1. The error occurred because the `Threads` module was not imported in the code. The error message says \"UndefVarError: :Thread\", which indicates that the `Thread` type was not defined.\n\n2. To improve the code, first define the `pig_latinify` function as a pure function that operates on a single string in parallel.
