The `pig_latinify_threaded` function takes a Vector{String} as an argument and applies the Pig Latin transformation to each element using threads for parallel execution.\n\nKeep in mind that this example does not include error handling or input validation, but it should give you a good starting point.","status":200,"tokens":[107,319],"elapsed":12.032348834,"_type":"aimessage"}]
