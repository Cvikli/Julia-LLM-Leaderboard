The `pig_latinify` function initializes an empty vector to store the transformed strings, then uses the `@threads` macro to iterate over each input string. Within the loop, the `pig_latinify_string` function is called to transform the string to pig latin, and the result is stored in the corresponding index of the output vector.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_string` function splits the input string into words, then maps the `pig_latinify_word` function over each word to transform it to pig latin. The transformed words are then concatenated with spaces to form the final pig latin string.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_word` function checks if the word starts with a vowel. If it does, it appends `\"ay\"` to the end of the word. If the word starts with a consonant, it finds the index of the first occurrence of a lowercase vowel in the word (if any) and moves the consonant cluster to the end of the word, followed by `\"ay\"`.\n\nNote: The `@threads` macro requires Julia to be built with multi-threading enabled.","status":200,"tokens":[97,481],"elapsed":8.030495084,"_type":"aimessage"}]
