It uses the `@threads` macro from the `Threads` module to parallelize the computations. Each string is transformed to pig latin using the `pig_latinify_string` function.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_string` function splits the string into words, transforms each word to pig latin using the `pig_latinify_word` function, and then joins the pig latin words back into a single string.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_word` function checks if the word starts with a vowel. If it does, it simply adds \"way\" to the end of the word. If it starts with a consonant, it finds the first vowel in the word and moves everything before that vowel to the end, followed by \"ay\".\n\nNote that the `@threads` macro will attempt to parallelize the iterations across multiple threads, but the effectiveness of parallelization depends on the number of available threads and the size of the input vector. Be sure to adjust the number of threads and evaluate the performance to achieve the best results for your specific use case.","status":200,"tokens":[97,460],"elapsed":7.39003025,"_type":"aimessage"}]
