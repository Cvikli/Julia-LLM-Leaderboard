The `pig_latin` function performs the actual transformation of an individual word.\n\nPlease note that parallelization in Julia can have different performance characteristics depending on the computational task and hardware setup.

While it parallelizes the execution of the `pig_latin` function by using `@threads`, it does not provide separate threads for each iteration over the input vector of strings. Instead, it parallelizes the execution across iterations using thread-level parallelism.\n\n2. The execution results show no errors, which indicates that the code implementation is syntactically correct and runs without any issues. However, it does not fulfill the requirement of running each iteration on a separate thread.\n\n3. Improvements to the code can be made as follows:\n\n- Instead of using the `@threads` macro, we can create and manage separate threads explicitly to ensure that each iteration operates on a separate thread.\n- To achieve parallel execution, we can make use of Julia's `@spawn` macro to spawn a new task (which runs on a separate thread) for each iteration over the input vector.\n\nHere is an improved implementation that takes these improvements into account:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    transformed_strings = Vector{String}(undef, length(strings))\n    tasks = Task[length(strings)]\n    for i in eachindex(strings)\n        tasks[i] = @spawn pig_latin(strings[i])\n    end\n    for i in eachindex(strings)\n        transformed_strings[i] = fetch(tasks[i])\n    end\n    return transformed_strings\nend\n```\n\nPlease note that explicit management of threads and tasks may have different performance characteristics depending on the hardware setup and available resources.
