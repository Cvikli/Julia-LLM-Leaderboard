It creates an empty vector of strings called `transformed_words` with the same length as the input `words` vector.\n\nUsing `Threads.@threads`, I iterate over each index `i` in parallel and assign the pig latin transformation of the corresponding word in `words` to `transformed_words[i]`.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_word` function takes a word as input and applies the pig latin transformation to it. It determines the position of the first vowel in the word, and then constructs the pig latin transformation accordingly. If the word starts with a vowel, it simply appends \"ay\" to the end of the word. Otherwise, it moves the consonants before the first vowel to the end of the word and appends \"ay\" as well.\n\nThe `isvowel` function checks if a given character is a vowel by converting it to lowercase and checking if it is in the set of vowels.","status":200,"tokens":[97,418],"elapsed":7.444439041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
