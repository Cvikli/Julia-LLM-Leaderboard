The `pig_latinify` function creates a vector `output` to store the transformed strings. It then creates an array of spawned threads, one for each input string. Each thread calls the `pig_latinify_word` function to transform its corresponding string and assigns the result to the `output` vector. Finally, the function waits for all threads to complete using `Threads.wait`, and returns the `output` vector of transformed strings.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_word` function takes a single word as input and applies the pig latin transformation. It first checks if the word starts with a vowel. If it does, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word. Otherwise, it finds the index of the first vowel using `findfirst` and rearranges the word accordingly.\n\nPlease note that threading may not always provide a performance improvement, depending on the specific use case. It is recommended to test the code on the actual workload to see if threading provides any benefit.","status":200,"tokens":[97,391],"elapsed":12.619776833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
