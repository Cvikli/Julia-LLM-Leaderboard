It also creates a vector, `threads`, to store the thread objects.\n\nThen, for each string in the input vector, a new thread is spawned using `Threads.@spawn`. Each thread calls the `pig_latinify_single` function to transform the individual string to pig latin, and stores the result in the corresponding index of `result`.\n\nAfter all the threads have been spawned, the function waits for them to finish using `Threads.join`.\n\nFinally, the `result` vector is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[97,364],"elapsed":6.568475417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
