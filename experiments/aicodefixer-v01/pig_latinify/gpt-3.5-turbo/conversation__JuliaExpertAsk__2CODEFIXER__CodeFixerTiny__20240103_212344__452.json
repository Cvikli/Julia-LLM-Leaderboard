Each iteration checks if the first character of the word is a vowel or a consonant and transforms the word accordingly. The result vector is filled in parallel and returned.","status":200,"tokens":[97,206],"elapsed":3.108269375,"_type":"aimessage"},{"content":"### Execution Results\n\n```plaintext\n**Error Detected:** LoadError(\"none\", 8, UndefVarError(Symbol(\"@thread\")))\n```\n\nTake a deep break.

The `@thread` macro is replaced with the `@spawn` macro to create a thread for each iteration. The result vector is initialized with `undef`, and each thread assigns its result to the corresponding index in the result vector. After all threads have been spawned, we use a `for` loop to fetch all the results from the threads. The fixed implementation should now work without any errors.","status":200,"tokens":[378,242],"elapsed":4.446994917,"_type":"aimessage"},{"content":"### Execution Results\n\n```plaintext\nExecution has been successful (no errors detected).
