The function uses the `@threads` macro from `Base.Threads` to parallelize the loop, with each iteration running on a separate thread. Within each iteration, the `pig_latinify_string` function is called to transform the current string to pig latin.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_string` function takes a string as input and splits it into individual words. Each word is then transformed to pig latin by checking if the first letter is a vowel or not. If it is a vowel, \"way\" is appended to the word. Otherwise, the first letter is moved to the end of the word and \"ay\" is appended. The resulting pig latin words are joined back together with spaces to form the final pig latin string.\n\nThe `is_vowel` function is a helper function that checks whether a given character is a vowel. It returns `true` if the character is 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u', and `false` otherwise.","status":200,"tokens":[97,466],"elapsed":8.074944834,"_type":"aimessage"}]
