The `pig_latinify_string` function splits the string into words, applies the `pig_latinify_word` function to each word, and then joins the transformed words back into a single string. \n\nThe `pig_latinify_word` function checks whether the word starts with a vowel. If it does, it appends \"way\" to the word. If not, it finds the index of the first vowel and rearranges the word accordingly before appending \"ay\" to the end.\n\nPlease note that the code assumes the string is space-separated words and does not handle cases involving punctuation or extra spaces.","status":200,"tokens":[97,398],"elapsed":6.548333375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
