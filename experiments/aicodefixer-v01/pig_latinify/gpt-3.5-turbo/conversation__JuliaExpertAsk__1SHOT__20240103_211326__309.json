Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you can implement the `pig_latinify` function using multiple threads in Julia using the `Threads.@threads` macro:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(strings))\n    \n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(strings)\n        words = split(strings[i])\n        pig_latin = []\n        for word in words\n            if occursin(Regex(\"[aeiou]\"), word)\n                pig_latin_word = word * \"ay\"\n            else\n                first_vowel = search(Regex(\"[aeiou]\"), word)\n                pig_latin_word = word[first_vowel:end] * word[1:first_vowel-1] * \"ay\"\n            end\n            push!(pig_latin, pig_latin_word)\n        end\n        result[i] = join(pig_latin, \" \")\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\n\nNote that the `Threads.@threads` macro enables parallel execution of the loop. The `result` vector is pre-allocated outside the loop to avoid race conditions. Also, make sure that the Julia installation you're using supports multi-threading (check with `Threads.nthreads()`).","status":200,"tokens":[97,257],"elapsed":4.91177275,"_type":"aimessage"}]
