It initializes a `transformed_words` array to store the transformed words. The `@threads` macro is used to parallelize the loop over the input words. Inside the loop, each word is transformed using the `pig_latinify_word` function. The transformed word is then stored in the `transformed_words` array. Finally, the `transformed_words` array is returned.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_word` function takes in a single word and transforms it to pig latin. It checks if the first character of the word is a vowel. If it is, then \"way\" is appended to the word. If the first character is a consonant, the function splits the word into consonants and the rest, and then appends the appropriate suffix to form the pig latin word.\n\nNote that you need to activate multi-threading in Julia by setting the `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` environment variable to the desired number of threads before running the code.","status":200,"tokens":[97,367],"elapsed":10.644670583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
