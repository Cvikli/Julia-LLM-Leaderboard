Each string in the vector will be transformed to pig latin using multiple threads. The function `pig_latinify_word` is a helper function that performs the pig latin transformation on a single word. It checks if the word starts with a vowel and appends \"ay\" to the end. If not, it finds the first vowel in the word and moves the consonants before it to the end of the word, followed by \"ay\". The transformed strings are stored in a separate vector and returned as the result.","status":200,"tokens":[97,303],"elapsed":5.367670625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
