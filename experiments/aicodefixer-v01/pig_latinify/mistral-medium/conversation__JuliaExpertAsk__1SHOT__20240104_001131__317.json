The `pig_latinify` function then iterates over the input strings using the `Threads.@threads` macro to apply the `pig_latin_transform` function in separate threads. Finally, the function returns the transformed strings as a vector.\n\nNote that the order of the output strings may not match the order of the input strings due to the concurrent execution of the threads. If the order is important, you can use a thread-safe data structure such as a `Channel` to collect the results in order.","status":200,"tokens":[107,513],"elapsed":15.542566792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
