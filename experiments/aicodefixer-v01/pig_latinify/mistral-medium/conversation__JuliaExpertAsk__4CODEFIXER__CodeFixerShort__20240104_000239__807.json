Note that the indexing `word[1:first_vowel_index-1]` assumes that `first_vowel_index` is greater than 1. If you want to handle the edge case where the first character is a vowel and the word is only one character long, you may need to add additional checks.\n\nKeep in mind that multithreading in Julia requires proper handling of synchronization and memory access, especially when working with shared mutable state. In this example, the `@spawn` macro and the `fetch` function are used to create and manage threads and ensure that the results are properly collected and returned.","status":200,"tokens":[107,405],"elapsed":15.464626209,"_type":"aimessage"},{"content":"\nThe above Julia code has been executed with the following results:\n\n```plaintext\nExecution has been successful (no errors detected).
