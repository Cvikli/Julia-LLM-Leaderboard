Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a concise implementation of a pig latin transformer in Julia. It defines a `pig_latinify` function that operates on a vector of strings, using multithreading to perform the transformation for each string concurrently.\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\nfunction pig_latinify(input_strings)\n    pig_latin_transform(s) = begin\n        words = split(s)\n        pig_words = [begin\n            word = lowercase(w)\n            if word[1] âˆˆ ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n                word * \"way\"\n            else\n                word[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\"\n            end\n        end for w in words]\n        join(pig_words, \" \")\n    end\n\n    @sync begin\n        for (i, s) in enumerate(input_strings)\n            @async begin\n                input_strings[i] = pig_latin_transform(s)\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    input_strings\nend\n```\n\nThis implementation first defines a helper function `pig_latin_transform` to convert a single string to pig latin. Then, the `pig_latinify` function applies this transformation to each string in the input vector, running each iteration on a separate thread using `@async`. The `@sync` macro ensures that the main thread waits for all the asynchronous tasks to complete before returning the transformed vector.\n\nConfidence: 95%","status":200,"tokens":[107,352],"elapsed":7.807746417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
