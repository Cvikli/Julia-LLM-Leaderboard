Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of a pig latin transformer function called `pig_latinify` in Julia. This function uses the `@threads` macro to apply the transformation to each string in the input vector concurrently.\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(input::Vector{String})\n    output = Vector{String}(undef, length(input))\n    @threads for (i, word) in enumerate(input)\n        if startswith(word, [\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"])\n            output[i] = word * \"way\"\n        else\n            first_consonant_index = findfirst(!isvowel, word)\n            output[i] = word[first_consonant_index:end] * word[1:first_consonant_index-1] * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n    return output\nend\n\nfunction isvowel(c::Char)\n    return c âˆˆ ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\nend\n```\nThe `isvowel` function is used to check if a character is a vowel. The `pig_latinify` function first initializes an output vector of the same length as the input. It then iterates over each word in the input vector and applies the pig latin transformation. The transformation consists of two cases:\n\n1. If the word starts with a vowel, it is simply appended with \"way\".\n2. If the word starts with a consonant, the first consonant cluster is moved to the end of the word and \"ay\" is appended.\n\nNote that the implementation assumes that the input words are lowercase. If the input can contain uppercase letters, you may need to modify the code to handle them. Additionally, this implementation may not correctly handle words with punctuation or digits. You may need to modify the code to handle such cases if necessary.","status":200,"tokens":[107,433],"elapsed":22.009259458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
