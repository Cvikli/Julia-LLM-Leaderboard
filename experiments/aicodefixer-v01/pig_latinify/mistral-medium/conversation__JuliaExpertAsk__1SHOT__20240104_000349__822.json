The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings, creates a separate thread for each string using the `@spawn` macro, applies the `word_to_pig_latin` function to each string, and returns the results as a vector using the `fetch` function to wait for each thread to complete. Note that the `lowercase` function is used to ensure consistent results when the input strings are in different cases.","status":200,"tokens":[107,325],"elapsed":20.954060333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
