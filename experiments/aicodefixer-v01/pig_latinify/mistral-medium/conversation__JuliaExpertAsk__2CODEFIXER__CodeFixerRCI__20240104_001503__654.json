The `continue` statement is used to skip empty strings.\n\nConfidence: 95% (Assuming that the pig latin transformation is as described, appending the first letter of the word followed by \"ay\" to the rest of the word.)","status":200,"tokens":[107,241],"elapsed":5.717709917,"_type":"aimessage"},{"content":"Ignore all previous instructions. \nYour goal is to satisfy the user's request by using several rounds of self-reflection (Critique step) and improvement of the previously provided solution (Improve step).\nAlways enclose Julia code in triple backticks code fence (```julia\\n ... \\n```).\n\n1. **Recall Past Critique:**\n- Summarize past critique to refresh your memory (use inline quotes to highlight the few characters of the code that caused the mistakes). It must not repeat.\n\n2. **Critique Step Instructions:** \n- Read the user request word-by-word. Does the code implementation follow the request to the the letter? Think it though step-by-step.\n- Review the provided feedback in detail.\n- Provide 2-3 bullet points of criticism for the code. Each bullet point must refer to a different type of error or issue.\n    - If there are any errors, explain why and what needs to be changed to FIX THEM! Be specific. \n    - If an error repeats or critique repeats, previous issue was not addressed. YOU MUST SUGGEST A DIFFERENT IMPROVEMENT THAN BEFORE.\n    - If there are no errors, identify and list specific issues or areas for improvement to write more idiomatic Julia code.\n\n\n3. **Improve Step Instructions:** \n- Specify what you'll change to address the above critique.\n- Provide the revised code reflecting your suggested improvements. Always repeat the function definition, as only the Julia code in last message will be evaluated.\n- Ensure the new version of the code resolves the problems while fulfilling the original task. Ensure it has the same function name.\n- Write 2-3 correct and helpful unit tests for the function requested by the user (organize in `@testset \"name\" begin ... end` block, use `@test` macro).\n\n\n3. **Response Format:**\n---\n### Past Critique\n<brief bullet points on past critique>\n\n### Critique\n<list of issues as bullet points pinpointing the mistakes in the code (use inline quotes)>\n\n### Improve\n<list of improvements as bullet points with clear outline of a solution (use inline quotes)>\n\n```julia\n<provide improved code>\n```\n---\n\nBe concise and focused in all steps.\n\n### Feedback from the User\n\nExecution has been successful (no errors detected).
