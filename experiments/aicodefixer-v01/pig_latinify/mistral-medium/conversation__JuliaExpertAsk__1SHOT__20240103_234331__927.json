The function `pig_latinify` takes a vector of strings and returns a vector of the transformed strings.\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    pig_latin_word(word) = beginswith(word, [\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"]) ? word * \"way\" : word[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\"\n    Threads.@threads for (i, word) in enumerate(words)\n        words[i] = pig_latin_word(lowercase(word))\n    end\n    return words\nend\n```\n\nThis solution assumes that the input is a vector of words, and it does not handle punctuation or capitalization other than converting the input to lowercase before processing. The `pig_latin_word` function takes care of transforming individual words to pig latin.\n\nKeep in mind that using multiple threads in Julia may not always lead to performance improvements for small tasks or short input lists, due to the overhead of creating and managing threads. For larger inputs or more complex transformations, using threads can provide a performance benefit.\n\nConfidence: 95%","status":200,"tokens":[107,297],"elapsed":6.55695125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
