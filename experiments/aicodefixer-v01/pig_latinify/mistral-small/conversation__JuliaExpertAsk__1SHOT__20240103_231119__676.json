Note that this implementation assumes that the input vector `strings` does not contain any `nothing` values, as it uses the `enumerate` function to get both the index and the value of each string in the vector. If the input vector may contain `nothing` values, you should add error handling or pre-process the input vector to remove `nothing` values before passing it to this function.","status":200,"tokens":[107,330],"elapsed":4.517300166,"_type":"aimessage"}]
