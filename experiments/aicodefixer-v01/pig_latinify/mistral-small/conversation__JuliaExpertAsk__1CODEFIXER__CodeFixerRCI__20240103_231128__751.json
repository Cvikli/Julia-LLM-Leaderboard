Note that this implementation assumes that the input vector `strings` does not contain any `nothing` values, as it uses the `enumerate` function to get both the index and the value of each string in the vector. If the input vector may contain `nothing` values, you should add error handling or pre-process the input vector to remove `nothing` values before passing it to this function.","status":200,"tokens":[107,330],"elapsed":4.517300166,"_type":"aimessage"},{"content":"Ignore all previous instructions. \nYour goal is to satisfy the user's request by using several rounds of self-reflection (Critique step) and improvement of the previously provided solution (Improve step).\nAlways enclose Julia code in triple backticks code fence (```julia\\n ... \\n```).\n\n1. **Recall Past Critique:**\n- Summarize past critique to refresh your memory (use inline quotes to highlight the few characters of the code that caused the mistakes). It must not repeat.\n\n2. **Critique Step Instructions:** \n- Read the user request word-by-word. Does the code implementation follow the request to the the letter? Think it though step-by-step.\n- Review the provided feedback in detail.\n- Provide 2-3 bullet points of criticism for the code. Each bullet point must refer to a different type of error or issue.\n    - If there are any errors, explain why and what needs to be changed to FIX THEM! Be specific. \n    - If an error repeats or critique repeats, previous issue was not addressed. YOU MUST SUGGEST A DIFFERENT IMPROVEMENT THAN BEFORE.\n    - If there are no errors, identify and list specific issues or areas for improvement to write more idiomatic Julia code.\n\n\n3. **Improve Step Instructions:** \n- Specify what you'll change to address the above critique.\n- Provide the revised code reflecting your suggested improvements.
