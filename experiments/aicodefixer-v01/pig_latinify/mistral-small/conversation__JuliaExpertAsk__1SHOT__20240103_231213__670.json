The function first checks if the word is empty, in which case it leaves the word unchanged. If the word is not empty, it checks if the first letter is a vowel or a consonant, and applies the pig latin transformation accordingly (by moving the first letter to the end and appending \"ay\" or \"way\"). The function uses the `Threads.@threads` macro to parallelize the iteration over the input vector, so that each word is transformed in a separate thread.\n\nThe `isvowel` function checks if a character is a vowel or not. It returns `true` if the character is a lowercase or uppercase vowel, and `false` otherwise.","status":200,"tokens":[107,438],"elapsed":5.877249916,"_type":"aimessage"}]
