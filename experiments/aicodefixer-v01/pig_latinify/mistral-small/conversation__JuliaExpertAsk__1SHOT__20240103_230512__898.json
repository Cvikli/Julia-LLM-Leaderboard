It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a solution using Julia's `Threads.@threads` macro to parallelize the iteration over the vector of strings:\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strs::Vector{String})\n    result = similar(strs)\n\n    Threads.@threads for (i, str) in enumerate(strs)\n        if isempty(str)\n            result[i] = \"\"\n        else\n            head = str[1:min(length(str), 1)]\n            tail = str[2:end]\n            result[i] = tail * head * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n```\nThe `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as input and returns a new vector of strings where each string is transformed into pig latin. The function uses the `Threads.@threads` macro to create a separate thread for each string in the input vector. The `enumerate` function is used to get the index of the current string so that the result can be placed in the correct position in the output vector.\n\nThe pig latin transformation itself is done by taking the first letter of the string and moving it to the end, followed by adding \"ay\". If the input string is empty, the output string is also empty.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input vector is not modified during the execution of the function. If the input vector is modified, the behavior of the function is undefined.","status":200,"tokens":[107,332],"elapsed":25.56940775,"_type":"aimessage"}]
