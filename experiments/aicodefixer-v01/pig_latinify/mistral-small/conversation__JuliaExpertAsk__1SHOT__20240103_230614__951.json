It then iterates over each string `str` in `strs` in separate threads.\n\nIf the string is empty, it just copies the empty string to the `result` vector.\n\nFor non-empty strings, it finds the first vowel's index. If the string doesn't contain any vowels, it appends \"ay\" to the end. Otherwise, it splits the string into two parts: `prefix` (the part before the first vowel) and `suffix` (the rest of the string). The pig latin version is then constructed by concatenating `suffix`, an underscore, and `prefix`, followed by \"ay\".\n\nFinally, the function returns the `result` vector containing the pig latin transformations of the input strings.","status":200,"tokens":[107,438],"elapsed":32.42901325,"_type":"aimessage"}]
