If it is, the function just copies the word to the result vector. Otherwise, the function identifies the first vowel in the word. If the word doesn't contain any vowels, the function appends \"ay\" to the word. If the word contains vowels, the function separates the word into a prefix (everything before the first vowel) and a suffix (everything after the first vowel). Then, the function constructs the pig latin word by concatenating the suffix, an underscore, the prefix, and \"ay\".\n\nThe `Threads.@threads` macro handles the multithreading aspect of the problem. It automatically creates multiple threads and distributes the iterations among them. However, keep in mind that the actual performance gain depends on the number of available CPU cores and the size of the input vector. For small input vectors, the overhead of creating and managing threads might outweigh the benefits of parallelization.","status":200,"tokens":[107,484],"elapsed":6.543795458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
