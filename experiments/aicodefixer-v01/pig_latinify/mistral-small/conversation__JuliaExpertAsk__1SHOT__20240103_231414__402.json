Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a solution using Julia's `Threads.@threads` macro to perform the iteration in parallel:\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(str::Vector{String})\n    result = similar(str)\n\n    Threads.@threads for (i, word) in enumerate(str)\n        if isempty(word)\n            result[i] = word\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if all(islowercase, word)\n            prefix = word[1:end-2]\n            suffix = word[end-1:end]\n        else\n            prefix = word[1:end-3]\n            suffix = word[end-2:end]\n        end\n\n        result[i] = prefix * suffix * 'a' * 'y'\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n```\nThis function takes a vector of strings `str` and returns a new vector of strings with each word transformed into pig latin. The function uses the `Threads.@threads` macro to iterate over each word in parallel, which can improve performance for large input vectors.\n\nThe function first creates a new vector `result` with the same size as `str`. It then iterates over each word in `str`, checking for empty strings and applying the pig latin transformation. The transformation involves moving the first letter or two letters to the end of the word (depending on whether the word contains any uppercase letters), and appending \"ay\" to the end. The resulting word is then stored in the `result` vector.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input vector only contains words that are at least two letters long. If the input vector may contain shorter words, you should add additional error checking to handle those cases.","status":200,"tokens":[107,391],"elapsed":5.271961708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
