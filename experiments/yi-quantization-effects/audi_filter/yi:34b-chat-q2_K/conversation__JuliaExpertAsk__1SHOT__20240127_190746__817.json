The above function is written with a hypothetical knowledge of how to filter and modify columns in a DataFrame. If you are using a specific package, you would need to replace `DataFrame` with the actual package name and use its functions to read/write to CSV files or databases as necessary.","status":200,"tokens":[143,254],"elapsed":6.696871957,"_type":"aimessage"}]
