It then creates a new column `audi_a4_type` and assigns `true` to all rows in that column. Finally, it returns the resulting filtered and updated DataFrame.\n\nPlease note that you should replace `df_cars` with the actual `DataFrame` you want to filter, and ensure that the columns `manufacturer` and `model` exist in the dataset.","status":200,"tokens":[0,315],"elapsed":10.255138011,"_type":"aimessage"}]
