It then adds a new column `audi_a4_type` with a `true` value for all rows.\n\nTo use this function, you would call it with your DataFrame:\n\n```julia\ndf_filtered = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```\n\nThe resulting `df_filtered` will contain the filtered rows with the new column added.","status":200,"tokens":[0,286],"elapsed":7.586522285,"_type":"aimessage"}]
