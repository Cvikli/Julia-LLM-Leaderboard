Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    # Filter for Audi manufacturer and \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\" models\n    audi_cars = df_cars[df_cars.manufacturer .== \"audi\", :]\n    audi_a4_cars = audi_cars[audi_cars.model .== \"a4\" | audi_cars.model .== \"a4 quattro\", :]\n\n    # Create a new column with `true` for all rows\n    audi_a4_cars[:audi_a4_type] = true\n\n    return audi_a4_cars\nend\n```\n\nThis function first filters the original `df_cars` to only include rows where the manufacturer is \"audi\". It then further filters this subset to include only cars with model names of \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". Finally, it creates a new column called `audi_a4_type` and sets it to `true` for all rows in the filtered dataset.","status":200,"tokens":[0,239],"elapsed":10.733560725,"_type":"aimessage"}]
