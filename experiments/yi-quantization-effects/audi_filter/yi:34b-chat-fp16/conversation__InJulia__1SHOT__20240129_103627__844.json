[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a DataFrame `df_cars` with car data with columns `manufacturer` and `model`. Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

The function `audi_filter` will return a new `DataFrame` that contains only rows where the manufacturer is \"audi\" and the model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\", with an additional column `audi_a4_type` that has a value of `true` for all rows.","status":200,"tokens":[0,298],"elapsed":23.104563474,"_type":"aimessage"}]
