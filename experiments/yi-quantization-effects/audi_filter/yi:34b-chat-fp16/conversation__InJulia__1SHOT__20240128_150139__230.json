Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

The function `audi_filter` takes a `DataFrame` as input and returns a new `DataFrame` with only the rows that meet the specified conditions for manufacturer and model, along with an added column called `audi_a4_type` that is set to `true` for all rows in the filtered dataset.","status":200,"tokens":[0,277],"elapsed":21.471155546,"_type":"aimessage"}]
