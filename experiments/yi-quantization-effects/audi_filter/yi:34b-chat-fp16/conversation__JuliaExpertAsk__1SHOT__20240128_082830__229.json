Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    # Filter for Audi manufacturer and model \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\"\n    df_audi = filter(row -> row.manufacturer == \"audi\" && (row.model == \"a4\" || row.model == \"a4 quattro\"), df_cars)\n    # Add a new column with `true` for all rows\n    df_audi[:audi_a4_type] .= true\n    return df_audi\nend\n```\n\nThis function filters the given DataFrame `df_cars` using the `filter` function, which returns a new DataFrame containing only those rows where the condition specified by the predicate function is met. The predicate function checks if the `manufacturer` column equals \"audi\" and the `model` column equals either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\".\n\nAfter filtering, a new column named `audi_a4_type` is added with the value `true` for all rows in the filtered DataFrame using broadcasting (`.=`) to assign a boolean vector to the newly created column.","status":200,"tokens":[0,253],"elapsed":19.617914804,"_type":"aimessage"}]
