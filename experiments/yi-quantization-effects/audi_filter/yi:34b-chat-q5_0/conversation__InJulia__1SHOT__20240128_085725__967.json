The `.` before `==` and `!=` is a broadcast operation that applies the equality check to every element of the corresponding array.\n\nPlease note that you need to replace `# Your data here` with the actual `DataFrame` `df_cars` containing car data.","status":200,"tokens":[0,290],"elapsed":9.203924068,"_type":"aimessage"}]
