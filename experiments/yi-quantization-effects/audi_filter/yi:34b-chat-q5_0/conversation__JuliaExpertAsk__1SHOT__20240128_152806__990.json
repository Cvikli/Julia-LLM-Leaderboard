Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    # Filter the dataframe to only rows with manufacturer \"audi\" and model being \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\"\n    df_audi = filter(row -> row[:manufacturer] == \"audi\" && (row[:model] == \"a4\" || row[:model] == \"a4 quattro\"), df_cars)\n    # Create a new column `audi_a4_type` and set it to true for all rows\n    df_audi[:audi_a4_type] .= true\n    return df_audi\nend\n```\n\nThis function first filters the given DataFrame `df_cars` using the `filter` function, which takes a row predicate (a function that returns `true` or `false`) and keeps only the rows where the predicate is `true`. The predicate checks if the manufacturer is \"audi\" and the model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\".\n\nNext, it creates a new column called `audi_a4_type` using broadcasting assignment (`.=`) to set all values in this new column to `true`. The resulting DataFrame with only the filtered rows and the new column is then returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,282],"elapsed":8.964833439,"_type":"aimessage"}]
