Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df::DataFrame)\n    # Filter df to only include Audi A4 and A4 Quattro models\n    df_filtered = filter(row -> row[:manufacturer] == \"audi\" && (row[:model] == \"a4\" || row[:model] == \"a4 quattro\"), df)\n    \n    # Create new column `audi_a4_type` with value `true` for all rows\n    df_filtered[!, :audi_a4_type] .= true\n    \n    return df_filtered\nend\n```\n\nThis function first filters the `df_cars` DataFrame to only include rows where the manufacturer is \"audi\" and the model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\" using the `filter` function with a predicate that checks both conditions. It then creates a new column called `audi_a4_type` and assigns `true` to all entries in this column using broadcasting (`.=`). Finally, it returns the filtered DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[143,235],"elapsed":7.633405647,"_type":"aimessage"}]
