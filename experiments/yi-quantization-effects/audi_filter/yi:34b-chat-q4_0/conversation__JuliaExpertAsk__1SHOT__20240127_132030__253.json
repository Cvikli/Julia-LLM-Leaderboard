Then it filters this subset further to include only those models that are either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". Finally, it iterates over each row of the filtered dataset and sets the new column `audi_a4_type` to `true` for all rows. The function returns the resulting DataFrame with the added column.","status":200,"tokens":[143,249],"elapsed":6.763368351,"_type":"aimessage"}]
