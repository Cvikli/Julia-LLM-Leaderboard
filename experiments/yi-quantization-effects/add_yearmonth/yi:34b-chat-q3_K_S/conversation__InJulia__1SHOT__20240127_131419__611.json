To extract the year and month from a `DateTime` column and concatenate them into a new column in the format \"yyyymm\", you can write a function like this:\n\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    new_column = Vector{Union{String, Missing}}(undef, length(df.dt))\n    for (i, dt) in enumerate(df.dt)\n        if isnothing(dt)\n            new_column[i] = missing\n            continue\n        end\n        y, m = yearmonth(dt)  # Extract year and month from DateTime\n        new_column[i] = string(y)[2:6] * string(m + 1)[1:3]  # Concatenate with leading zeros\n    end\n    return new_column\nend\n```\n\nHere's how you can use the function with a `DataFrame`:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nimport Statistics: mean\ndf = DataFrame(DT = [DateTime(\"2019-01-01T00:00\"), DateTime(\"2019-04-30T23:59\"), DateTime(\"2018-12-31T23:59\")])\ndf.ym = add_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThe `add_yearmonth` function first checks if the `DateTime` column contains missing values and skips them by assigning `missing` to the corresponding elements of the new column. Then it iterates over the non-missing dates, extracting year and month from each DateTime, and concatenating them into a string with leading zeros for the month to ensure that the format is consistent across all rows.\n\nNote that if you want to use this function in a version of Julia prior to 1.3, you might need to replace `import Statistics: mean` with `using BaseStats: mean` since the `mean` function was moved from `BaseStats` to `Statistics` in later versions of Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[0,470],"elapsed":12.526101329,"_type":"aimessage"}]
