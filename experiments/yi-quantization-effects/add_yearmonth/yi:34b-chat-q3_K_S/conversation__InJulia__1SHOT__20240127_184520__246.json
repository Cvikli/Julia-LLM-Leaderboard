Then it concatenates them together as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\" using multiplication and addition. Finally, it appends the resulting integers to a new vector `new_column`, which will hold the extracted years and months.\n\nTo use this function with your DataFrame, you would simply call:\n\n```julia\ndf[:, :ym] = add_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThis will create a new column `ym` in the DataFrame `df` containing the concatenated year and month for each date. If the original `dt` column had missing dates, they will be reflected as missing values in the new `ym` column.","status":200,"tokens":[80,381],"elapsed":10.289539187,"_type":"aimessage"}]
