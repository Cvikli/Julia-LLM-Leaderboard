It then concatenates these as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\". Finally, it appends the new column to the original DataFrame using the `|>` pipe operator and the `vcat` function for vertical concatenation. The resulting column is merged with the existing columns by row.","status":200,"tokens":[0,212],"elapsed":5.650772387,"_type":"aimessage"}]
