Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    # Extract the dates from the DataFrame\n    dates = df.dt |> collect\n    \n    # Create a vector of year and month numbers\n    years = Dates.year.(dates)\n    months = Dates.month.(dates)\n    \n    # Convert to string and concatenate\n    ym_strings = map(x -> string(x[1], x[2]), zip(years, months))\n    \n    # Create a new vector of integers in \"yyyymm\" format\n    ym_ints = parse.(Int64, ym_strings)\n    \n    # Add the new column to the DataFrame\n    df[:ym] = ym_ints\n    \n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function first extracts the dates from the `dt` column of the `DataFrame` using the `collect` method. It then creates two vectors, one for years and another for months, by calling `Dates.year` and `Dates.month` on each date in the vector.\n\nNext, it combines these two vectors into a new vector of strings representing \"yyyymm\" using the `zip` function to pair up elements from both vectors and then converting them to strings with the `string` function.\n\nFinally, it parses these strings into integers using the `parse` function and stores them in a new column called `ym` in the original DataFrame. The result is returned.\n\nTo use this function, simply call it with your DataFrame:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\nusing Statistics\n\n# Example DataFrame\ndf = DataFrame(dt = [Dates.datetime2date(DateTime(\"2023-01-01\")),\n                    Dates.datetime2date(DateTime(\"2023-05-01\")),\n                    Dates.datetime2date(DateTime(\"2024-01-01\"))])\n\n# Call the function\ndf = add_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThis will result in a new column `ym` being added to the DataFrame with values in the \"yyyymm\" format.","status":200,"tokens":[0,498],"elapsed":14.163987872,"_type":"aimessage"}]
