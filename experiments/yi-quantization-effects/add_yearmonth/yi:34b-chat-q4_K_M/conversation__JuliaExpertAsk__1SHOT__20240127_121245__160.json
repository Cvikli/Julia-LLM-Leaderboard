The lambda expression `ByRow(x -> string(x.year, x.month))` applies the following logic: for each row, it extracts the year and month from the DateTime object `x` in the `dt` column and concatenates them as a string using the `string()` function. The resulting strings are formatted as \"yyyymm\".\n\nThe `=> :ym` part of the call to `transform` specifies that the result should be stored in a new column named \"ym\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,186],"elapsed":5.251700622,"_type":"aimessage"}]
