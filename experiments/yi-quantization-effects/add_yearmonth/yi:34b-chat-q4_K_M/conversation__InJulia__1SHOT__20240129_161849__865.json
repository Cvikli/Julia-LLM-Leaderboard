Below is an example of how to do this using the `Date` and `Time` functions provided by the standard library:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    # Extract the dates from the DataFrame\n    dates = Date.(df.dt)\n    \n    # Create a new column with year and month concatenated\n    ym = string.(Dates.year.(dates)) * \"mm\"\n    \n    # Convert back to DateTime if you want to retain the time information\n    # ym = DateTime.(string.(Dates.year.(dates), Dates.month.(dates)))\n    \n    # Add the new column to the DataFrame\n    df[:ym] = ym\n    return df\nend\n\n# Example usage with a sample DataFrame\ndf = DataFrame(dt = DateTime[]) # Your actual DataFrame would have dt as a column\npush!(df, \"2023-01-01T00:00\" => Dict(:dt => DateTime(\"2023-01-01T00:00\")))\npush!(df, \"2023-04-15T12:30\" => Dict(:dt => DateTime(\"2023-04-15T12:30\")))\n\n# Call the function to add the new column\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nIn this example, `add_yearmonth` function first converts the `DateTime` values in the `dt` column into `Date` objects using the `Date` constructor. It then creates a new vector of strings by concatenating the year and month components with an \"mm\" suffix. If you want to retain the time information, you can convert these strings back to `DateTime` objects. Finally, it adds the new `ym` column to the DataFrame.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the `dt` column contains valid `DateTime` values. If your data contains missing or invalid dates, you may need to handle those cases appropriately.","status":200,"tokens":[0,507],"elapsed":14.7013307,"_type":"aimessage"}]
