The year is converted to an integer and the month is divided by 10 (to get the first two digits of the month), then multiplied by 10 to ensure it's a two-digit string. These are then concatenated together as a string in the format \"yyyymm\".\n\nThe `hcat` function is used to merge the new column with the existing DataFrame without modifying the original. The `new_col => :ym` syntax is an anonymous function that gives the new column the name `ym`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,232],"elapsed":6.593173824,"_type":"aimessage"}]
