It first extracts the date components from the `DateTime` using the `Date` constructors and then converts the dates to integers for the year and month. The months are adjusted to be 0-based because the \"mm\" format in string representation requires it. Finally, the year and month are concatenated into a vector of strings in the \"yyyymm\" format and added as a new column `ym` to the `DataFrame`.","status":200,"tokens":[110,311],"elapsed":8.95990322,"_type":"aimessage"}]
