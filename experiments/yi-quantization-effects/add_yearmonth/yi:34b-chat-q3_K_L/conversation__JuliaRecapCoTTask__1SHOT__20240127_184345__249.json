[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

Here's how you can add a new column to a DataFrame by extracting year and month from existing DateTime columns:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[!, :ym] = DateFormat(\"yyyymm\", TimeZoneAbstraction.UTC).format.([DateTime(x) for x in df.dt])\n    return df\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ndf_with_ym = add_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nIn this code, we use the `Dates` standard library to convert the DateTime column to a format that can be easily manipulated as an integer representing the year and month. We then create a new column `ym` by formatting each DateTime with a custom DateFormat string that outputs in the desired \"yyyymm\" format.\n\nPlease provide any special instructions or additional details if they are required for the task at hand.","status":200,"tokens":[0,235],"elapsed":6.566592277,"_type":"aimessage"}]
