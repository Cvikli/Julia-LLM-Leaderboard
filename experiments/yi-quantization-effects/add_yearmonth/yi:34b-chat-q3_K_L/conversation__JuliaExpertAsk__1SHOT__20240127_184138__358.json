The year is concatenated with the month as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\", where `lpad(x, n, fill)` pads `x` with `fill` (defaults to a space) on the left to make it have length `n`.\n\nThe function uses broadcasting to apply this operation to each element of the column and assign the result to a new column named `ym` in the DataFrame.\n\nTo use this function, you simply call it with your DataFrame as an argument:\n\n```julia\ndf = add_yearmonth(your_dataframe)\n```\n\nThis will modify `df` in-place and add the new `ym` column to it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,267],"elapsed":7.353956526,"_type":"aimessage"}]
