Below is an example of how you can define such a function using the `DateTime` type and the `Dates` standard library.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    new_column = Vector{Int64}() # Initialize an empty vector to hold the year-month integers\n    for date in eachrow(df.dt) # Loop over each row of the `dt` column\n        # Extract year and month from DateTime object\n        year, month = yearmonth(date)\n        # Convert to integer and append to the new_column vector\n        push!(new_column, Int64(string(year) * string(lpad(month, 2, '0'))))\n    end\n    df[:ym] = new_column # Add the new column to the DataFrame\n    return df\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ndf = DataFrame(dt=DateTime.([\"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z\", \"2023-02-01T00:00:00Z\", \"2023-03-01T00:00:00Z\"]))\nnew_df = add_yearmonth(df)\nprintln(new_df)\n```\n\nIn this example, `eachrow` is used to iterate over each row of the `dt` column, and the `DateTime` object is dereferenced to get the raw value. The `yearmonth` function from the `Dates` standard library is used to extract the year and month components of the date. Then, these are converted to a string in the format \"yyyymm\" and finally converted back to an integer for consistency with the rest of the DataFrame.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the `dt` column contains valid `DateTime` objects. If you have strings or other types of data in your `dt` column, you will need to parse them into valid `DateTime` objects before using this function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,479],"elapsed":13.252344709,"_type":"aimessage"}]
