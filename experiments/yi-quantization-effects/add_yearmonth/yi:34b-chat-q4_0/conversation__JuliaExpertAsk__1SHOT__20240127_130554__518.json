It then creates a new column named `ym` by extracting the year (`Year(x)`) and month (`Month(x)`) from each date-time value in the `dt` column, converting them to integers, and concatenating them together as an integer string in the format \"yyyymm\".\n\nThe result is a new DataFrame with an additional column `ym` that contains the year-month representations of the dates in the original `dt` column.","status":200,"tokens":[0,207],"elapsed":5.470472199,"_type":"aimessage"}]
