[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

We then iterate over each row of the DataFrame and extract the year and month from the `DateTime` object stored in `df[:dt]`. The year is formatted as-is, while the month is formatted without leading zeros (e.g., \"1\" for January). These are then concatenated together to form a string in the \"yyyymm\" format.\n\nFinally, we use the `|>` pipeline operator to filter out any rows where the newly created `ym` column is an empty string and select all columns except for the new one. This is done to ensure that the original DataFrame is not modified when the function is applied.","status":200,"tokens":[0,324],"elapsed":8.719226757,"_type":"aimessage"}]
