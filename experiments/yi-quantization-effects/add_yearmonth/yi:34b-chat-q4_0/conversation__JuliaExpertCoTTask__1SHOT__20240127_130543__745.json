Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    return transform(df, :dt => ByRow((x -> string(year(x)) * string(month(x))) => :ym) => ByRow(split => (ym,)) => (:, :ym) => ((ym1, ym2) -> [ym1, ym2]), renamecols = false)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `ByRow` operator to apply a custom function that extracts the year and month from each DateTime in the `dt` column. The `string` function is used to convert the year and month values to strings, which are then concatenated together with the `*` operator to form an integer string in the \"yyyymm\" format.\n\nThe resulting vector of strings is split into two parts using a custom function that applies `split` on the separator `'y'` (year). This results in two vectors, one containing the year and the other containing the month. These are then combined into a tuple and passed to another `ByRow` operator along with a lambda function that takes the two parts of the tuple and returns them as a vector.\n\nFinally, the `renamecols` option is set to `false` to ensure that the column names remain unchanged after the transformation. The original column `dt` is also preserved in the output DataFrame, which is why it's included in the first argument of the tuple passed to the last `ByRow` operator.","status":200,"tokens":[0,322],"elapsed":8.574052254,"_type":"aimessage"}]
