Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    new_col = Vector{String}()\n    for date in df.dt\n        year, month = split.(string.([date]), \"-\")\n        push!(new_col, string(year[1:4], lpad(month[2:3], 2, '0')))\n    end\n    return new_col\nend\n```\n\nThis function assumes that the `dt` column is of type `DateTime` and it will extract the year and month from each element in the column. It then concatenates them into a string in the format \"yyyymm\" and returns a vector of these strings, which can be used to create a new column in the DataFrame. To add this new column to the DataFrame, you would typically use `transform!` or `combine` from the `DataFrames` package:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\ndf = # Your dataframe with a DateTime column named dt\nnew_col = add_yearmonth(df)\n# To modify the original DataFrame and add the new column\ntransform!(df, :dt => AddYearMonth() => :ym)\n# Alternatively, if you don't want to modify the original:\nnew_df = transform(df, :dt => AddYearMonth() => :ym)\n```\n\nThe `AddYearMonth` function is a custom transformation that applies the `add_yearmonth` function to each element in the `dt` column. The result is a new DataFrame with an additional column named `ym`.","status":200,"tokens":[110,356],"elapsed":27.638845077,"_type":"aimessage"}]
