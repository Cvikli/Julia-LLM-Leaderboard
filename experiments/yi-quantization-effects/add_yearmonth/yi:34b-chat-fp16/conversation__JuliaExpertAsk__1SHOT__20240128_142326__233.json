It uses the `map` function to apply the conversion to each element of the `df[:, :dt]` column, where `x.value` is used to access the underlying `DateTime` object. The result is then assigned back to the DataFrame using `df[!, :ym] = ...` to ensure that the new column is correctly aligned with the existing columns.","status":200,"tokens":[0,198],"elapsed":15.336689181,"_type":"aimessage"}]
