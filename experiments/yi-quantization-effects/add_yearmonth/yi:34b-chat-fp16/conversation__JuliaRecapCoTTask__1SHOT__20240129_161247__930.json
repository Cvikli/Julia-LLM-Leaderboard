[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

It then assigns this new column back to the DataFrame under the name `ym`.\n\nThe `@assert` macro is used to ensure that the DataFrame has a column named `dt` before proceeding with the function. This is a safeguard to prevent any potential issues if the input DataFrame does not match the expected structure.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you are using a recent version of Julia (1.6 or later), which includes the `|>` operator for forward pipe syntax and the `Symbol` type for creating symbols from strings. If you are using an older version of Julia, you may need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[11,317],"elapsed":24.735616441,"_type":"aimessage"}]
