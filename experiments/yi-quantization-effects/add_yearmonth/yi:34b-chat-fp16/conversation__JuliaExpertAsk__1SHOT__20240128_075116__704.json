It uses `floor` to get the year and `mod` to get the month. Then it converts these to integers and concatenates them with string formatting to create the desired `yyyymm` format. Finally, the new column `ym` is added to the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[110,164],"elapsed":12.783459507,"_type":"aimessage"}]
