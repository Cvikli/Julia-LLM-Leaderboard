It applies `Dates.format` to each element of the `dt` column to convert the DateTimes into strings in the format \"yyyymm\", and then it uses the `parse` function to convert those strings into integer values of the same format. Finally, it assigns the result to a new column named `ym` in the DataFrame `df`.","status":200,"tokens":[110,161],"elapsed":4.29054965,"_type":"aimessage"}]
