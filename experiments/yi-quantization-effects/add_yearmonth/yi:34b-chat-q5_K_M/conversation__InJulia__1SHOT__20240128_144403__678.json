It first converts these dates into a vector of `Date` objects, which makes it easier to extract the year and month components. Then, it iterates over this vector and creates a new vector `ym` where each element is a concatenation of the year and month as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\". Finally, it adds this new column `ym` to the DataFrame `df`.\n\nYou can call this function on your original DataFrame like so:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\n# Sample data\ndf = DataFrame(dt = DateTime[DateTime(2023, 1, 1), DateTime(2023, 2, 1)])\n\n# Apply the function to add a new column\ndf = add_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nAfter running this code, `df` will have an additional column named `ym` with values like \"202301\" for January 2023 and \"202302\" for February 2023.","status":200,"tokens":[80,476],"elapsed":15.693656284,"_type":"aimessage"}]
