It then concatenates these into a string in the format \"yyyymm\" and assigns this to a new column `:ym` in the DataFrame. The `!` after `[, :ym]` indicates that we're creating a new column in-place, without making a copy of the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[110,182],"elapsed":6.078220527,"_type":"aimessage"}]
