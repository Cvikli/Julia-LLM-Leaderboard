Below is an example of how you can extract the year and month from a `DateTime` column and concatenate them into a new `Int64` column formatted as \"yyyymm\".\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    # Extract dates as Date type for easier manipulation\n    dates = Date.(df.dt)\n    \n    # Calculate year and month\n    years = [string(year(date)) for date in dates]\n    months = [string(month(date)) for date in dates]\n    \n    # Concatenate into a single vector\n    ym_strings = vcat(years, months)\n    \n    # Convert to integers and concatenate as an integer array\n    ym_ints = map(ym_string -> parse(Int64, ym_string, base=10), ym_strings)\n    \n    # Create a new column in the DataFrame with the yearmonths\n    df[!, :ym] = ym_ints\n    \n    return df\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ndf = rand(DateTime, 100) |> collect # Generate a random DataFrame for demonstration\nprintln(\"Original DataFrame:\\n$df\")\ndf2 = add_yearmonth(df)\nprintln(\"DataFrame with added ym column:\\n$df2\")\n```\n\nThis function first converts the `DateTime` column to a vector of dates, then calculates the year and month for each date. It concatenates these into a single vector of strings, which are then converted to integers and used to create a new `ym` column in the DataFrame. Finally, it returns the updated DataFrame with the new column.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the `dt` column contains valid dates and does not include any error handling for invalid date values or edge cases such as February 29th in non-leap years.","status":200,"tokens":[0,453],"elapsed":16.840420022,"_type":"aimessage"}]
