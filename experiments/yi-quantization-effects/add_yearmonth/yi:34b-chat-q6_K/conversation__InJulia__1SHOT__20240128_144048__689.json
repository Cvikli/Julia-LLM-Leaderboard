Extracts the dates from the `DateTime` column as `Date` type, since we only need the year and month, not the time component.\n2. Calculates the years and months of each date using the `Year` and `Month` constructors.\n3. Concatenates each year with its corresponding month in a string using `string(x[1], \"-\", x[2])`, where `x` is a tuple containing the year and month.\n4. Converts these strings to integers in the format \"yyyymm\" using `parse`.\n5. Finally, it adds the new column `ym` to the DataFrame with the concatenated year-month values as integers.\n\nYou can use this function by calling it on your DataFrame like so:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\n# Example DataFrame with a DateTime column\ndf = DataFrame(dt = [DateTime(\"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z\"), DateTime(\"2023-02-01T00:00:00Z\")])\n\n# Call the function to add the new column\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThis will update `df` to include a new column `ym` with values like \"202301\" for January 2023, and \"202302\" for February 2023.","status":200,"tokens":[0,567],"elapsed":21.142033799,"_type":"aimessage"}]
