Here's how you can write such a function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(x -> Date(x) |> year * 100 + month, df.dt)\n    return df\nend\n\n# Example usage:\n# Assuming df is your DataFrame with a column dt of type DateTime\ndf_with_ym = add_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nIn this function, we use the `map` function to apply a lambda expression to each element in the `dt` column. We convert the `DateTime` to a `Date` using the `|>` operator for readability, then we extract the year and month from the `Date` object and concatenate them together as an integer in the \"yyyymm\" format by multiplying the year by 100 and adding the month.\n\nNote that this function assumes that your DataFrame has a column named `dt` containing `DateTime` values. It will create a new column named `ym` with the concatenated year and month in the specified format.","status":200,"tokens":[0,301],"elapsed":13.504862332,"_type":"aimessage"}]
