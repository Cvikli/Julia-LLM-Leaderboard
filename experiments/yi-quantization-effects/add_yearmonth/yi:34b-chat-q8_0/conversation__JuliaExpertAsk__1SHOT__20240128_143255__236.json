It does this by extracting the year and month from each DateTime object using the `DateTime(::Date)` constructor to ensure consistent formatting, then concatenating them into a string with leading zeros for the month if necessary. Finally, it returns the new column as a vector of strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,204],"elapsed":9.152036754,"_type":"aimessage"}]
