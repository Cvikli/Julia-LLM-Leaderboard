The following function will add a new `ym` column to a DataFrame `df` that contains the year and month concatenated together as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\".\n\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    # Assuming df has a column named 'dt' with DateTime values\n    new_column = Vector{Int64}() # Create an empty vector to hold the year-month integers\n    for date in df.dt # Loop through each element in the 'dt' column\n        # Extract the year and month from the DateTime object\n        year, month = Date(date).value.era.year, Date(date).value.month\n        # Concatenate them together as an integer in \"yyyymm\" format\n        ym_int = 10000 * year + month\n        push!(new_column, ym_int)\n    end\n    df[!, :ym] = new_column # Add the new column to the DataFrame\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nTo use this function with your DataFrame `df`, simply call it as follows:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n# Assuming 'dt' is a column in 'df' containing DateTime values\ndf = add_yearmonth(df)\nprintln(\"New DataFrame with added 'ym' column:\")\ndisplay(df)\n```\n\nThis will output the DataFrame with the new `ym` column added. Note that this function assumes that `dt` contains valid DateTime objects and that you are only interested in the year and month components of these dates. If you want to include other date components (e.g., day) or if your `dt` column is of a different type, you may need to adjust the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[80,423],"elapsed":19.168729184,"_type":"aimessage"}]
