Below is an example of how you might write such a function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    dt = df[:, :dt] # Assuming dt is the name of the column\n    ym = map(x -> parse(Int64, string(year(x) * 100 + month(x)), base=10), dt)\n    return DataFrame!(df, [:ym => ym])\nend\n\n# Example usage with a sample DataFrame\ndf = DataFrame(dt = [DateTime(\"2023-05-10\"), DateTime(\"2023-06-21\")])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nIn the above code:\n\n1. We first define a function `add_yearmonth` that takes a DataFrame `df` as input.\n2. We access the column `dt` from the DataFrame using `[:, :dt]` syntax. This is how you select columns in a DataFrame in Julia.\n3. We use `map` to apply a function to each element of the `dt` column. The function itself uses `year` and `month` to extract year and month from each DateTime value, then concatenates them with `string`, and finally converts the string to an integer using `parse`.\n4. We create a new DataFrame by adding a new column `ym` to the original DataFrame `df` using `DataFrame!` function. This function modifies the input DataFrame in place and returns it.\n5. Finally, we demonstrate how to use the `add_yearmonth` function with a sample DataFrame containing two DateTime values.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you are using at least Julia version 1.6, as the `DataFrame!` function is new and was introduced in that version. If you are using an older version of Julia, you will need to use the `combine` or similar functions to achieve a similar result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,512],"elapsed":23.048501864,"_type":"aimessage"}]
