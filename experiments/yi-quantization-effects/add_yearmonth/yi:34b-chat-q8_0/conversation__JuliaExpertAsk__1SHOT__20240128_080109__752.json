It then converts these to integers (using `floor(Int)` to ensure whole numbers), concatenates them with multiplication, and finally applies `string()` to convert the result to a string in the desired format. The new column `ym` is then added to the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[110,163],"elapsed":7.481667124,"_type":"aimessage"}]
