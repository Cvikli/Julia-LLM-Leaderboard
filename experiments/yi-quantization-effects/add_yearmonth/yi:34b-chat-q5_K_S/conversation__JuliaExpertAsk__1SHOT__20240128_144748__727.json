Then, it applies the `DateTimePart` function from the Julia DateTime API to extract the year and month components from the DateTime in each row. The `DateTimePart` function is used with two tuples: one for extracting the year and another for extracting the month. The resulting vectors are combined using string concatenation and then assigned to a new column `ym` in the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[110,196],"elapsed":6.377134676,"_type":"aimessage"}]
