For each date time object `x` in the column, it extracts the year and month using `x.value.year` and `x.value.month`, respectively, and concatenates them together as a string in the format \"yyyymm\". The resulting strings are then assigned to the new column `ym` in the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,157],"elapsed":4.992687786,"_type":"aimessage"}]
