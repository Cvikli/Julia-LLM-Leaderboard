The lambda expression converts each DateTime object to a string and then extracts the year (first 4 characters) and month (next 2 characters), concatenating them together into an integer format. Finally, the result is assigned to a new column named `ym` in the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,140],"elapsed":4.455964781,"_type":"aimessage"}]
