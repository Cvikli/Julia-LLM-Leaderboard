[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

Define a new function `add_yearmonth` that takes a DataFrame `df` as an argument.\n2. Inside the function, create a new column `ym` by applying `map` over the existing `dt` column.\n3. The anonymous function passed to `map` should extract the year and month from each DateTime in `df.dt` using `Dates.year` and `Dates.month`, respectively.\n4. Concatenate the year and month as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\" by string concatenation using `*`.\n5. Convert the resulting tuples to strings using `string`.\n6. Assign the new column `ym` back to the DataFrame.\n7. Return the updated DataFrame.\n\n#### Double-check that the Solution is Correct\n1. Ensure that the function definition and usage are syntactically correct.\n2. Check if the format of the resulting `ym` column is as expected (\"yyyymm\").\n3. Verify that the example usage provided gives the desired output.\n\n### Additional Notes\n- The solution uses only standard Julia libraries, specifically the `Dates` library for date manipulation.\n- The function is written to be generic and can be applied to any DataFrame with a column of type DateTime.\n- The result is a new DataFrame with an additional column named `ym` containing the year and month as an integer in \"yyyymm\" format.","status":200,"tokens":[391,544],"elapsed":17.822154048,"_type":"aimessage"}]
