Here's how you can define the `add_yearmonth` function that extracts the year and month from the `DateTime` column `dt` and concatenates them as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\":\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\nusing Statistics: year, month\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    # Extract the DateTime column\n    dt = df[:, :dt]\n\n    # Define a new column with year and month concatenated\n    ym = string.(year.(dt)) * \"mm\"\n\n    # Convert the new column to an integer array in format yyyyMM (note that MM is a zero-padded month)\n    ym_int = map(ym_str -> parse(Int, ym_str, base=10), ym)\n\n    # Create a new DataFrame with the original columns and the added yearmonth column\n    return vcat(df, DataFrame(:ym => ym_int))\nend\n```\n\nIn this function:\n\n- We first extract the `DateTime` column from the DataFrame using `[:, :dt]`.\n- Then we use `year.(dt)` to get an array of years corresponding to each row in the `dt` column and `month.(dt)` for months.\n- We concatenate the year and zero-padded month by appending \"mm\" to each string representation of the year, which results in a vector of strings like \"202301\".\n- To convert these strings into an integer array in the format `yyyymm`, we use `parse(Int, ym_str, base=10)` for each element of `ym`. This will parse the string as an integer with a custom base of 10 (which is unnecessary but included for clarity).\n- Finally, we create a new DataFrame by concatenating (`vcat`) the original DataFrame with a new DataFrame that has a single column named `:ym` with the integer array we just created.\n\nTo use this function with your existing DataFrame `df`, you would simply call:\n\n```julia\ndf_with_ym = add_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThis will give you a new DataFrame with an additional column named `:ym` containing the concatenated year and month in the format \"yyyymm\" as integers.","status":200,"tokens":[0,547],"elapsed":17.444772211,"_type":"aimessage"}]
