[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

It then creates a new `DataFrame` with the modified column named `ym`.\n\nThe usage example demonstrates how to apply the function to an existing `DataFrame` and print out the original and modified dataframes for comparison.\n\nFor this specific task, we have not been provided with any Special Instructions. However, if there were special instructions or requirements, such as handling edge cases (e.g., invalid dates) or performing additional checks, those would be implemented within the `add_yearmonth` function accordingly. The example usage shows how to use the function with a simple DataFrame containing two rows of DateTime data.","status":200,"tokens":[0,452],"elapsed":14.584604064,"_type":"aimessage"}]
