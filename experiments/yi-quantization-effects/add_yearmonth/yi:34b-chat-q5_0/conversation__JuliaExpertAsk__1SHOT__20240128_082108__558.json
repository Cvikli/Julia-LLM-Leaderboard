If you need the full month as a string (e.g., \"2023-05\"), you would use `dateformat` or `Dates.format`:\n\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:, :ym] = @. Dates.format(dt, \"yyyymm\")\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nPlease note that the second approach using `Dates.format` is more robust and flexible for handling different date formats, while the first approach using `string` concatenation is simpler but less versatile.","status":200,"tokens":[110,237],"elapsed":7.681596672,"_type":"aimessage"}]
