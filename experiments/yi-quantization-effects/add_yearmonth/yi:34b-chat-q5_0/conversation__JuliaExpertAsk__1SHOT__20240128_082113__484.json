The `@.` operator applies the expression on both sides of the dot to each element in an array, and the `DateFormat` constructor is used to create a custom date format string. Finally, the `format` method from the Dates module is called to convert the DateTime objects to strings in the desired format. The result is assigned to a new column named \"ym\" in the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,154],"elapsed":4.872439445,"_type":"aimessage"}]
