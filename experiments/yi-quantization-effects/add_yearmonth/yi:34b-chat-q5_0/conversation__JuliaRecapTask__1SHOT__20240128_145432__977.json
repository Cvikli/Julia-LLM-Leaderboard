[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

This allows us to use it as a conversion from string to integer when necessary. The `map` function is used to apply the extraction logic to each element in the `dtcol` column, and then the new column `ym` is added to the data frame with `eachrow()` to ensure that the resulting column has the same number of rows as the original data frame.\n\nTo use this function, you would simply call it with your DataFrame and the name of the DateTime column:\n\n```julia\ndf = # Your DataFrame with a 'dt' column of DateTimes\nadd_yearmonth(df, :dt)\n```\n\nAfter calling this function, the resulting `DataFrame` will have an additional column named `ym` containing the concatenated year and month for each row in the `dt` column.","status":200,"tokens":[0,478],"elapsed":15.438335874,"_type":"aimessage"}]
