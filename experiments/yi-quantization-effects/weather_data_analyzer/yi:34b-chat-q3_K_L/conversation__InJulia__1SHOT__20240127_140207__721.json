For the temperature trend analysis, it uses linear regression with a simple least-squares method to fit a line of best fit. If the slope of this line is greater than a small positive number (defined as `eps()`), which is a machine epsilon and effectively a very small number close to zero, then we can consider there's an increasing or decreasing trend. Otherwise, it's considered stable. The `trend` can be one of the following strings: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`.\n\nThe function returns a named tuple with the calculated values. If the list of temperatures is empty, it returns a named tuple with all fields set to `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,432],"elapsed":11.970342676,"_type":"aimessage"}]
