Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{T}) where T<:Real\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    mean_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Calculate the difference between each pair of consecutive temperatures and check the trend\n    diffs = temps[2:end] - temps[1:(end-1)]  # Calculate differences\n    is_increasing = all(x -> x > 0, diffs)  # Check if all differences are positive (increasing)\n    is_decreasing = all(x -> x < 0, diffs)  # Check if all differences are negative (decreasing)\n    is_stable = is_increasing && is_decreasing # If both are false, it's stable\n\n    trend = if is_increasing\n        \":increasing\"\n    elseif is_decreasing\n        \":decreasing\"\n    else\n        \":stable\"\n    end\n\n    return (average=mean_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ntemps = [25, 27, 23, 20, 22]  # Temperature data\nweather_data_analyzer(temps)  # Call the function with given temperature data\n```\n\nThe `weather_data_analyzer` function follows these steps:\n\n1.

Find the maximum and minimum temperatures using `maximum(temps)` and `minimum(temps)`.\n4. Calculate the differences between consecutive temperatures (`diffs`).\n5. Determine if the trend is increasing, decreasing, or stable based on the differences:\n   - If all differences are positive, it's an increasing trend.\n   - If all differences are negative, it's a decreasing trend.\n   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it's a stable trend (no clear pattern).\n6. Return a named tuple with the calculated average, maximum, and minimum temperatures, as well as the determined trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,540],"elapsed":15.086298018,"_type":"aimessage"}]
