It also checks for a temperature trend by comparing each temperature to the mean and looking at the order of differences. If all differences are less than or equal to zero, the trend is considered decreasing; if all differences are greater than or equal to zero, the trend is increasing; otherwise, it's stable.\n\nPlease note that the `trend` analysis is a simplistic approach and does not account for seasonality or other factors that could influence temperature patterns over time. For a more sophisticated analysis, you might consider using time series methods or additional data points.","status":200,"tokens":[0,487],"elapsed":15.553005188,"_type":"aimessage"}]
