To determine the temperature trend, it uses a simple moving average method with a window size of 3. If the mean matches the maximum and minimum temperatures, the trend is considered stable. Otherwise, if the mean is between the max and min, the function checks whether the moving averages are increasing or decreasing to determine the trend. If the list is empty, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing` as specified in the requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,375],"elapsed":11.962004495,"_type":"aimessage"}]
