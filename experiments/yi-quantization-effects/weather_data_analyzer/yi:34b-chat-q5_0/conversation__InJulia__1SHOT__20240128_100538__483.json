For the trend analysis, it calculates the differences between consecutive temperatures and checks if they are all non-positive (decreasing trend) or non-negative (increasing trend). If there are both positive and negative differences, the trend is considered stable. If the list is empty, the function returns a named tuple with `nothing` for all values.","status":200,"tokens":[156,498],"elapsed":16.089324602,"_type":"aimessage"}]
