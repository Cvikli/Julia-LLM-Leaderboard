Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package).

If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    # Calculate statistics\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max = maximum(temps)\n    min = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Trend analysis based on differences between consecutive elements\n    diffs = diff(temps)\n    is_increasing = all(diff => 0 for diff in diffs)\n    is_decreasing = all(diff < 0 for diff in diffs)\n    trend = if is_increasing\n        :increasing\n    elseif is_decreasing\n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=average, max=max, min=min, trend=trend)\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,208],"elapsed":5.365337853,"_type":"aimessage"}]
