[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{Number})\n    n = length(temps)\n    if n > 0\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        trend = if avg >= (temps[end] + temps[1]) / 2 && avg <= (temps[end] - temps[1]) / 2\n            :stable\n        elseif avg > (temps[end] + temps[1]) / 2\n            :increasing\n        else\n            :decreasing\n        end\n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    else\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nLet's test the function with some example data:\n\n```julia\ntemps = [23.0, 25.4, 19.8, 26.0]  # Example temperatures\nweather_data_analyzer(temps)  # Should return something like (average=22.75, max=26.0, min=19.8, trend=:increasing)\n```\n\nThe `trend` is determined by comparing the average temperature with the midpoint of the first and last temperature in the list. If the average is within half the distance of the first and last temperatures (half an interquartile range away), it's considered stable; if not, it's either increasing or decreasing based on whether the average is greater than the middle or less than the middle value.","status":200,"tokens":[0,388],"elapsed":10.158576007,"_type":"aimessage"}]
