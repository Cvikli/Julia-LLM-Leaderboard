Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To perform statistical analyses on a list of daily temperature data in Julia using the `Statistics` package, you can write a function like this:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    stats = mean(temps) => :average, maximum(temps) => :max, minimum(temps) => :min\n    mean_change = sum(diff(temps)) / length(temps)\n    std_change = std(diff(temps))\n\n    if std_change > 0 && mean_change >= 0\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif std_change > 0 && mean_change < 0\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (average = stats.average, max = stats.max, min = stats.min, trend = trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of daily temperature data `temps` and returns a named tuple with the average, maximum, minimum temperatures, and a trend indicator. The trend is determined by calculating the mean change and standard deviation of the differences between consecutive temperature values. If the mean change is positive (or zero for stable) and the standard deviation is not zero, it's an increasing trend. Conversely, if the mean change is negative (or zero for stable) and the standard deviation is not zero, it's a decreasing trend. Otherwise, it's considered a stable trend.\n\nYou can use the function like this:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage with some temperature data\ntemps = [30, 25, 28, 31, 26]  # Replace with your actual data\nweather_data_analyzer(temps)\n```\n\nRemember to add the `Statistics` package to your Julia script if you haven't already.","status":200,"tokens":[0,443],"elapsed":11.806785643,"_type":"aimessage"}]
