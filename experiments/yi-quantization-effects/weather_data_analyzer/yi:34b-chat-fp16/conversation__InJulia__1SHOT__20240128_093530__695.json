Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package).

It also calculates the standard deviation of the temperatures and compares it to the mean to determine if the data shows an increasing, decreasing, or stable trend. If the standard deviation is less than 0.1 times the mean, the trend is considered stable; otherwise, it's classified as either increasing or decreasing based on whether the average temperature is greater than the last temperature in the list (assuming that the temperatures are ordered).\n\nIf the list is empty, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`, indicating that there is no data to analyze.","status":200,"tokens":[0,464],"elapsed":36.057606028,"_type":"aimessage"}]
