It also calculates the standard deviation (`std`) and median (`median`) for use in determining the temperature trend. If the list of temperatures is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it returns a named tuple with the calculated statistics. The trend is determined based on whether the median temperature is greater than the average temperature (indicating an increasing trend) or less than the average temperature (indicating a decreasing trend). If the standard deviation is zero, indicating no variation in the data, the trend is considered stable.","status":200,"tokens":[0,336],"elapsed":26.086853249,"_type":"aimessage"}]
