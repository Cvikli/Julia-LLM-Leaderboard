[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    mean_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    trend = if mean_temp > 0 && mean_temp < length(temps) - 1\n        if temps[2] > temps[1] && temps[end] > temps[mean_temp + 1]\n            :increasing\n        elseif temps[2] < temps[1] && temps[end] < temps[mean_temp + 1]\n            :decreasing\n        else\n            :stable\n        end\n    else\n        :unknown\n    end\n\n    return (average = mean_temp, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Statistics` package to calculate the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures. For the trend analysis, it checks if there is a clear increasing or decreasing pattern by comparing the second and last elements of the temperature list with the one at the mean position (excluding the first and last elements). If neither condition is met, it assumes the trend is stable. If the list has fewer than three elements, it cannot determine a trend and returns `:unknown`.\n\nThe function returns a named tuple with the calculated values for average, maximum, minimum, and trend. If any of these calculations are not possible due to an empty list or insufficient data, the corresponding value in the named tuple is set to `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[11,379],"elapsed":29.616616557,"_type":"aimessage"}]
