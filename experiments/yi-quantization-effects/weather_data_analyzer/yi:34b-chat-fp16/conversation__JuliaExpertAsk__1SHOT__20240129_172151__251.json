It also determines a simple trend based on whether the average temperature is increasing or decreasing from day to day, with a threshold to consider stability if the change in average temperature is less than 0.5 degrees. If there's no clear trend (the difference is close to zero), it's considered stable.","status":200,"tokens":[0,327],"elapsed":25.378784588,"_type":"aimessage"}]
