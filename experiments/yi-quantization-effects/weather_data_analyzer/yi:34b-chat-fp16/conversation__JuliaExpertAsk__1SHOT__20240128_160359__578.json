Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    std_dev = std(temps)\n\n    # Trend analysis based on standard deviation.

The trend is determined based on the standard deviation of the temperature data. If there's no change or a small change in the temperatures, the trend is considered stable. Otherwise, if the mean temperature is increasing over time, the trend is marked as `:increasing`, and if it's decreasing, the trend is marked as `:decreasing`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,413],"elapsed":32.109037768,"_type":"aimessage"}]
