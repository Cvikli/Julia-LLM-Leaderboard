It also attempts to determine the trend in the data using a simple moving average with a window size of 3. The trend is marked as `:increasing` if all temperatures within a rolling window of three are increasing, `:decreasing` if they are decreasing, and `:stable` otherwise.\n\nPlease note that this trend detection method is very simplistic and may not accurately represent real-world trends, especially for longer or more complex temperature patterns. In practice, more sophisticated methods like regression analysis or time series analysis would be used to determine the trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,501],"elapsed":38.947951327,"_type":"aimessage"}]
