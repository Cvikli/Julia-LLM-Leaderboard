It also calculates the standard deviation (`std`) and variance (`var`) for use in determining the trend. The trend is determined based on whether the mean temperature is outside the typical range (defined by the standard deviation) relative to the maximum and minimum temperatures. If there is no variation in the data, the trend is considered stable.","status":200,"tokens":[0,362],"elapsed":28.112912302,"_type":"aimessage"}]
