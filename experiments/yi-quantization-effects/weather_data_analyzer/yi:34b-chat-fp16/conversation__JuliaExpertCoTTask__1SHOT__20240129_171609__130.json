Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    diffs = [x - avg_temp for x in temps]\n    trend = if sum(diffs) > 0\n        :increasing\n    elseif sum(diffs) < 0\n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n\n    return (average=avg_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])  # Example usage\n```\n\nPlease note that this function assumes the data is a list of temperatures in degrees Celsius. If the data contains any units other than degrees Celsius, the function will need to be adjusted accordingly. Additionally, the `trend` analysis is very basic and does not take into account seasonal variations or other complex patterns that might be present in real-world weather data.","status":200,"tokens":[0,284],"elapsed":22.076941615,"_type":"aimessage"}]
