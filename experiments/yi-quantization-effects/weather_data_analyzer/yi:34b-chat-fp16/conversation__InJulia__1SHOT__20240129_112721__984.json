It also calculates the standard deviation (`std`) and variance (`var`) using the `Statistics` package. Based on the standard deviation compared to the mean temperature, it determines whether the trend is increasing, decreasing, or stable. If the list is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\nPlease note that this trend analysis based on standard deviation is a simple and rough method. In practice, more sophisticated methods like linear regression might be used for trend analysis.","status":200,"tokens":[0,464],"elapsed":36.061693286,"_type":"aimessage"}]
