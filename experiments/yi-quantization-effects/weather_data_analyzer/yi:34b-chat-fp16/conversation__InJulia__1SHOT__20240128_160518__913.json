Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`).
