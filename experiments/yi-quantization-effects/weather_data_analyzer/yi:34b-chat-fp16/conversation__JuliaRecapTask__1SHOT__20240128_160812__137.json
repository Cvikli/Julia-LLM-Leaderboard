[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`).

If there's a significant slope (i.e., the p-value of the slope is less than 0.05), we classify the trend as increasing or decreasing based on the sign of the slope. Otherwise, the trend is classified as stable.\n- The use of `linreg` from the `Statistics` package calculates the SLR and returns various statistics including the slope, intercept, correlation coefficient (r), p-value, and the standard error of the estimate (se). We only use the slope for our trend determination.\n\nPlease note that the `linreg` function requires at least two data points to perform linear regression, which is why we check if `n > 1` before attempting to calculate the trend. If there's only one data point, we cannot determine a trend and return `nothing` for the `trend` key in the named tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,623],"elapsed":48.693604418,"_type":"aimessage"}]
