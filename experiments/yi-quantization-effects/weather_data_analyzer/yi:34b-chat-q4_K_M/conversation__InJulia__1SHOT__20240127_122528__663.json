If the list is empty, it will return `nothing` for all values in the tuple. The trend is determined based on the standard deviation of the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in the temperature data. If there's no variation (std_dev == 0), the trend is considered stable. If the mean of the differences is positive, the trend is increasing; if it's negative, the trend is decreasing.","status":200,"tokens":[0,444],"elapsed":12.628232279,"_type":"aimessage"}]
