It also calculates the standard deviation (`std`) as a measure of dispersion and the median (`median`) for additional insight into the data. The trend is determined based on the standard deviation and the difference between the maximum and minimum temperatures compared to the length of the list. If the standard deviation is zero or the range (max - min) divided by the number of elements is less than 0.1, the trend is considered stable. Otherwise, if the maximum temperature is greater than the mean, the trend is increasing; otherwise, it's decreasing.","status":200,"tokens":[0,368],"elapsed":10.697980803,"_type":"aimessage"}]
