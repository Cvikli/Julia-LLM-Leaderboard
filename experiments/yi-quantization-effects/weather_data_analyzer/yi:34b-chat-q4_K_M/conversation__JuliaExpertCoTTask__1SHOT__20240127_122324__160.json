Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{Float64})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    # Calculate statistics\n    mean_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Determine temperature trend using linear regression (slope)\n    x = 1:length(temps)\n    y = temps\n    slope, intercept, r, p, std_err = linreg(x, y)\n    trend = if slope > 0.0\n        :increasing\n    elseif slope < 0.0\n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n\n    return (average = mean_temp, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = trend)\nend\n\n# Example usage with provided data\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n```\n\nPlease note that the `linreg` function is not part of the standard Julia libraries. You would need to define it or use a package that provides linear regression functionality. For this example, I've assumed you have access to a `linreg` function that returns the slope, intercept, correlation coefficient (`r`), significance value (`p`), and standard error of the estimate (`std_err`). The temperature trend is determined based on the slope of the linear regression line. If the slope is significantly different from zero, the trend is considered to be increasing or decreasing; otherwise, it's stable.","status":200,"tokens":[0,379],"elapsed":10.842151333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
