To determine the trend, it calculates the average absolute difference between each pair of consecutive values in the list. If this average is close to zero, the trend is considered stable; if it's greater than 99% of the mean temperature, the trend is considered increasing; otherwise, it's decreasing.\n\nThe `isempty` function is used to check if the list is empty, and in that case, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\nPlease note that this example assumes the temperatures are provided in degrees Celsius or another unit where larger numbers represent higher temperatures. If you're working with temperatures in Kelvin, for instance, you would need to adjust the trend determination logic accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[156,623],"elapsed":18.410477445,"_type":"aimessage"}]
