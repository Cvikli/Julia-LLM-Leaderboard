For the trend analysis, it calculates a simple moving average with a window size of 7 to determine if the temperature is increasing, decreasing, or stable. If there isn't enough data (less than 7 elements), it returns `:insufficient_data` for the trend. If the list is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing` as specified in the requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,397],"elapsed":11.591263412,"_type":"aimessage"}]
