It also calculates the standard deviation (`std`) and variance (`var`) for use in determining the temperature trend. The trend is determined by comparing the mean temperature to the first and last elements of the list using `temp => 1` (forward difference) and `temp => -1` (backward difference). If the differences are significantly different from zero, indicating a clear increasing or decreasing trend, the corresponding symbol is assigned. Otherwise, if there's no clear variation, the trend is considered stable.\n\nIf the list is empty, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing` as per the requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,406],"elapsed":11.872114349,"_type":"aimessage"}]
