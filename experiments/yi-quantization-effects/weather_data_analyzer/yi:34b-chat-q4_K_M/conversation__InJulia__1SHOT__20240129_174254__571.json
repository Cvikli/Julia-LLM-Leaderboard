Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`).

It also checks if the data shows an increasing, decreasing, or stable trend by calculating the differences between each value and the mean and looking at the last two differences (the current and previous values) to determine the direction of the change.\n\nIf the list is empty, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing` as required.","status":200,"tokens":[0,477],"elapsed":13.898990627,"_type":"aimessage"}]
