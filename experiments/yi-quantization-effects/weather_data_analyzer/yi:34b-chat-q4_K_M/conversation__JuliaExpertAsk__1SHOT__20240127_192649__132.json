If the list is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. The trend is determined by comparing the difference between the maximum and minimum temperatures across the entire list divided by the number of data points. If the average change per data point is negative, positive, or close to zero (within rounding error), the trend is labeled as decreasing, increasing, or stable, respectively.","status":200,"tokens":[0,331],"elapsed":9.422206359,"_type":"aimessage"}]
