It also calculates the standard deviation (`std`) to determine the trend in the temperature data. If the standard deviation is 0, which means there's no variation in the data, the trend is considered stable. Otherwise, if the mean of the temperatures is greater than the last temperature minus the standard deviation or less than the first temperature plus the standard deviation, the trend is considered increasing or decreasing, respectively. Otherwise, it's also considered stable.","status":200,"tokens":[0,350],"elapsed":10.16697111,"_type":"aimessage"}]
