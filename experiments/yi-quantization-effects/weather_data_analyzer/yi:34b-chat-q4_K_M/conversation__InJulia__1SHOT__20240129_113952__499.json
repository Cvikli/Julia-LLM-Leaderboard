Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package).

If it is, we return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. If not, we calculate the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `Statistics` package. To determine the trend, we iterate over the list and compare the mean of each pair of consecutive values with the overall mean and the maximum temperature. If the mean is consistently higher than the current mean, we consider it an increasing trend, and if it's lower, we consider it a decreasing trend. Otherwise, we classify the trend as stable.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the list of temperatures is ordered and does not account for any complex trends (such as seasonal variations) or missing data. It provides a simple analysis based on the provided data.","status":200,"tokens":[0,568],"elapsed":16.553511281,"_type":"aimessage"}]
