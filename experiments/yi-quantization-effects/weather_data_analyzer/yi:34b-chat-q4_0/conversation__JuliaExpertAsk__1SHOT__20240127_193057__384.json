Calculates the average temperature using `mean()`.\n2. Finds the maximum and minimum temperatures using `maximum()` and `minimum()`, respectively.\n3. Checks for an increasing or decreasing trend by comparing the number of temperatures that are greater than their preceding value (increasing) to the total number of temperatures minus those that are increasing (decreasing). If neither is dominant, it considers the trend to be stable.\n\nThe function returns a named tuple with the following fields:\n\n- `average`: The average temperature.\n- `max`: The maximum temperature.\n- `min`: The minimum temperature.\n- `trend`: The trend in temperatures (:increasing, :decreasing, or :stable).\n\nIf the list is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,435],"elapsed":11.594412865,"_type":"aimessage"}]
