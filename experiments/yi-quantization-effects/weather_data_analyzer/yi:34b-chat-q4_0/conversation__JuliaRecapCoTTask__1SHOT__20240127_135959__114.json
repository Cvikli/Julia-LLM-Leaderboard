[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::AbstractVector)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    mean_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Trend analysis: Check if the differences between temperatures are increasing or decreasing.\n    diffs = temps[2:end] .- temps[1:(end - 1)]  # Calculate differences\n    trend_flag = diffs[end] > 0 || (sum(abs.(diffs)) / length(diffs) < abs(mean_temp))  # Check if the last difference is positive or the average of absolute differences is less than the mean\n    trend = :stable\n    if trend_flag\n        trend = diffs[end] > 0 ? :increasing : :decreasing\n    end\n\n    return (average = mean_temp, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function `weather_data_analyzer` takes a vector of temperatures `temps` and returns a named tuple with the average, maximum, minimum temperatures, and a trend indicator. The trend is determined by looking at the differences between consecutive temperatures in the list. If the last difference is positive or if the average of the absolute differences is less than the mean temperature, we consider the data to be trending (either increasing or decreasing). Otherwise, the trend is considered stable.\n\nIf the input `temps` is an empty vector, the function returns a named tuple with all fields set to `nothing`.\n\nPlease note that if you are using Julia in a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) environment, you may need to add `using Statistics` at the beginning of the script for the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions to work correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,443],"elapsed":11.961301543,"_type":"aimessage"}]
