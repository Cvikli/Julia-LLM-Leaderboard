Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    mean_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Calculate the temperature trend using the mean of differences between consecutive elements\n    trend = if mean(diff(temps)) > 0\n        :increasing\n    elseif mean(diff(temps)) < 0\n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n\n    return (average = mean_temp, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = trend)\nend\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22]) # Example usage\n```\n\nThis function follows the given steps:\n\n1.
