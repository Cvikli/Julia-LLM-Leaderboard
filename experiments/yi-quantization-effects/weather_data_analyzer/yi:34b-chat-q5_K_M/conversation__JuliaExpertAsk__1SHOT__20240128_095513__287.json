Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    # Calculate the trend using first-order differences (simple method for this example)\n    diffs = [x - y for x in temps[2:end], y in temps[1:(end - 1)]]\n    if all(diffs .> 0)  # Increasing\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(diffs .< 0)  # Decreasing\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else  # Stable\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (average = avg_temp, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = trend)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ntemps = [10, 20, 30]  # Daily temperature data\nresult = weather_data_analyzer(temps)\nprintln(\"Average temperature: \", result.average)\nprintln(\"Maximum temperature: \", result.max)\nprintln(\"Minimum temperature: \", result.min)\nprintln(\"Temperature trend: \", result.trend)\n```\n\nThis example shows a function `weather_data_analyzer` that takes a list of temperatures `temps` and returns a named tuple with the average, maximum, minimum temperatures, and a trend indicator. The trend is determined by calculating the differences between consecutive temperature values (first-order differences) and checking if they are all positive (increasing), all negative (decreasing), or have both positive and negative differences (stable). If the list is empty, the function returns a named tuple with all fields set to `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,436],"elapsed":14.2930406,"_type":"aimessage"}]
