Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{Float64})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    # Calculate statistics\n    mean_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Determine trend (not a rigorous method, for illustrative purposes only)\n    first_temp = first(temps)\n    last_temp = last(temps)\n    if first_temp > last_temp\n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif first_temp < last_temp\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (average=mean_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ntemps = [20.5, 18.9, 21.2, 23.4, 19.7, 22.0] # Hypothetical temperature data\nresult = weather_data_analyzer(temps)\nprintln(\"Average temp: $(result.average)\")\nprintln(\"Max temp: $(result.max)\")\nprintln(\"Min temp: $(result.min)\")\nprintln(\"Trend: $(result.trend)\")\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `weather_data_analyzer` that takes a vector of floating-point numbers representing daily temperatures and returns a named tuple with the average, maximum, minimum temperatures, and a trend indicator. The trend is determined based on the first and last elements of the temperature list, which is a simple but not very precise method for detecting trends. In a real-world scenario, you would likely use more sophisticated statistical methods to determine the trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,424],"elapsed":13.89520035,"_type":"aimessage"}]
