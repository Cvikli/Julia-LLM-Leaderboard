[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers).

It also performs a simple linear regression to determine if there is an increasing, decreasing, or stable trend in the data. The `β` coefficient from the linear regression is compared against a small positive/negative threshold (0.05) to decide whether the trend is significant enough to be reported as \"increasing\" or \"decreasing.\" If the slope is close to zero (within the threshold), the trend is considered \"stable.\"\n\nPlease note that the `β` threshold for determining the trend is arbitrary and can be adjusted based on the specific requirements of the task. Also, linear regression might not be suitable for all types of trends, but it's a common starting point for simple trend analysis.","status":200,"tokens":[0,501],"elapsed":18.921838031,"_type":"aimessage"}]
