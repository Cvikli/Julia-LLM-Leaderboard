The trend is determined by calculating the mean of the differences between consecutive values in the list. If the mean difference is positive, the trend is considered increasing; if it's negative, the trend is decreasing; otherwise, it's stable.\n\nIf the list is empty, the function returns a named tuple with all elements set to `nothing`. The use of `if` statement ensures that the function does not attempt to calculate statistics on an empty list.","status":200,"tokens":[0,342],"elapsed":12.725629914,"_type":"aimessage"}]
