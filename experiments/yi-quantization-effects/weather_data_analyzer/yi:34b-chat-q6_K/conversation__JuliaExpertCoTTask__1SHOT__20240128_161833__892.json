Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    # Calculate statistics\n    mean_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Determine trend (only: :increasing, :decreasing, or :stable)\n    n = length(temps)\n    prev_temp = first(temps)\n    trend = if n > 1\n        all([t > prev_temp for t in temps[2:end]]) && :increasing ||\n        all([t < prev_temp for t in temps[2:end]]) && :decreasing ||\n        :stable\n    else\n        :not_enough_data\n    end\n\n    return (average = mean_temp, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = trend)\nend\n\n# Example Usage\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22]) # Output will be a named tuple with the calculated statistics\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,277],"elapsed":10.333688912,"_type":"aimessage"}]
