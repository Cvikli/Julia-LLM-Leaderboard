Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    average_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    std_dev = std(temps)\n    \n    # Checking trend using standard deviation as a measure of dispersion\n    if std_dev == 0.0\n        trend = :stable  # No change if all temperatures are the same\n    elseif max_temp - min_temp > 2 * std_dev\n        trend = :increasing  # Trend is increasing if difference between max and min is large compared to standard deviation\n    elseif min_temp - max_temp > 2 * std_dev\n        trend = :decreasing  # Trend is decreasing if difference between min and max is large compared to standard deviation\n    else\n        trend = :stable  # No clear trend if the differences are not significant\n    end\n\n    return (; average=average_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22]) # Example usage\n```\n\nPlease note that the `trend` analysis is subjective and depends on how you define a significant change in temperature. The above code uses a simple heuristic based on the standard deviation as a measure of dispersion. This is not a formal statistical test but rather a quick way to determine if there is a clear increasing, decreasing, or stable trend in the data.","status":200,"tokens":[0,384],"elapsed":14.37294924,"_type":"aimessage"}]
