The trend is determined by looking at the differences between consecutive temperatures in sorted order. If all differences are positive, it's considered increasing; if all differences are negative, it's decreasing; otherwise, it's stable. If the list is empty, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,330],"elapsed":12.278906827,"_type":"aimessage"}]
