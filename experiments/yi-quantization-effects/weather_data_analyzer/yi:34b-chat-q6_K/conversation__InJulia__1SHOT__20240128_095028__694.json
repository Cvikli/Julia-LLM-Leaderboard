It also determines a trend based on the standard deviation and whether the mean temperature is above or below the midpoint between the maximum and minimum temperatures. The threshold for considering an increase or decrease as a trend can be adjusted as needed.\n\nIf the list is empty, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. When you call the function with a non-empty list of temperatures, it will return a named tuple containing the statistical results and the determined trend.","status":200,"tokens":[156,534],"elapsed":20.117912207,"_type":"aimessage"}]
