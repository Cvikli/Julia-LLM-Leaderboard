Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::AbstractVector)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n    mean_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    if std(temps) == 0\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif diff(sort(temps)) > 0.0 for i in 2:length(temps)\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n    return (average=mean_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Statistics` package to compute the mean and the maximum and minimum values of the given temperature data. For the trend analysis, it assumes that if there is no variation in the temperatures (i.e., standard deviation is 0), the trend is stable. If all consecutive differences between sorted temperatures are positive, the trend is increasing; otherwise, it's decreasing.","status":200,"tokens":[0,263],"elapsed":9.783426437,"_type":"aimessage"}]
