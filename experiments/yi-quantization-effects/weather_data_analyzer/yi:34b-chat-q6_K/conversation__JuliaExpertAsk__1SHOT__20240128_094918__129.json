Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    mean_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    std_dev = std(temps)\n    variance = var(temps)\n\n    # Determine trend using simple moving average with a window size of 3\n    moving_average = [mean([temps[i], temps[i+1], temps[i+2]]) for i in 2:length(temps)-2]\n    is_increasing = all(a -> a > mean_temp, moving_average)\n    is_decreasing = all(a -> a < mean_temp, moving_average)\n    is_stable = !(is_increasing || is_decreasing)\n\n    return (; average=mean_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=(is_increasing ? :increasing : is_decreasing ? :decreasing : :stable))\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ntemps = [20, 21, 19, 23, 25]\nresult = weather_data_analyzer(temps)\nprintln(\"Average temperature: $(result.average)\")\nprintln(\"Maximum temperature: $(result.max)\")\nprintln(\"Minimum temperature: $(result.min)\")\nprintln(\"Temperature trend: $(result.trend)\")\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Statistics` package to calculate the mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures from the provided list of daily temperatures `temps`. It also calculates the standard deviation and variance for additional statistical information. To determine the temperature trend, it computes a simple moving average with a window size of 3 and checks if the temperatures are consistently increasing, decreasing, or stable compared to the overall mean.","status":200,"tokens":[186,455],"elapsed":17.169174092,"_type":"aimessage"}]
