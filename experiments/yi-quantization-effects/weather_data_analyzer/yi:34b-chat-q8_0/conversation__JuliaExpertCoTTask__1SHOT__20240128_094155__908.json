Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Given the task and the provided data, I would proceed as follows:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    # Calculate average temperature\n    avg_temp = mean(temps)\n\n    # Calculate maximum and minimum temperatures\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Determine the temperature trend using a simple method (e.g., check if first temp is lower than last)\n    n = length(temps)\n    first_temp = temps[1]\n    last_temp = temps[end]\n    if first_temp < last_temp\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif first_temp > last_temp\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (average=avg_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n\n# Example usage with the provided data\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n```\n\nPlease note that this is a simple example and does not include error handling or more sophisticated methods for determining the trend.
