Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n    \n    mean_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Calculate trend using simple linear regression (slope of the line)\n    x = 1:length(temps)\n    y = temps\n    coefs = linreg(x, y)\n    slope = coefs[2]\n    \n    if slope > 0.05 && slope < -0.05 # Adjust these values based on your use case\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif slope > 0\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n    \n    return (average = mean_temp, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = trend)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ntemps = [25.0, 30.1, 28.4, 31.9]  # This is an example list of temperatures\nresult = weather_data_analyzer(temps)\nprintln(\"Average temperature: \", result.average)\nprintln(\"Maximum temperature: \", result.max)\nprintln(\"Minimum temperature: \", result.min)\nprintln(\"Temperature trend: \", result.trend)\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Statistics` package to calculate the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures from the list of daily temperatures. For the trend analysis, a simple linear regression is performed using the `linreg` function provided by Julia's standard library. The threshold values for determining an increasing, decreasing, or stable trend are arbitrary and should be adjusted based on the specific requirements of the application.","status":200,"tokens":[0,431],"elapsed":19.440836612,"_type":"aimessage"}]
