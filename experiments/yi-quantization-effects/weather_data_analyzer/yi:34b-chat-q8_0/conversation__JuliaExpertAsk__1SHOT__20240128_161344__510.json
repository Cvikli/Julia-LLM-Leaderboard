It also calculates the standard deviation (`std`), which is used to determine the trend in the temperature data. If there is no variation (i.e., the standard deviation is 0), the trend is considered stable; otherwise, it is determined based on whether the maximum temperature exceeds the minimum.","status":200,"tokens":[0,283],"elapsed":12.730813231,"_type":"aimessage"}]
