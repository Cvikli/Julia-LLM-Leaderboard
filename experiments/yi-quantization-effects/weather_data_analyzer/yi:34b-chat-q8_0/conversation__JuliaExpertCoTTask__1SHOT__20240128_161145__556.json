Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    mean_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    # Determine trend by looking at the differences between consecutive elements\n    diffs = [t - tprev for (t, tprev) in zip(temps[1:end-1], temps[2:end])]\n    if all(diffs .> 0) || all(diffs .< 0)\n        trend = ifelse(all(diffs .> 0), :increasing, :decreasing)\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    return (average=mean_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])  # Example output\n```\n\nPlease note that the `weather_data_analyzer` function does not perform any sophisticated trend analysis. It merely looks at the differences between consecutive temperatures to determine if there is an increasing, decreasing, or stable trend. If all differences are positive, it's an increasing trend; if all differences are negative, it's a decreasing trend; otherwise, it's considered a stable trend. For real-world applications, more sophisticated methods would be used to analyze the trend.","status":200,"tokens":[290,357],"elapsed":25.971878195,"_type":"aimessage"}]
