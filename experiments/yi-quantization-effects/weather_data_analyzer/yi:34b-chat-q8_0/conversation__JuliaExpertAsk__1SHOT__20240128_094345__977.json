The trend is determined based on the standard deviation: if there's no variation in the data (i.e., the standard deviation is zero), then the trend is stable; otherwise, if the mean temperature falls within the range of one standard deviation from the maximum and minimum temperatures, the trend is also considered stable. If the mean temperature is outside this range, it suggests an increasing or decreasing trend, which we arbitrarily determine by comparing the mean to the maximum or minimum temperature.","status":200,"tokens":[0,375],"elapsed":16.901973427,"_type":"aimessage"}]
