If it is, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. If not, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using functions from the `Statistics` package. To determine the trend, we calculate the differences between consecutive elements in the temperature list and count how many are positive or negative. Depending on whether the number of positives or negatives is greater than half the length of the list, we assign an increasing, decreasing, or stable trend.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the first element of `temps` is the starting point for calculating differences, which might not be appropriate if `temps` represents a rolling dataset where the first element could represent the current day's temperature and subsequent elements are previous days' temperatures. In such cases, you would need to adjust the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,621],"elapsed":28.066917788,"_type":"aimessage"}]
