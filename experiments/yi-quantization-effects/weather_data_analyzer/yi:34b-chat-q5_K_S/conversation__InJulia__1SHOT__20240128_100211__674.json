Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package).

It also determines whether the temperature trend is increasing, decreasing, or stable by comparing each temperature to the last one until it finds a change in direction or if the list is too short for a clear pattern to emerge. If the list is empty, the function returns `nothing` for all values in the named tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,482],"elapsed":15.400492182,"_type":"aimessage"}]
