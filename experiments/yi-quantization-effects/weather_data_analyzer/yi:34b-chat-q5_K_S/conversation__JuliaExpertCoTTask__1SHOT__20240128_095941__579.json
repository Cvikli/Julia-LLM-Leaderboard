Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    daily_stats = mean(temps), maximum(temps), minimum(temps)\n    avg, max, min = daily_stats\n\n    # Determine trend\n    if avg == 0 || max == 0 || min == 0\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif (max - min) / length(temps) > 1\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n\n    return (average=avg, max=max, min=min, trend=trend)\nend\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])  # Example usage\n```\n\nPlease note that the `trend` determination is subjective and based on a simple heuristic.
