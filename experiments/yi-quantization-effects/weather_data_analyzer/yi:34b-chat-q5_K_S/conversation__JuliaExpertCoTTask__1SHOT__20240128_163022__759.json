Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    # Calculate statistics\n    mean_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Determine trend (increasing/decreasing/stable) using the average as a reference point\n    if std(temps) > 0\n        trend = if mean_temp > temps[end]\n            :decreasing\n        elseif mean_temp < temps[1]\n            :increasing\n        else\n            :stable\n        end\n    else\n        trend = :stable  # No variation in the data, so it's stable\n    end\n\n    return (average = mean_temp, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = trend)\nend\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])  # Example usage\n```\n\nThis function `weather_data_analyzer` takes a list of daily temperature data and returns a named tuple with the average, maximum, minimum temperatures, and a trend indicator. If the list is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. The trend is determined by comparing the mean temperature to the first and last elements in the list, assuming that there is some variation in the data (checked using `std`). If there is no variation, the trend is considered \"stable\".","status":200,"tokens":[290,362],"elapsed":18.652232929,"_type":"aimessage"}]
