It calculates the average (`mean`), maximum (`maximum`), and minimum (`minimum`) temperatures, as well as the standard deviation (`std`) and variance (`var`). Based on these values, it determines the trend in the temperature data using a simple heuristic: if the range from the mean to the min is greater than the range from the max to the mean, the trend is considered increasing; otherwise, it's decreasing. If there's no variation in the data (i.e., standard deviation and variance are zero), the trend is considered stable. The function returns a named tuple with the calculated values for average, maximum, minimum, and the determined trend. If the list is empty, the function returns a named tuple where all values are set to `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,423],"elapsed":13.526153497,"_type":"aimessage"}]
