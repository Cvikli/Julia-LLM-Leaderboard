The trend is determined using the first difference method, which looks at the differences between each temperature value and the first value in the list. If all differences are positive or negative, it indicates an increasing or decreasing trend, respectively. Otherwise, the trend is considered stable.","status":200,"tokens":[0,323],"elapsed":10.287499346,"_type":"aimessage"}]
