Then, create an instance of this struct and define a method for `show` to display the value and unit separated by a space.\n\nHere's how you could do it:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\njulia> my_float_with_units = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nIn the `show` function, we pass an `IO` object (often just `stdout`) and the instance of `FloatWithUnits` that we want to show. We then use string interpolation to concatenate the value with the unit using a space as the separator.\n\nRemember to import `Base.show` at the beginning so that you can override the default method for `show` provided by Julia's standard library.","status":200,"tokens":[0,283],"elapsed":7.787178114,"_type":"aimessage"}]
