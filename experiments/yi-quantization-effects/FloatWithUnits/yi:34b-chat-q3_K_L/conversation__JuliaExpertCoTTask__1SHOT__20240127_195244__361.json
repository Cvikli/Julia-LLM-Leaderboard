It also overloads the `show` method from the standard library so that when you print a `FloatWithUnits` object to an output stream (like `stdout`), it will display the value followed by a space and then the unit.\n\nTo use this new type, you can create instances of `FloatWithUnits` and then call `show` or `print` on them:\n\n```julia\njulia> FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n\njulia> println(FloatWithUnits(2.5, \"kilograms\"))\n2.5 kilograms\n```\n\nThis will output the value and unit as specified in the `show` method.","status":200,"tokens":[197,271],"elapsed":25.034612094,"_type":"aimessage"}]
