The `show` method is a special function that allows you to control how an object of a certain type is displayed when printed to the console or when used in other contexts where its string representation is needed (like in plots or tables).\n\nHere's how you can define the `show` method for your `FloatWithUnits` struct:\n\n```julia\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\nend\n```\n\nThis `show` method takes an `IO` object (often just `stdout`) and a `FloatWithUnits` instance as arguments. It then prints the value followed by a space and the unit to that stream.\n\nNow you can use your `FloatWithUnits` type in your code, and when you print it, it will display the value and unit separated by a space:\n\n```julia\njulia> my_float_with_units = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nRemember to import `Base.show` if you are using Julia 0.7 or later, as the standard library has been split into multiple packages:\n\n```julia\nimport Base: show\n```\n\nThis ensures that your `show` method will override the default one provided by Julia's base types.","status":200,"tokens":[0,377],"elapsed":29.280901598,"_type":"aimessage"}]
