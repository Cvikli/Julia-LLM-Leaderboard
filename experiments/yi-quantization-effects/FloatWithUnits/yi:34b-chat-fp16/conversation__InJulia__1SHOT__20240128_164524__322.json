It then prints the value followed by a space and the unit using `print()` which is a convenience function for writing to an `IO` stream.\n\nRemember that when you define a custom `Show` method, it overrides the default behavior of printing the struct's field names and values. The default behavior can be useful for debugging purposes, so if you want to keep that functionality, you might consider making your `show` method more complex or using an explicit `print_header` method to print the header only once.","status":200,"tokens":[0,320],"elapsed":24.789933698,"_type":"aimessage"}]
