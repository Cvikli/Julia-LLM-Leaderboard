Define the struct with its fields.\n2. Override the default `show` method by defining a new function with the same name as the type (i.e., `show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)`). This function will take an `IO` object (like `stdout`) and the instance of `FloatWithUnits` you want to print.\n3. Implement the logic to format the output as desired.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\nend\n```\n\nNow you can create instances of `FloatWithUnits` and use the `show` method to print them:\n\n```julia\njulia> float_with_units = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nNote that when defining a custom `Show` method, you should always call the base `print` function with an `IO` object (like `stdout`) as the first argument to ensure that the output is correctly printed to the console or other output streams.","status":200,"tokens":[0,319],"elapsed":24.742546631,"_type":"aimessage"}]
