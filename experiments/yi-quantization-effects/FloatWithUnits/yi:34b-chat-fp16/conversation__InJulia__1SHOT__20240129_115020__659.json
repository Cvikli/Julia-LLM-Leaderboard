Inside the function, you can format the output however you like and return it.\n\nFirst, let's define the `FloatWithUnits` struct:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n```\n\nNow, we can create a custom `show` method for this struct:\n\n```julia\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\nend\n```\n\nThis `show` method takes an `IO` object (which is typically `stdout`) and a `FloatWithUnits` instance as arguments. It then prints the value followed by a space and the unit to that stream.\n\nYou can test this by creating an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and calling `show`:\n\n```julia\njulia> using Base.Meta.Printf\n\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n\njulia> println(fwu)\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nThe `using Base.Meta.Printf` statement is necessary to use the `printf` function, which we use here to format the output in a nice way. The `println` function is used to print the result followed by a newline character.","status":200,"tokens":[0,350],"elapsed":27.122076399,"_type":"aimessage"}]
