Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\nend\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n1. We define a struct `FloatWithUnits` with two fields: `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`.\n2. The `Base.show` method is overloaded to display the value and unit when an instance of `FloatWithUnits` is printed.\n3. Inside the `show` method, we use `print(io, ...)` to concatenate and print the value followed by a space and then the unit.\n\nNow you can create instances of `FloatWithUnits` and they will be displayed as desired:\n\n```julia\njulia> float_with_units = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nRemember that the `show` method is defined in the `Base` module, so you need to import it with `using Base: show` or qualify the call to `show` with `Base.show` as shown above.","status":200,"tokens":[0,325],"elapsed":25.210640617,"_type":"aimessage"}]
