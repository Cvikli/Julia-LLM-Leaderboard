It then overloads the `show` method from the `Base` module to customize how instances of `FloatWithUnits` are displayed when printed to an `IO` stream. The `show` method simply concatenates the value with a space followed by the unit string.\n\nTo test this, you can write a simple function that creates and prints an instance of `FloatWithUnits`:\n\n```julia\nfunction print_float_with_units(fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    println(\"The float with units is: \", fwu)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nprint_float_with_units(FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\"))\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nThe float with units is: 1.8 meters\n```\n\nAs specified in the task, it concatenates the value and unit with a space.","status":200,"tokens":[197,299],"elapsed":39.79837586,"_type":"aimessage"}]
