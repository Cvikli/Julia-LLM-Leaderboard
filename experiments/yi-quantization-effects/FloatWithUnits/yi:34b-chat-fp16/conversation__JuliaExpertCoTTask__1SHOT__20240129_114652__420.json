It then overloads the `show` method from the `Base` module so that when an instance of `FloatWithUnits` is printed, it will display the value followed by a space and then the unit.\n\nTo test this, we can create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and print it to the console:\n\n```julia\njulia> using .MyModule  # Assuming you've defined the struct in a module called MyModule\n\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nThe output shows that the `show` method works as expected, concatenating the value and unit with a space.","status":200,"tokens":[0,256],"elapsed":19.874090352,"_type":"aimessage"}]
