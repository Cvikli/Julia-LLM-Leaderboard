The following code defines the struct and then provides an implementation of the `show` function that displays the value and unit as a string:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\nend\n```\n\nThis `show` method takes an instance of `FloatWithUnits` as well as an `IO` object (which is typically just the output stream) and prints out the value followed by a space and then the unit.\n\nYou can use this struct like so:\n\n```julia\njulia> my_float_with_units = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nThe `show` method is automatically called when printing an object to the console, which is why the output includes the formatted string representation of the struct's value and unit.","status":200,"tokens":[0,257],"elapsed":6.773849412,"_type":"aimessage"}]
