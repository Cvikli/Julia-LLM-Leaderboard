The `show` method is defined to take an instance of `FloatWithUnits` (denoted by `fwu`) and print the value followed by a space and then the unit when it's printed to any `IO` stream (such as `stdout` or a file).\n\nRemember that when defining new types in Julia, you should always implement the appropriate methods from the `Base` namespace if you want them to behave like built-in types. In this case, we implemented the `show` method from `Base` to control how instances of `FloatWithUnits` are displayed when printed to the console or saved to a file.","status":200,"tokens":[0,430],"elapsed":19.320908595,"_type":"aimessage"}]
