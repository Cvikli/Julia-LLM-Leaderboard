Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\nend\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `struct FloatWithUnits` defines a new struct type with two fields: `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`.\n- The `Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)` function is a method that takes an instance of the `FloatWithUnits` struct and prints it to an `IO` stream (which could be the console or any other output).\n- Inside the `show` method, we use `print(io, ...)` to concatenate and print the value and unit with a space in between.\n\nNow when you create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and try to display it using `println()` or by simply calling its name (which internally calls `show()`), it will output the value and unit separated by a space:\n\n```julia\njulia> float_with_units = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nNote that when defining the struct, I used the `::` type annotation to specify the types of the fields, which is recommended for clarity and can be useful for static typing checks in Julia 1.6 and later versions.","status":200,"tokens":[0,387],"elapsed":17.38449052,"_type":"aimessage"}]
