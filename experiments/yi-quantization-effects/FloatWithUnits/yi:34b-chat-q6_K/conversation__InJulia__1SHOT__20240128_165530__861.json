The first argument, `io::IO`, is an output stream (like `STDOUT`) where the representation of the object will be printed. The second argument is the instance of `FloatWithUnits` that we want to print.\n\n3. `print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)`: This function call prints the value and unit separated by a space. It first prints the `value` field, then a space character (`\" \"`), and finally the `unit` field.\n\nNow you can use your custom `show` method like this:\n\n```julia\njulia> FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nWhen you print an instance of `FloatWithUnits`, the output will be formatted as \"value unit\", where `value` and `unit` are taken from the fields of the struct.","status":200,"tokens":[0,397],"elapsed":14.721144771,"_type":"aimessage"}]
