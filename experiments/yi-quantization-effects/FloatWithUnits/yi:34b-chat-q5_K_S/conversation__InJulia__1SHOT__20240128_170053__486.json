The `IO` type represents any stream where bytes can be written to (e.g., `STDOUT`). The `fwu::FloatWithUnits` is a type parameter that specifies that this method should only be called for instances of the `FloatWithUnits` struct.\n\nNow you can use your custom `show` method:\n\n```julia\njulia> using Printf # For formatting with \"%\"\n\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n\njulia> println(fwu)\n1.8 meters\n\njulia> printf(\"The value is: %f\\n\", fwu) # Using printf to format the output\nThe value is: 1.800000\n```\n\nIn the `printf` example, you can see that the custom `show` method does not affect the formatting when using `printf` directly with floating-point numbers.\n\nRemember to include `using Printf` if you want to use formatted printing with `printf` or similar functions like `sprintf` and `format`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,422],"elapsed":13.395118863,"_type":"aimessage"}]
