The `show` method is used to format and print the object when it is passed to the `print` function or similar functions. Here's how you can define the `show` method:\n\n```julia\nimport Base.show\nfunction show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\nend\n```\n\nThis `show` method takes an `IO` object (often just `stdout`) and a `FloatWithUnits` instance as arguments. It then prints the value followed by a space and the unit to the output stream.\n\nNow you can use this struct and its `show` method:\n\n```julia\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n\njulia> println(fwu)\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nThe output will correctly display the value and unit separated by a space.","status":200,"tokens":[0,283],"elapsed":8.211704321,"_type":"aimessage"}]
