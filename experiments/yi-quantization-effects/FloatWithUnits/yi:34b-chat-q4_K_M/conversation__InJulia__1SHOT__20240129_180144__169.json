Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\n# Define the FloatWithUnits struct\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\n# Override the show method\nBase.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits) = print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\n```\n\nNow, when you create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and call `print` or `display` on it, the value and unit will be printed with a space between them. For example:\n\n```julia\njulia> float_with_units = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n\njulia> println(float_with_units)\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nMake sure to import `Base.show` if you're defining your function outside of the global scope (e.g., inside a module) so that it can be called on any `IO` stream:\n\n```julia\nmodule MyModule\n    using Base: show\n\n    # ... rest of your code here ...\nend\n```\n\nThis will ensure that the custom `show` method is available throughout your module or script.","status":200,"tokens":[0,334],"elapsed":9.642904259,"_type":"aimessage"}]
