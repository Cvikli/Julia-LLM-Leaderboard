Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\nend\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- The `struct` definition creates a new type `FloatWithUnits` with two fields: `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`.\n- The `Base.show` function is defined within the same scope as the `FloatWithUnits` struct to customize how instances of this struct are displayed when printed.\n- The `IO` argument in the `show` method is an object that represents the output stream (e.g., `stdout`).\n- The `print` function is used to write the value and unit separated by a space to the output stream.\n\nNow, when you create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and print it using `println()` or `display()`, it will be formatted as \"1.8 meters\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,302],"elapsed":8.73690785,"_type":"aimessage"}]
