We define a new struct `FloatWithUnits` with two fields: `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`.\n\n2. The `Base.show` method is overridden to provide custom printing behavior when an instance of `FloatWithUnits` is displayed. The `IO` argument is a standard input/output stream (often just `stdout`), and the `fwu::FloatWithUnits` is a type annotation that specifies the expected type of the object being printed.\n\n3. Inside the `show` method, we use the `print` function to write out the value followed by a space and then the unit. The `print` function automatically handles formatting and outputting the values to the stream `io`.\n\nNow you can create instances of `FloatWithUnits` and they will be displayed in the desired format:\n\n```julia\njulia> FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nRemember that when defining a custom `show` method, you should always call the parent `show` method using `super` if you want to preserve the default behavior for types that are not explicitly handled by your new method. However, in this simple case, we're only interested in printing instances of our own type, so there's no need to call `super`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,409],"elapsed":11.814909046,"_type":"aimessage"}]
