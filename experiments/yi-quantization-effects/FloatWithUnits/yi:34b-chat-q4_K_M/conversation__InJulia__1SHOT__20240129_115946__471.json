We define a new struct `FloatWithUnits` with two fields: `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`.\n2. We create a custom method for the `show` function, which is part of the standard library and is used to print objects to the console or other output streams.\n3. The first argument `io::IO` is an instance of an abstract type representing input/output devices (e.g., stdout).\n4. The second argument `fwu::FloatWithUnits` is the instance of our struct that we want to print.\n5. We use the `print` function to write the value and unit separated by a space to the output stream `io`.\n\nNow, when you create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and call `show` on it, it will display the value and unit as desired:\n\n```julia\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nRemember to include this code in your Julia session or a file that you load into the REPL for it to take effect.","status":200,"tokens":[0,362],"elapsed":10.445031023,"_type":"aimessage"}]
