Define the struct with appropriate fields.\n2. Override the `show` method within an anonymous function passed to `@printf` or use string interpolation.\n3. When overriding `show`, ensure that it is only called when displaying an instance of your struct (e.g., by using a pattern like `isassigned(io, :typeinfo)`).\n\nHere's how you can define the `FloatWithUnits` struct and its corresponding `show` method:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    # Check if the output stream is not an IOContext with a custom display method defined\n    if !isassigned(io, :typeinfo) || get(io, :compact, false) == true\n        # Use string interpolation to format the output\n        print(io, \"$($fwu.value) $$(fwu.unit)\")\n    else\n        # If a custom display method is defined for this type, delegate to it\n        return print_with_type(io, fwu)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nNow you can create instances of `FloatWithUnits` and use them in the REPL or other contexts where `show` is called implicitly:\n\n```julia\njulia> float_with_units = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nThe `isassigned(io, :typeinfo)` check ensures that the custom `show` method is not used when displaying an instance within another type's context where a custom display method might be defined. The `get(io, :compact, false)` check allows the `compact` option to override this behavior if it has been set for the output stream.\n\nRemember to use `@printf` or string interpolation as necessary to format the output in the desired way.","status":200,"tokens":[0,465],"elapsed":15.168000903,"_type":"aimessage"}]
