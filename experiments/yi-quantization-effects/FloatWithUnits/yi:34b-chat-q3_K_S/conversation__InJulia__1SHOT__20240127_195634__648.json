In Julia 1.6 and later, you can simplify this definition even further by using the `@printfmt` macro:\n\n```julia\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    @printfmt io \"%f %s\" fwu.value fwu.unit\nend\n```\n\nThis version uses the `@printfmt` macro from the `Printf.jl` package to format the output in a similar way to C's printf function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,319],"elapsed":8.455995323,"_type":"aimessage"}]
