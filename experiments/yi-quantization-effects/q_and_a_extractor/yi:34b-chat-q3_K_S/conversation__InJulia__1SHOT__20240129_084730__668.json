[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can write the function to extract questions and answers from a markdown-formatted text:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regex pattern for extracting questions and answers\n    pattern = raw\"^(?:# Question[\\s\\S]*?)(# Answer[\\s\\S]*)\"m\n    # Split the markdown into blocks\n    blocks = split(md, \"\\n\\n\")\n    # Initialize result tuple\n    result = Tuple{String, String}[]\n    # Extract questions and answers from each block\n    for (i, block) in enumerate(blocks)\n        # Strip leading whitespace and newlines\n        block = replace(block, r\"^\\s+\" => \"\")\n        # Match question and answer patterns\n        match = match(pattern, block)\n        if match !== nothing\n            question = strip(match.captures[1][2:end])\n            answer = strip(match.captures[2][2:end])\n            push!(result, (question, answer))\n        end\n    end\n    # Return the result tuple\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nNow you can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Markdown Text\n## Question 1\nWhat is the capital of France?\n# Answer 1\nParis\n\n# Question 2\nWho wrote Romeo and Juliet?\n# Answer 2\nWilliam Shakespeare\n\"\"\"\n\n# Extract questions and answers from the markdown text\nqas = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(qas)  # Print the extracted tuples of questions and answers\n```\n\nThis function assumes that there is a header with `# Question` followed by any amount of whitespace or non-whitespace characters, and then it looks for a header with `# Answer` immediately after. It uses capturing groups to extract both the question and the answer, stripping leading whitespace from both.","status":200,"tokens":[0,459],"elapsed":12.718476497,"_type":"aimessage"}]
