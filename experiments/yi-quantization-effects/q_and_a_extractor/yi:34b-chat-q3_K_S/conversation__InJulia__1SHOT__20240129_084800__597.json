It then extracts the text between each pair of questions and answers, strips leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text, and returns a tuple containing arrays of question texts and answer texts.\n\nNote that this function assumes that there are no nested headers within the question and answer sections, and that the markdown is formatted in a way where each \"# Question\" is followed by an \"# Answer\". If this assumption does not hold, additional logic would be needed to correctly identify and extract the desired text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,518],"elapsed":14.384025996,"_type":"aimessage"}]
