[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    questions = findall(r\"^(?:# Question\\n+)\", md)\n    answers = findall(r\"^(?:# Answer\\n+)\", md)\n\n    return map((q, a) -> (strip(readuntil(md, q + \"\\n\")), strip(readuntil(md, a + \"\\n\"))), questions, answers[2:end])  # Assuming there's always at least one question and answer pair\nend\n```\n\nThe `readuntil` function is used to read the markdown string until the specified pattern is found. The `strip` function removes leading whitespace and newlines from the extracted text. The range `questions[1]` is skipped because it would be the title of the first question, which we don't want to return as part of the answer. Similarly, the first element in `answers` is also skipped for the same reason.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Title\n\n## Question 1\nThis is the question text.\n\n## Answer 1\nThis is the answer text. It can span multiple lines.\n\n## Question 2\nAnother question here.\n\n## Answer 2\nAnd here's the corresponding answer.\n\n# Footer\nThis is the footer, it should be ignored.\n\"\"\"\n\npairs = q_and_a_extractor(md)\n@show pairs == (Pair{String, String}(\"Question 1\\n This is the question text.\\n\", \"Answer 1\\n This is the answer text.
