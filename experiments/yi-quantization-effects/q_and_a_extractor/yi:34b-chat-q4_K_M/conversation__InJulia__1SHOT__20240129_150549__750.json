Here's an example of how you might implement such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n    current_question = \"\"\n    current_answer = \"\"\n\n    # Loop over each line in the markdown text\n    for line in split(md, '\\n')\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            # If we encounter a new question header, save the current answer if it's not empty\n            if !isempty(current_answer)\n                push!(answers, strip(current_answer))\n            end\n            current_question = strip(line[10:end]) # Strip leading spaces and \"# Question\"\n            current_answer = \"\"\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            # If we encounter a new answer header, save the current question and answer if they're not empty\n            if !isempty(current_question) && !isempty(current_answer)\n                push!(questions, current_question)\n                push!(answers, strip(current_answer))\n            end\n            current_question = \"\"\n            current_answer = \"\"\n        else\n            # If it's neither a question nor an answer header, append the line to the appropriate buffer\n            if !isempty(line) # Ignore empty lines\n                if isempty(current_question)\n                    error(\"Unexpected content before a question: $line\")\n                elseif isempty(current_answer)\n                    current_answer *= line\n                else\n                    error(\"Unexpected content after both a question and an answer: $line\")\n                end\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Handle the final question and answer if they were not followed by another header\n    if !isempty(current_question) && !isempty(current_answer)\n        push!(questions, current_question)\n        push!(answers, strip(current_answer))\n    end\n\n    # Return the questions and answers as a tuple\n    return (questions, answers)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses `split` to break the markdown text into lines, then iterates over each line. For each line, it checks if it starts with `\"# Question\"` or `\"# Answer\"` using `startswith`. If a line starts with `\"# Question\"`, the current answer is saved if it's not empty, and the new question is stored. Similarly, for lines starting with `\"# Answer\"`, the current question and answer are saved if they're not empty.\n\nAny other non-empty lines are appended to either the current question or answer buffer, depending on which header was most recently encountered. The function also handles the case where there is no more content after a question and answer pair by checking if `current_question` and `current_answer` are not empty when the loop ends.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the markdown text is well-formed, meaning that each `# Question` header is followed by at least one non-empty line before a `# Answer` or another `# Question` header, and vice versa for answers. If the text does not follow this structure, the function may produce unexpected results or error out.\n\nTo use this function, you would call it with your markdown text as an argument:\n\n```julia\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Markdown Example\n\n## Question 1\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n- Paris\n\n## Answer 1\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\n## Question 2\nWho wrote Romeo and Juliet?\n\n- William Shakespeare\n\n## Answer 2\nWilliam Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestions, answers = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\n```\n\nThis would give you a tuple `(questions, answers)` where `questions` is a vector of questions and `answers` is a vector of corresponding answers.","status":200,"tokens":[0,959],"elapsed":28.130196418,"_type":"aimessage"}]
