Here's how you could implement such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = Array{Tuple{String, String}, 1}()\n    cur_question = \"\"\n    cur_answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    # Loop over each line in the markdown text\n    for line in split(md, '\\n')\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            if in_answer\n                push!(questions, (cur_question, cur_answer))\n            end\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n            cur_question = strip(line[10:end]) # Strip leading spaces and \"# Question\"\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            if in_question\n                in_question = false\n                in_answer = true\n                cur_answer = \"\"\n            end\n        else\n            if in_question\n                cur_question *= '\\n' * strip(line) # Append line to current question, stripping leading spaces\n            elseif in_answer\n                cur_answer *= '\\n' * strip(line) # Append line to current answer, stripping leading spaces\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    # If the last section was a question, add it to the result\n    if in_question\n        push!(questions, (cur_question, cur_answer))\n    end\n\n    return questions\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses `startswith` to check if a line begins with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". It maintains two states: `in_question` and `in_answer`, which are used to determine whether to append text to the current question or answer. The `strip` function is used to remove leading spaces from each line before appending it to the current question or answer.\n\nThe function returns a vector of tuples, where each tuple contains a question and its corresponding answer. If the last section in the markdown text is a question without an answer (or vice versa), the function still includes that partial Q&A pair in the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,539],"elapsed":15.738332734,"_type":"aimessage"}]
