It appends each line to the respective arrays until it finds the next section header. The `strip` function is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from each line before appending it to the array. Finally, the function joins the questions and answers into a single string and returns them as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[131,255],"elapsed":7.535995878,"_type":"aimessage"}]
