[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    answers = Array{Tuple{String, String}, 1}()\n    current_answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    # Loop through each line in the markdown text\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            # Start of a new question\n            in_question = true\n            current_question = strip(line[9:end]) # Strip leading spaces and '# Question'\n            current_answer = \"\"\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            # Start of a new answer\n            in_answer = true\n            current_answer = \"\"\n        elseif in_question && !in_answer\n            # Append to the current question\n            current_question *= \"\\n\" * line\n        elseif in_answer\n            # Append to the current answer\n            current_answer *= \"\\n\" * line\n        end\n\n        # If we're at the end of a question and answer pair, add it to the result\n        if startswith(line, \"#\") && !in_question && !in_answer\n            answers = [tuple(current_question, current_answer)]\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = false\n        end\n    end\n\n    return answers\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating through each line of the markdown text `md`. When it encounters a line starting with `# Question`, it starts building a new question string and sets a flag to indicate that we're in a question section. When it encounters a line starting with `# Answer`, it starts building an answer string and sets a flag to indicate that we're in an answer section. All other lines are either appended to the current question or answer, depending on which mode we're in.\n\nOnce the loop finishes, all complete questions and answers pairs are added to the `answers` array and returned.","status":200,"tokens":[11,476],"elapsed":13.751096942,"_type":"aimessage"}]
