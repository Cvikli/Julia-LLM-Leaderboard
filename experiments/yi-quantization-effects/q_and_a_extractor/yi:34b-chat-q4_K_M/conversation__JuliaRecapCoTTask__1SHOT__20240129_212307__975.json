[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

It initializes two empty arrays `questions` and `answers` to store the questions and answers respectively.\n2. It iterates over each line in the markdown text `md` using `eachline()`.\n3. If a line starts with `# Question`, it creates an empty array `question` to store the question text.\n4. If a line starts with `# Answer`, it stores the current question and creates an empty array `answer` to store the answer text.\n5. For all other lines, it checks if they belong to the question or answer block and adds them accordingly.\n6. After iterating over all lines, it appends the last question and answer to their respective arrays.\n7. Finally, it joins the questions and answers into strings separated by newlines and returns them as a tuple.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no nested `# Question` or `# Answer` headers within the same block. If such cases exist, additional logic would be required to handle them correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,558],"elapsed":16.50251557,"_type":"aimessage"}]
