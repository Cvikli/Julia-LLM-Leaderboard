It uses regular expressions to identify the start of each question and answer section and then iterates over each line in the markdown text, trimming leading spaces and adding the lines to the corresponding arrays. The function also ensures that there is a matching question for every answer and vice versa.","status":200,"tokens":[0,642],"elapsed":18.732208307,"_type":"aimessage"}]
