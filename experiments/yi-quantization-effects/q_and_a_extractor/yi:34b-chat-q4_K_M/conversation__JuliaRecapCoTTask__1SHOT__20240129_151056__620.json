[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

It then ensures that there is a corresponding answer for each question and vice versa. The text between each `# Question` and its corresponding `# Answer` is extracted, along with any remaining text after the last `# Answer`. Leading spaces and newlines are stripped from each extracted piece of text. Finally, the questions and answers are paired up into tuples.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is a one-to-one correspondence between questions and answers, and that the markdown text is well-formed with exactly one `# Question` followed by one `# Answer`, repeated as needed. If the markdown text does not adhere to this structure, the function will raise an error.","status":200,"tokens":[0,521],"elapsed":15.37587196,"_type":"aimessage"}]
