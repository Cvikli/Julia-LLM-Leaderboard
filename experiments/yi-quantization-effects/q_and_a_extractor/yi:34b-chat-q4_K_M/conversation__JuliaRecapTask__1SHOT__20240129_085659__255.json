[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = Regex(r\"^#\\sQuestion\\s+(.*?)(?:\\n|$)\", \"m\")\n    answers = Regex(r\"^#\\sAnswer\\s+(.*?)(?:\\n|$)\", \"m\")\n    \n    questions_and_answers = [(match(questions, line) for line in eachline(md))..., \n                             (match(answers, line) for line in eachline(md))...]\n    \n    questions = [q.captures[1] for q in questions_and_answers if q !== nothing]\n    answers = [a.captures[1] for a in questions_and_answers if a !== nothing]\n    \n    return [(strip(question), strip(answer)) for (question, answer) in zip(questions, answers)]\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by using regular expressions to match the `# Question` and `# Answer` headers in the markdown text. It then extracts the content after each header using the `captures` method of the matches. The resulting list is then stripped of leading spaces and newlines, and returned as a tuple of questions and answers.","status":200,"tokens":[0,292],"elapsed":8.578125432,"_type":"aimessage"}]
