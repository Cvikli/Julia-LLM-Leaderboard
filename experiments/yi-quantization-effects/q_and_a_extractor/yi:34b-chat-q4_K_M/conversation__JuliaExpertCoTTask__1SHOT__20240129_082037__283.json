It then extracts the text following each heading, removes leading whitespace and newlines, and returns a tuple with the question and answer. If there is an incorrect number of questions and answers or if a question does not have an answer, the function prints an error message and returns `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,471],"elapsed":13.754566628,"_type":"aimessage"}]
