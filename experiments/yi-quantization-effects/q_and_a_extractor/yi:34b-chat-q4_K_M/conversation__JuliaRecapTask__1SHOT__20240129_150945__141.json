[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n    current_section = :none\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if occursin(\"# Question\", line)\n            current_section == :question && push!(questions, strip(takewhile(x -> !occursin(\"#\", x), lines[nextind(lines):end])))\n            current_section = :question\n        elseif occursin(\"# Answer\", line)\n            current_section == :answer && push!(answers, strip(takewhile(x -> !occursin(\"#\", x), lines[nextind(lines):end])))\n            current_section = :answer\n        end\n    end\n    return (questions[1], answers[1])\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a state machine to keep track of whether it's in the `:question` or `:answer` section. It iterates over each line of the markdown text and strips leading whitespace and newlines from the extracted text. If a line contains \"# Question\", it starts collecting lines until another header is encountered (\"# Answer\" or \"# Question\"). Similarly, for \"# Answer\", it collects the following lines until the end of the section.\n\nThe `takewhile` function is used to ensure that we only take lines that do not start with a hash character, which are the actual content of the question or answer sections. The `nextind(lines):end` range is used to iterate over the remaining lines after the current header line without including the header itself.\n\nThe function returns a tuple containing the first question and its corresponding answer. If there are multiple questions and answers, only the first pair is extracted.","status":200,"tokens":[0,407],"elapsed":11.977768176,"_type":"aimessage"}]
