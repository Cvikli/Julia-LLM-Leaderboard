It then iterates over each section, looking for `# Question` and `# Answer` headers. When a `# Question` header is found, it reads until the next non-empty section or the end of the document, collecting the question text. For `# Answer` headers, it appends the answer text to the previously collected question. The function returns a vector of tuples `(question, answer)` for each valid question-answer pair.","status":200,"tokens":[0,454],"elapsed":13.182698389,"_type":"aimessage"}]
