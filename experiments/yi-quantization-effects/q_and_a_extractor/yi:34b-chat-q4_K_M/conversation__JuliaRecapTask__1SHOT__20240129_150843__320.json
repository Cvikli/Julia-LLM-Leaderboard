[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n    current_block = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if occursin(\"# Question\", line)\n            in_question = true\n            current_block = strip(line, '\\n')\n            continue\n        end\n        if occursin(\"# Answer\", line)\n            in_answer = true\n            current_block = strip(line, '\\n')\n            continue\n        end\n        if in_question\n            questions += [current_block]\n            in_question = false\n        elseif in_answer\n            answers += [current_block]\n            in_answer = false\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (questions[1], answers[1])\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each line of the markdown text and checking if it starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`. If so, it strips the leading whitespace and newline characters from the current block of text (which is an empty string at the beginning) and either adds it to the list of questions or answers. Once a question or answer section is complete, the corresponding list is updated with the collected text.\n\nThe `eachline` function is used to iterate over the lines of the markdown text, which is a string (`AbstractString`) in this case. The `occsin` function checks if a substring occurs within a given line. If the line starts a new question or answer section, the current block of text is updated with the stripped line content.\n\nFinally, after iterating over all lines, the first element from each list (since we are assuming only one question and one answer per document) is returned as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,413],"elapsed":12.152428083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
