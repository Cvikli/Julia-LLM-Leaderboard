[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

It then extracts the text between each pair of these headers, stripping leading spaces and newlines from both the question and answer. The result is a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains a question and its corresponding answer.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\n# Another Question\nWho wrote Hamlet?\n\n# Another Answer\nHamlet was written by William Shakespeare.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestions_and_answers = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(questions_and_answers) # Output: [(\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\"), (\"Who wrote Hamlet?\", \"Hamlet was written by William Shakespeare.\")]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,475],"elapsed":14.064233882,"_type":"aimessage"}]
