Here's an example of how you might implement such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Use a regular expression to match lines starting with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\"\n    questions = r\"^# Question\\s+([^\\n]+)\"m\n    answers = r\"^# Answer\\s+([^\\n]+)\"m\n\n    # Initialize an empty list for questions and answers\n    questions_and_answers = Vector{Tuple{String, String}}()\n\n    # Iterate over the markdown text and extract questions and answers\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        # Check if the line matches the question pattern\n        m1 = match(questions, line)\n        if m1 !== nothing\n            question = strip(m1.captures[1])\n            # Append the question to the list\n            push!(questions_and_answers, (question, \"\"))\n        end\n\n        # Check if the line matches the answer pattern\n        m2 = match(answers, line)\n        if m2 !== nothing\n            answer = strip(m2.captures[1])\n            # Look for subsequent lines that are not empty and append them to the answer\n            while !isempty(strip(line))\n                append!(answer, \"\\n\")\n                append!(answer, line)\n                line = next_non_blank_line(md, findnext(r\"^\\s*#|$\\n?\", line).offset + 1) # Find the next non-blank line and skip it if it's a comment or blank\n            end\n            # Append the answer to the list along with the question\n            push!(questions_and_answers, (questions_and_answers[end][1], answer))\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return the questions and answers as a tuple of tuples\n    return questions_and_answers\nend\n\n# Utility function to find the next non-blank line in the markdown text\nfunction next_non_blank_line(text::AbstractString, start::Int)\n    while true\n        start = findnext(r\"^\\S\", text, start).offset\n        if start == 0 || start == length(text) + 1 # end of string or whitespace at the end\n            return \"\"\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a helper function `next_non_blank_line` to find the next non-blank line in the markdown text. The main function `q_and_a_extractor` iterates over each line of the text and uses regular expressions to match lines starting with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". When it finds a question, it strips leading whitespace and adds it to a list along with an empty answer. For answers, it appends subsequent non-blank lines until it reaches a blank line or the end of the text.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes there is at least one space after \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\" for the regular expressions to work correctly. If your markdown does not have leading spaces, you may need to adjust the regular expressions accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[101,761],"elapsed":22.457013966,"_type":"aimessage"}]
