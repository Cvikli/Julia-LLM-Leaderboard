It checks if a line starts with `# Question` or `# Answer` and updates the current block accordingly. When it finds a question or an answer section, it collects the lines until the next header is encountered. The questions and answers are then joined together with newline characters to preserve the structure.","status":200,"tokens":[143,266],"elapsed":13.222519631,"_type":"aimessage"}]
