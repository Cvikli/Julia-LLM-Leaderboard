Many people find meaning in their lives through religion, family, relationships, work, personal achievements, or by making a positive impact on the world around them. It's important to note that there is no one universally accepted answer to this question.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: $question\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $answer\")\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to detect the start of a `Question` and `Answer` section in the markdown text. It then strips leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text. The example usage demonstrates how you might call the function with some sample markdown text and print out the question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,508],"elapsed":18.917173966,"_type":"aimessage"}]
