[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

It then extracts the text following these headers, strips leading spaces and newlines, and returns a tuple containing the question and answer pairs. The tuples are stored in a list `qas`.\n\nThe `findnext(questions_or_answers, md, m.offset + m.match.length)` call searches for the next occurrence of either `# Question` or `# Answer` after the current match, which is used to determine where the answer text ends and the next question (if any) begins.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no nested `# Question` or `# Answer` sections within the markdown text. If such nested structures exist, additional parsing logic would be required to handle them correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,474],"elapsed":17.874299186,"_type":"aimessage"}]
