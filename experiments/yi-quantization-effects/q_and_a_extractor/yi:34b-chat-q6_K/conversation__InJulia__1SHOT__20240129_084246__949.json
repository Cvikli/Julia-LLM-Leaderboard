It uses regular expressions to identify the start of each section and then extracts the text between them, stripping leading spaces and newlines.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is exactly one question and answer pair per section and that the sections are separated by other types of content or empty lines. If you have more complex markdown structures, you might need to adjust the logic accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,610],"elapsed":22.781321864,"_type":"aimessage"}]
