It iterates over each line of the markdown text and appends the content to the corresponding question or answer string until it encounters another `# Question` or `# Answer` header, at which point it resets the state. The function then returns the extracted question and answer as a tuple after stripping leading spaces and newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,507],"elapsed":18.903703605,"_type":"aimessage"}]
