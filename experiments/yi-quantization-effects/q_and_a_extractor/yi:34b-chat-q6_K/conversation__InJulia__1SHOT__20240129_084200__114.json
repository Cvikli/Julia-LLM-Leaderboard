It then strips leading spaces and newlines from the question and answer text and stores them in a tuple of strings. The `next_non_empty_line` utility function is used to handle the case where the answer text may start immediately after the question header without an empty line in between.\n\nTo use this function, simply pass your markdown-formatted text as an argument:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Questions and Answers\n\n# Question 1\nWhy is the sky blue?\nBecause it's reflecting the color of the ocean.\n\n# Answer 2\nHow do you solve a Rubik's cube?\nBy turning the faces in the right order!\n\"\"\"\n\nqas = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Questions and Answers:\")\nfor (question, answer) in qas\n    println(\"Question: $question\")\n    println(\"Answer: $answer\")\nend\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nQuestions and Answers:\nQuestion: Why is the sky blue?\nAnswer: Because it's reflecting the color of the ocean.\nQuestion: How do you solve a Rubik's cube?\nAnswer: By turning the faces in the right order!\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,838],"elapsed":31.40296212,"_type":"aimessage"}]
