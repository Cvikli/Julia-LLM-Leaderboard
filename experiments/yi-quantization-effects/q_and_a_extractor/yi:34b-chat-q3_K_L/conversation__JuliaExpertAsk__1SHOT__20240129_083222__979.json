It uses the `findall` function to locate the positions of both types of headers and then extracts the text between them using `strip` to remove leading spaces and newlines. The `next` function is used to find the position of the first non-whitespace character after a pattern match, which is necessary because the matches include the hash (`#`) and any leading whitespace.","status":200,"tokens":[0,456],"elapsed":12.983043799,"_type":"aimessage"}]
