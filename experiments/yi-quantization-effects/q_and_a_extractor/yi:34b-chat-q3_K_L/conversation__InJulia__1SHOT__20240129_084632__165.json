[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that does this:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    questions = findall(\"# Question\\n\\n\", md) .+ 5 # Find all \"# Question\" and add 5 to the position (to skip the heading)\n    answers = findall(\"# Answer\\n\\n\", md) .+ 6 # Find all \"# Answer\" and add 6 to the position (to skip the heading and one extra line break)\n\n    questions_text = map(questions) do qi\n        md[qi:prev(findnext(\"\\n\\n\", qi))] # Extract text until the next blank line\n    end\n    answers_text = map(answers) do ai\n        md[ai:prev(findnext(\"\\n\\n\", ai))]\n    end\n\n    return filter((x -> length(x.question) > 0 && length(x.answer) > 0), zip(questions_text, answers_text)) # Filter out empty questions and answers\nend\n```\n\nThis function assumes that the markdown text `md` is well-formatted with each question and answer section starting on a new line with `# Question` and `# Answer` headings, respectively. The `findall` function is used to find all occurrences of these headings in the text, and then the subsequent text until the next blank line is extracted using a range of indices.\n\nThe `zip` function is used to combine the questions and answers into tuples, and finally, a filter is applied to remove any tuples where both the question and answer are empty after stripping leading spaces and newlines.\n\nPlease note that this function may need to be adapted depending on the specific formatting of the markdown text you have. For example, if there are sub-questions or sub-answers, they might not be correctly extracted with this simple approach.","status":200,"tokens":[0,438],"elapsed":12.430242739,"_type":"aimessage"}]
