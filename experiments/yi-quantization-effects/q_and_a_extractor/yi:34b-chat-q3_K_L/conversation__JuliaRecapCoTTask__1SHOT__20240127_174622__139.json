[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Markdown: parse_markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n\n    for (i, line) in enumerate(parse_markdown(md))\n        if line.level == 4 && startswith(line.text, \"Question\")\n            # Start of a new question\n            questions = [Questions{String}(strip(line.text[8:end])))\n        elseif line.level == 4 && startswith(line.text, \"Answer\")\n            # Start of a new answer\n            answers = [Answers{String}(strip(line.text[7:end])))\n        elseif line.level > 5 || (line.level == 5 && length(line.text) > 0)\n            # Body text for the question or answer\n            push!(questions, Questions{String}(strip(line.text)))\n            push!(answers, Answers{String}(strip(line.text)))\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question = questions, answer = answers)\nend\n```\n\nPlease note that the `Markdown` package is used to parse the markdown text. The function iterates over each line of the parsed markdown and checks for headers starting with \"Question\" or \"Answer\" at level 4. It then collects all subsequent lines until another header is encountered or the end of the document is reached.\n\nThe `Questions` and `Answers` types are used to group the text together, but these could be simplified further if needed. The stripping of leading spaces and newlines is done by calling the `strip()` function on each line's text.\n\nThis function returns a tuple with two elements: `question` and `answer`, both of which are vectors of strings representing the collected question and answer texts, respectively.","status":200,"tokens":[0,417],"elapsed":11.700275191,"_type":"aimessage"}]
