It uses `findall` to locate the sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, and then uses `split` and `trim` to extract the text after each heading. Finally, it returns a list of tuples containing the question and answer pairs.","status":200,"tokens":[0,281],"elapsed":7.96266518,"_type":"aimessage"}]
