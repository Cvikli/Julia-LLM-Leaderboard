[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can define a function to extract questions and answers from markdown-formatted text by looking for sections that start with `# Question` and `# Answer`. Here's how you could write such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n    current_question = \"\"\n    current_answer = \"\"\n\n    for line in split(md, '\\n')\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            current_question = strip(line, [' ', '\\n'])\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            current_answer = strip(line, [' ', '\\n'])\n        else\n            current_question *= line * \"\\n\"\n            current_answer *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    push!(questions, current_question)\n    push!(answers, current_answer)\n\n    return (questions[1] => answers[1])\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each line in the markdown text and appending to the current question or answer until it finds a `# Question` or `# Answer` line. It then adds the question and answer to their respective lists. Finally, it returns a tuple with the first question and its corresponding answer.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no nested questions or answers (i.e., each `# Question` is followed by exactly one `# Answer`). If your markdown has more complex structures, you would need to adapt this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,365],"elapsed":10.056303716,"_type":"aimessage"}]
