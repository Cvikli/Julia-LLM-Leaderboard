[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Given the markdown-formatted text `md`, we will extract all text that is part of the Question and Answer sections, which are denoted by headers starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively. The function `q_and_a_extractor` should return a tuple where the first element is the question, and the second element is the answer, with any leading spaces and newlines stripped from both.\n\nHere's how we can implement this function using the provided guidelines:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    questions = Vector{String}()\n    answers = Vector{String}()\n\n    # Regular expressions to match Question and Answer headers\n    question_header = r\"^# Question\\s*$\"\n    answer_header = r\"^# Answer\\s*$\"\n\n    # Loop through each line in the markdown text\n    for line in split(md, '\\n')\n        # Check if the current line is a question header\n        if match(question_header, line) != nothing\n            # Start of a new question, so save the previous answer if there was one\n            if length(answers) > 0\n                push!(questions, strip(answers[end]))\n                push!(answers, \"\") # Initialize the answer for the next question\n            end\n        elseif match(answer_header, line) != nothing\n            # Start of a new answer, so save the previous question if there was one\n            if length(questions) > 0\n                push!(answers, strip(questions[end]))\n                push!(questions, \"\") # Initialize the question for the next answer\n            end\n        else\n            # If neither a question nor an answer header, add to the current answer\n            if length(answers) > 0\n                append!(answers[end], line * ' ')\n            else\n                # There is no open question or answer, so this must be part of the text\n                push!(questions, strip(line))\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Remove any remaining empty questions and answers\n    questions = filter(x -> !isempty(x), questions)\n    answers = filter(x -> !isempty(x), answers)\n\n    return (first(questions), first(answers))\nend\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we use regular expressions to match the `# Question` and `# Answer` headers. We keep two vectors: one for questions and another for answers. When a question header is encountered, we save the current answer if there was one, and vice versa for answer headers. Any text that doesn't belong to either a question or an answer is added to the current open section (answers or questions).\n\nAfter processing the entire markdown text, we remove any empty elements from both vectors to ensure we only keep non-empty questions and answers. Finally, we return the first element of each vector as the extracted question and answer, respectively.","status":200,"tokens":[0,667],"elapsed":22.130614596,"_type":"aimessage"}]
