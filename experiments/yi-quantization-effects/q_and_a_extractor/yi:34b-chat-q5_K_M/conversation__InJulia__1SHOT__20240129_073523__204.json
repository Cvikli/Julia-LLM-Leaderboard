If you want to extract all questions and answers, you would need to modify the function to return a vector of tuples `[(question1, answer1), (question2, answer2), ...]` or an object with more complex structure depending on your needs.","status":200,"tokens":[0,734],"elapsed":24.142063452,"_type":"aimessage"}]
