Here's how you could implement such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = Vector{String}()\n    answers = Vector{String}()\n    current_section = \"\"\n\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question = strip(line, r\"^# Question\\s+\")\n            questions += [question]\n            current_section = question\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer = strip(line, r\"^# Answer\\s+\")\n            answers += [answer]\n            current_section = answer\n        elseif current_section != \"\"\n            text = strip(line)\n            if text != \"\"\n                current_section *= \"\\n\" * text\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return questions, answers\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Markdown Document\n\n# Question: What is the purpose of this function?\nThis function extracts questions and answers from a markdown document.\n\n# Answer: To assist in Q&A extraction.\n\n# Another Question: Can I use it for other purposes?\nPossibly, but its primary intent is for Q&A extraction.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestions, answers = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\nprintln(\"Questions:\")\nfor question in questions\n    println(question)\nend\n\nprintln(\"\\nAnswers:\")\nfor answer in answers\n    println(answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function will extract the text between `# Question` and `# Answer`, stripping leading spaces and newlines. It returns a tuple of two vectors: one containing the questions and the other containing the corresponding answers. The example usage demonstrates how to apply the function to a given markdown-formatted text.","status":200,"tokens":[101,487],"elapsed":37.840147706,"_type":"aimessage"}]
