It then extracts the text between each pair of matching questions and answers, stripping leading spaces and newlines from both the question and answer texts. The result is returned as a tuple of strings, where each tuple contains a question and its corresponding answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,387],"elapsed":30.056937857,"_type":"aimessage"}]
