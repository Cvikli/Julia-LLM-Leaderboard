[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = Vector{String}()\n    answers = Vector{String}()\n    current_section = :none\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if occursin(\"# Question\", line)\n            current_section == :question && push!(questions, strip(takewhile(x -> !occursin(\"# Answer\", x), lines[2:end])))\n            current_section = :question\n        elseif occursin(\"# Answer\", line)\n            current_section == :answer && push!(answers, strip(takewhile(x -> !occursin(\"# Question\", x), lines[2:end])))\n            current_section = :answer\n        end\n    end\n    return (questions[1], answers[1])\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each line of the markdown text `md` and keeping track of the current section (`:none`, `:question`, or `:answer`) using a state variable. When it encounters a line starting with `# Question`, it assumes the start of a new question section and strips the leading whitespace and newlines from the subsequent lines until it finds a line starting with `# Answer` or the end of the document. The same process is done for the answer section.\n\nThe function then returns the first (and only) pair of question and answer it found, as a tuple. If there are more questions and answers in the markdown text, this function will only extract the first set.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that each `# Question` is followed by exactly one `# Answer`, and that there are no nested `# Question` or `# Answer` headers within a section. If these assumptions do not hold for the provided markdown text, the function may not extract the correct information.","status":200,"tokens":[0,426],"elapsed":33.259787643,"_type":"aimessage"}]
