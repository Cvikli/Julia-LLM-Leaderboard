[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n    current_section = \"\"\n    for line in split(md, '\\n')\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            if current_section != \"\"\n                push!(answers, strip(current_section))\n            end\n            current_section = \"\"\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            current_section = line * \"\\n\"\n        else\n            current_section *= strip(line) * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    push!(answers, strip(current_section))\n    return (questions[1], answers[1])\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each line in the markdown text and checking if it starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`. If a line starts with `# Question`, any existing current section is pushed to the `answers` array (after stripping leading spaces and newlines), and the current section is reset to an empty string. When a line starts with `# Answer`, the current section is set to the line plus a newline character. All other lines are appended to the current section after stripping leading spaces and newlines.\n\nAfter processing all lines, the final answer (which may be split across multiple lines) is pushed to the `answers` array. The function then returns the first question and its corresponding answer as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,341],"elapsed":26.606240968,"_type":"aimessage"}]
