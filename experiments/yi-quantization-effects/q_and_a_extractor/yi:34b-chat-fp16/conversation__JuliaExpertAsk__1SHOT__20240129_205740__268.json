It then parses the markdown text using Julia's `Markdown.parse()` function, which is not included in the standard library but can be installed via `Pkg.add(\"Markdown\")`. The `findall()` function is used to find all occurrences of these patterns in the parsed markdown content. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the question and answer text with leading spaces and newlines stripped.","status":200,"tokens":[0,276],"elapsed":21.437239123,"_type":"aimessage"}]
