Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can write a function to extract questions and answers from markdown-formatted text by looking for sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`. Here's how you could implement such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = Vector{String}()\n    answers = Vector{String}()\n    current_section = :none\n\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if occursin(\"# Question\", line)\n            current_section == :question && push!(questions, strip(take!(answers)))\n            current_section = :question\n        elseif occursin(\"# Answer\", line)\n            current_section == :answer && push!(answers, strip(take!(questions)))\n            current_section = :answer\n        else\n            if current_section == :question\n                push!(questions, strip(line))\n            elseif current_section == :answer\n                push!(answers, strip(line))\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (questions[1], answers[1])\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by keeping track of the current section (`:none`, `:question`, or `:answer`) and using a state machine to extract text from each section. The `take!` function is used to remove the first element from a vector, which in this case is the question or answer that was just processed.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use this function with some markdown-formatted text:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Markdown Text\n\n## Question\nWhy was six afraid of seven?\n\nBecause seven eight (ate) nine!\n\n## Answer\nSeven is a prime number and has a reputation for being unlucky. The joke plays on the similar sound of the words \"ate\" and \"eight,\" suggesting that seven ate (killed) nine.","status":200,"tokens":[0,445],"elapsed":34.54643782,"_type":"aimessage"}]
