[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n    current_section = :none\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if occursin(\"# Question\", line)\n            current_section == :question && push!(questions, strip(takewhile(x -> !occursin(\"# Answer\", x), lines[i+1:end])))\n            current_section = :question\n        elseif occursin(\"# Answer\", line)\n            current_section == :answer && push!(answers, strip(takewhile(x -> !occursin(\"# Question\", x), lines[i+1:end])))\n            current_section = :answer\n        elseif current_section == :question || current_section == :answer\n            push!(current_section == :question ? questions : answers, line)\n        end\n    end\n    return (questions[1], answers[1])\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a state machine to keep track of whether it's in the `:question` or `:answer` section. It strips leading spaces and newlines from each line before processing them. The `takewhile` function is used to ensure that we only extract text until the next section header (`# Question` or `# Answer`).\n\nThe `strip(takewhile(x -> !occursin(\"# Answer\", x), lines[i+1:end]))` part is a bit tricky but it's necessary to ensure that we don't include the section header in our extraction. It takes all the lines from the current line (excluding the current line itself) until the next occurrence of `# Answer` and returns everything before that, stripping leading whitespace from each line.\n\nThe function assumes that there is at most one question and one answer per document. If more questions or answers are present, it will only extract the first set.","status":200,"tokens":[0,448],"elapsed":34.983352884,"_type":"aimessage"}]
