[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

When sunlight enters our atmosphere, it collides with molecules in the air and scatters in different directions. The shorter-wavelength blue light is scattered more than longer-wavelength red light because it has a greater chance of being deflected by particles. This is known as Rayleigh scattering.\n\n## Question 2\nWhat is the speed of sound?\n\n## Answer 2\nThe speed of sound in dry air at standard temperature (0°C) and pressure is approximately 331 meters per second. This can vary with changes in temperature, humidity, and altitude.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestions_and_answers = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\n# questions_and_answers will be a vector of tuples like `[('Why is the sky blue?', 'The sky appears blue because of the way light from the sun interacts with the Earth\\'s atmosphere.'), ('What is the speed of sound?', 'The speed of sound in dry air at standard temperature (0°C) and pressure is approximately 331 meters per second.
