When it finds a question or answer header, it prepares to collect the corresponding text until the next header is encountered. The strip function is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from each line before pushing it into the respective array. Finally, it returns the first question and answer as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[131,265],"elapsed":20.585906977,"_type":"aimessage"}]
