It uses regular expressions to find sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, then extracts the text after these headers by matching the pattern with the rest of the text and capturing the first group (the text that follows). Finally, it zips the question texts with the answer texts and collects them into a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,294],"elapsed":22.79925705,"_type":"aimessage"}]
