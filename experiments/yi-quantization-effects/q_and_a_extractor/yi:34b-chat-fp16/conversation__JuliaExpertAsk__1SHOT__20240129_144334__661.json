It uses `eachline` to iterate over each line of the markdown text and updates the state accordingly. The `strip` function is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text, and `take!` is used to extract the entire block of text for a given section before moving on to the next one.","status":200,"tokens":[0,288],"elapsed":22.337102724,"_type":"aimessage"}]
