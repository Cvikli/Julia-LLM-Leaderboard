It then strips leading whitespace and newlines from the matched texts and returns a tuple of questions and answers. The regex for matching `# Question` allows for up to 6 hashes, as Markdown headers can be of different levels. The same applies to `# Answer`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,346],"elapsed":26.844582192,"_type":"aimessage"}]
