The following function defines two patterns: one for questions and another for answers. It then uses these patterns to find all matches in the text, strips leading spaces and newlines, and returns a tuple of questions and answers.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = r\"^# Question\\s*?\\n([^\\n]+)\"m\n    answers   = r\"^# Answer\\s*?\\n([^\\n]+)\"m\n    \n    question_texts = match.(questions, md).captures\n    answer_texts   = match.(answers, md).captures\n    \n    # Check if there are questions and answers present in the text\n    if length(question_texts) == 0 || length(answer_texts) == 0\n        return ()\n    end\n    \n    # Make sure the number of questions matches the number of answers\n    if length(question_texts) != length(answer_texts)\n        println(\"Number of questions does not match the number of answers.\")\n        return ()\n    end\n    \n    # Extract the text from each question and answer section\n    questions = map(q -> strip(String(q)), question_texts)\n    answers   = map(a -> strip(String(a)), answer_texts)\n    \n    # Return a tuple of questions and answers\n    return zip(questions, answers)\nend\n```\n\nTo use this function, you would call it with your markdown-formatted text `md` as an argument:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Questions\n## Q1\nWhat is the meaning of life?\n## Q2\nWhy did the bicycle fall over?\n\n# Answers\n## A1\nLife's purpose is a philosophical question that has been debated for centuries. There is no single, universally agreed-upon answer. Many people find meaning in their lives through religion, personal relationships, careers, or creative pursuits. The search for meaning is unique to each individual and can change over time.\n## A2\nThe bicycle fell over because it was two-tired! (Get it?
