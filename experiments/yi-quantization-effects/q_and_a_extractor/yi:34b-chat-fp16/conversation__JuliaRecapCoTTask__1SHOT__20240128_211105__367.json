X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Given your special instructions, I'll proceed to implement the `q_and_a_extractor` function. Please note that if you provide a markdown text without specific questions and answers formatted as instructed, the function will return an empty tuple. Here's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Parse the markdown into an AbstractDict{AbstractString, Any}\n    doc = parse(Markdown.MD, md)\n\n    # Check if there are questions and answers in the document\n    if !haskey(doc, \"# Question\") || !haskey(doc, \"# Answer\")\n        return ()\n    end\n\n    # Extract all question and answer sections\n    questions = get(doc, \"# Question\", [])\n    answers   = get(doc, \"# Answer\",   [])\n\n    # Ensure there is a matching answer for each question\n    if length(questions) != length(answers)\n        throw(DomainError(length(questions) == length(answers), \"There must be one # Answer for each # Question.\"))\n    end\n\n    # Create an empty tuple to hold the questions and answers\n    result = Tuple{String, String}()\n\n    # Loop over each question-answer pair\n    for i in 1:length(questions)\n        # Extract the text from the question and answer sections\n        question_text = strip.(questions[i].content)\n        answer_text   = strip.(answers[i].content)\n\n        # Ensure we have non-empty texts for both question and answer\n        if !isempty(question_text) && !isempty(answer_text)\n            # Add the question and answer to the result tuple\n            push!(result, (question_text[1], answer_text[1]))\n        end\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nThis function parses the markdown text using Julia's `Markdown` package and checks for sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`. It ensures that there is a matching answer for each question and then extracts the text content from these sections, stripping leading spaces and newlines. Finally, it returns a tuple of the extracted questions and answers.\n\nTo use this function, you would call it like so:\n\n```julia\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Question\nThis is a question.\n\n# Answer\nThis is the answer to the question.\n\"\"\"\n\nanswers = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\nprintln(answers)\n```\n\nIf the provided markdown text does not contain sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, or if there are no matching pairs, the function will return an empty tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,640],"elapsed":50.017878603,"_type":"aimessage"}]
