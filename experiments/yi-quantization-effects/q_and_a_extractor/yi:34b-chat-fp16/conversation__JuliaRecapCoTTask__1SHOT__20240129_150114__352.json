[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Given the task and special instructions provided, here is a function that extracts questions and answers from a markdown-formatted text `md` following the specified format:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n    current_section = :none\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if occursin(\"# Question\", line)\n            current_section == :question && push!(questions, strip(takewhile(x -> !occursin(\"# Answer\", x), lines[2:end])))\n            current_section = :question\n        elseif occursin(\"# Answer\", line)\n            current_section == :answer && push!(answers, strip(takewhile(x -> !occursin(\"# Question\", x), lines[2:end])))\n            current_section = :answer\n        end\n    end\n    return (questions[1], answers[1])\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses `split` to convert the markdown text into a list of lines (`lines`). It then iterates over these lines and checks for the start of a new question or answer section using the specified headings. If a new question is detected, it strips any leading spaces and newlines from the subsequent lines until the `# Answer` heading is encountered. Similarly, when an answer section starts, it extracts the text until the next `# Question` or the end of the document.\n\nThe function ensures that only the first question and its corresponding answer are extracted by using array indices 1 and 2 for questions and answers, respectively. If there are multiple questions and answers in the markdown text, this function will only extract the first pair.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes a well-formed markdown document with each question followed by an answer without any other headings or content interrupting the Q&A structure. It also does not handle nested lists or complex markdown structures within the questions and answers.\n\nTo use this function, simply call it with your markdown text `md` as an argument:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nSome question text...\n\n# Answer\nSome answer text...\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: $question\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $answer\")\n```\n\nThis will output the question and its corresponding answer as stripped of leading spaces and newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,566],"elapsed":44.23966519,"_type":"aimessage"}]
