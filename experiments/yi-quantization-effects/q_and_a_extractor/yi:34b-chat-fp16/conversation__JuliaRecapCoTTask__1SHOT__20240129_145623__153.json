[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n    current_section = :none\n\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if occursin(\"# Question\", line)\n            if current_section != :question\n                current_section = :question\n            end\n        elseif occursin(\"# Answer\", line)\n            if current_section == :question\n                current_section = :answer\n            end\n        elseif current_section == :question\n            push!(questions, strip(line))\n        elseif current_section == :answer\n            push!(answers, strip(line))\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (join(questions, \"\\n\"), join(answers, \"\\n\"))\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each line in the markdown text and keeping track of the current section (`:none`, `:question`, or `:answer`). When a new `# Question` or `# Answer` is encountered, it updates the current section accordingly. Any lines that are not headers are either appended to the list of questions or answers depending on the current section. Finally, it joins the lists of questions and answers into strings and returns them as a tuple.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that each question and answer is separated by at least one blank line, which is a common practice in markdown. If this assumption does not hold for your specific use case, you may need to adjust the logic to handle more complex scenarios.","status":200,"tokens":[11,357],"elapsed":27.872021879,"_type":"aimessage"}]
