[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = filter(line -> startswith(line, \"# Question\"), split(md, \"\\n\"))\n    answers = filter(line -> startswith(line, \"# Answer\"), split(md, \"\\n\"))\n\n    question_map = Dict{String, String}()\n    for (q_idx, q) in enumerate(questions)\n        q = strip(q[9:end]) # Strip leading spaces and 'Question' prefix\n        a = answers[q_idx + 1] # Assumes one answer per question\n        a = strip(a[8:end]) # Strip leading spaces and 'Answer' prefix\n        question_map[q] = a\n    end\n\n    return collect(question_map)\nend\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. Splits the markdown text `md` into lines using `\\n` as the delimiter.\n2. Filters out lines that start with `# Question` to get a collection of questions.\n3. Filters out lines that start with `# Answer`, assuming one answer follows each question (based on the Special Instructions).\n4. Strips leading spaces and the `Question` prefix from each question using `strip(q[9:end])`, where 9 is the length of `\"# Question\"`.\n5. Assumes that answers follow their corresponding questions and finds the answer for each question by indexing into the collection of answers with the same index as the question plus 1 (since the first line after a `# Answer` is the actual answer).\n6. Strips leading spaces and the `Answer` prefix from each answer using `strip(a[8:end])`, where 8 is the length of `\"# Answer\"`.\n7. Creates a dictionary `question_map` that maps each question to its corresponding answer.\n8. Finally, it collects all key-value pairs from the dictionary into a tuple of tuples `(question, answer)`.\n\nTo use this function, you would simply call it with your markdown text as follows:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question 1\nSome question here.\n\n# Answer 1\nThe answer to the first question.\n\n# Question 2\nAnother question.\n\n# Answer 2\nAnd its corresponding answer.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestions_and_answers = q_and_a_extractor(md)\n```\n\nPlease note that this function assumes a well-formatted markdown document where each `# Question` is followed by an actual question and each `# Answer` is followed by an actual answer. If the document does not adhere to this structure, the function may not extract correct information.","status":200,"tokens":[415,628],"elapsed":65.911457075,"_type":"aimessage"}]
