[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Given the task and special instructions provided:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = Regex(\"^# Question\", \"m\")\n    answers = Regex(\"^# Answer\", \"m\")\n    sections = findall(x -> x isa Pair{Regex,Regex}, (questions => answers,))\n    if length(sections) == 0\n        return ()\n    end\n    question_indexes = [start(section[1]) for section in sections]\n    answer_indexes = [start(section[2]) for section in sections]\n    questions = split(md, questions)[1:end-1] # Remove the last question if it doesn't have an answer\n    answers = split(md, answers)\n    return [(strip(q), strip(a)) for (q, a) in zip(questions, answers[1:end-1])]\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find the sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`. It then splits the markdown text based on these patterns and strips leading whitespace from both the questions and answers. If there is no answer for a question, it is not included in the result tuple. The function returns a tuple of `(question, answer)` pairs where each pair has been stripped of leading spaces and newlines.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the markdown text is well-formed with one question followed by its corresponding answer, and that there are no nested questions or answers within the same section. If such cases arise, additional logic would be required to handle them correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,367],"elapsed":28.687120296,"_type":"aimessage"}]
