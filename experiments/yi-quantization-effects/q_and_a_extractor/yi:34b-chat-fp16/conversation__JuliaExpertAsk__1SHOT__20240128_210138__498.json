When a `# Question` or `# Answer` header is encountered, it pushes the current state onto the stack and starts collecting text for the corresponding question or answer. Empty lines are used as markers for the end of each section. If no questions or answers are found, the function returns `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,607],"elapsed":47.227155999,"_type":"aimessage"}]
