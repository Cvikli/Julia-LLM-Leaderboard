It uses regular expressions to identify sections starting with \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\", filters out these lines, and then pairs them up to find matching question-answer pairs. Finally, it strips any leading whitespace from the extracted text using the `remove_leading_whitespace` function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,371],"elapsed":11.813800403,"_type":"aimessage"}]
