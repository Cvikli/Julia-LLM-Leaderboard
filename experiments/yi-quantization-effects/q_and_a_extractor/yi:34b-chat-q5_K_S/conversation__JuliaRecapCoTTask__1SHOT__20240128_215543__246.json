X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

We will follow the instructions provided in the task description and any special instructions given in the `{{instructions}}` block. Let's start by defining our function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Your code goes here\nend\n```\n\nWe will use regular expressions to match and extract the questions and answers from the markdown text. Here are some steps we can take to complete the task:\n\n1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n2. Solve the Task\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct\n\n## Step 1: Recalling Useful Julia Snippets\n\nWe will need regular expression matching, string manipulation, and tuple creation. Here are some relevant Julia functions and syntax:\n\n```julia\n# String manipulation:\nstrip(str::AbstractString) # Removes leading and trailing whitespace from str\n\n# Regular expressions:\noccursin(r::Regex, s::AbstractString) # Checks if r matches a substring of s anywhere\nmatch(r::Regex, s::AbstractString) # Returns the first match for r in s or nothing\nisnothing(x) # Check if x is nothing\n\n# Tuples:\ntuple() # Create an empty tuple\npush!(t::Tuple, x) # Append x to the end of t and return the new tuple\n```\n\n## Step 2: Solving the Task\n\nWe will define a regular expression for each section header (`# Question` and `# Answer`) and use it to find all matches. For each match, we'll strip leading spaces and newlines from the text that follows until the next header or the end of the document. We'll then collect these texts into tuples.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question_re = Regex(\"^# Question\\\\s*$\", \"m\")\n    answer_re = Regex(\"^# Answer\\\\s*$\", \"m\")\n\n    questions = Vector{String}()\n    answers = Vector{String}()\n\n    for match in eachmatch(question_re, md)\n        start_index = nextind(md, match.offset, 1)\n        end_index = findnext(answer_re, md, start_index) - 1\n        question = strip(md[start_index:end_index])\n        push!(questions, question)\n    end\n\n    for match in eachmatch(answer_re, md)\n        start_index = nextind(md, match.offset, 1)\n        end_index = findnext(question_re, md, start_index) - 1\n        answer = strip(md[start_index:end_index])\n        push!(answers, answer)\n    end\n\n    return tuple(questions, answers)\nend\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n- Defines two regular expressions for matching `# Question` and `# Answer` headers.\n- For each match of `# Question`, it finds the next occurrence of `# Answer` or the end of the document and strips leading whitespace and newlines from the text in between.\n- It does the same for matches of `# Answer`.\n- Finally, it returns a tuple containing two vectors: one with questions and another with answers.\n\n## Step 3: Double-checking the Solution\n\nTo ensure our function works as expected, we should write a test that provides an example markdown text and checks if the returned tuple contains the correct questions and answers.\n\n```julia\n# Example Markdown Text\nmd_example = \"\"\"\n# Question 1\nThis is some text to be stripped.\n\n# Answer 1\nThe answer to question 1 is here.\n\n# Question 2\nAnother question.\n\n# Answer 2\nAnd the corresponding answer.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Test q_and_a_extractor function\n@testset \"q_and_a_extractor test\" begin\n    expected_questions = [\"Question 1\", \"Question 2\"]\n    expected_answers = [\"The answer to question 1 is here.\", \"And the corresponding answer.\"]\n\n    actual_result = q_and_a_extractor(md_example)\n    @test actual_result == (expected_questions, expected_answers)\nend\n```\n\nThis test ensures that our function works as expected for a sample markdown text. If the test passes, we can be confident that our function is working correctly.\n\nIn summary, we have defined a `q_and_a_extractor` function that finds and extracts questions and answers from a markdown-formatted text according to the provided instructions.","status":200,"tokens":[0,1112],"elapsed":36.155075242,"_type":"aimessage"}]
