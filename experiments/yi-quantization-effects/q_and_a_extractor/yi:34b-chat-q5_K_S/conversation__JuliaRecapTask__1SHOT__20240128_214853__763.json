[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if occursin(\"# Question\", line)\n            in_question = true\n        end\n        if occursin(\"# Answer\", line)\n            in_answer = true\n        end\n\n        if in_question && !in_answer\n            push!(questions, strip(line))\n        elseif in_answer && !in_question\n            push!(answers, strip(line))\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (questions[1], answers[1]) # Assuming only one question and answer pair\nend\n```\n\nThis function iterates over each line of the markdown text (`eachline`) and checks if a line starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`. If it does, the corresponding state variable is set to `true`. When in the \"question\" state, any lines that do not start with `#` are appended to the list of questions. Similarly, when in the \"answer\" state, lines are appended to the list of answers.\n\nAfter iterating over all lines, the function returns a tuple containing the first question and answer. This assumes there is only one question and answer pair in the markdown text; if there are multiple pairs, the function would need to be modified to handle that case.","status":200,"tokens":[0,333],"elapsed":10.741035113,"_type":"aimessage"}]
