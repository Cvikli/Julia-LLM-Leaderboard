Here's how you might implement such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = Vector{String}()\n    answers = Vector{String}()\n    \n    for line in eachline(md)\n        # Check if the line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\"\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question = strip(readuntil(md, '\\n', keep=true))\n            questions += [question]\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer = strip(readuntil(md, '\\n', keep=true))\n            answers += [answer]\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return tuple(questions[1], answers[1]) # Assuming there's exactly one of each section\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Question\nSome text that introduces the question...\n\n# Answer\nHere is the answer to the question.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\nprintln(\"Question: $question\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $answer\")\n```\n\nThis function assumes that there is exactly one `# Question` and one `# Answer` section in the markdown text. If there can be multiple questions and answers, you would need to modify the function to handle a Vector of tuples `Zip(questions, answers)` or something similar.","status":200,"tokens":[0,382],"elapsed":12.140472813,"_type":"aimessage"}]
