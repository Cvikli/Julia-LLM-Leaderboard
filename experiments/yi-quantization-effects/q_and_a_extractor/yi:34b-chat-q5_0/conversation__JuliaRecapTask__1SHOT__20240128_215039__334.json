[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

The `findall` function is used to find the positions of `\"# Question\"` and `\"# Answer\"` headers in the markdown text. We then use `strip(Markdown.text(md)[q + 8:a - 1])` to extract the question text by removing leading spaces and newlines, where `q + 8` is the starting position of the question text (assuming the header is 8 characters long), and `a - 1` is the ending position just before the answer header. The same process is applied to extract the answer text.\n\nThe resulting tuple contains both the question and the answer as strings with any leading whitespace removed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,454],"elapsed":14.663903344,"_type":"aimessage"}]
