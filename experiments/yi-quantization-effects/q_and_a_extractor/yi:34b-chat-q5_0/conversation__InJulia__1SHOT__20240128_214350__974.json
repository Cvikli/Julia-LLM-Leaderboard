It maintains a current block of text and checks for the start of new question and answer blocks. When a new question or answer starts, it saves the current content if there is any. After processing the entire text, it returns a tuple with the questions and answers, both stripped of leading spaces and newlines.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that each question is immediately followed by an answer, which may not always be the case in real-world scenarios. It also assumes that there are no nested question and answer blocks within the text. If your markdown text has more complex structures, you might need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,677],"elapsed":21.676177539,"_type":"aimessage"}]
