[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    answers = []\n    questions = []\n\n    # Loop through each line in the markdown text\n    for (i, line) in enumerate(eachline(md))\n        # Check if the current line starts a new question or answer section\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            # Start capturing the question text\n            question = \"\"\n            while !endswith(line, \"\\n\") && i < length(md) # Don't include trailing newline in questions\n                question *= line\n                i += 1\n                line = md[i]\n            end\n            questionspush(strip(question))\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            # Start capturing the answer text\n            answer = \"\"\n            while !startswith(line, \"#\") && i < length(md) # Stop when another header starts\n                answer *= line\n                i += 1\n                line = md[i]\n            end\n            strip(answer))\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (questions[1] => answer[1])\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a simple loop to iterate over each line in the markdown text. When it encounters a line starting with `# Question`, it starts capturing the question text until the end of the line or the next newline character is found. The same logic applies for capturing answer text when a line starts with `# Answer`, but this time the capture continues until another header (`#`) is encountered.\n\nThe function then returns a tuple where the first element is the stripped question and the second element is the stripped answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,387],"elapsed":12.500618189,"_type":"aimessage"}]
