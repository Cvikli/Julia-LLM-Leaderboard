[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

If there is more than one question and answer pair, the function should extract all of them into a list of tuples `[(question_i, answer_i)]` where i ranges from 1 to the number of pairs.\n3. The function must be written in a way that preserves the performance characteristics of Julia, avoiding unnecessary string allocations and ensuring efficient processing of the markdown text.\n```\n\nHere's how I would approach this task using Julia:\n\n```julia\n# Imports for Markdown parsing\nusing Markdown\nimport Markdown: parse_file\n\n\"\"\"\n    q_and_a_extractor(md::String) -> List{Tuple{String, String}}\n\nExtract questions and answers from a markdown-formatted text. The text should contain sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`. Strip leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\"\"\"\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Parse the Markdown content into an AbstractDocument object\n    doc = parse_file(md)\n\n    # Initialize the result as an empty list\n    results = []\n\n    # Iterate over all block elements in the document\n    for el in doc.block\n        if typeof(el) == Paragraph && el.text == \"# Question\"\n            # Find the corresponding answer\n            answer_el = findnext(x -> x isa Paragraph && !isempty(strip(String(x.text))), el, doc.block)\n            if answer_el !== nothing\n                # Extract the question and answer text from their elements\n                question = strip(String(el.content[1].text))\n                answer = strip(String(answer_el.content[1].text))\n\n                # Strip leading spaces and newlines from the texts\n                question = replace(question, r\"^\\s+\" => \"\")\n                answer = replace(answer, r\"^\\s+\" => \"\")\n\n                # Append the question-answer pair to the results list\n                push!(results, (question, answer))\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return the result as a list of tuples\n    return results\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Markdown` package to parse the text into an `AbstractDocument` object. It then iterates over all block elements in the document, looking for paragraphs that start with \"# Question\" and finding the corresponding \"# Answer\" paragraph (if any). The text from these paragraphs is extracted, stripped of leading spaces and newlines, and then returned as a list of tuples.\n\nThe `findnext` function is used to search for the next occurrence of a specific element type within the block content, allowing us to find the \"# Answer\" paragraph that follows each \"# Question\" paragraph.\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes that there are no nested lists or other complex structures within the question and answer sections. If such structures are present, they would need to be handled more carefully, possibly by recursively searching for the next question/answer pair within list items or other block elements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,817],"elapsed":26.523288864,"_type":"aimessage"}]
