[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

It creates two dictionaries: one for questions and another for answers. When a line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it sets the current section accordingly and adds the text to the corresponding dictionary. The stripping of leading spaces and newlines is handled within the loop by using `strip(line[9:end])` for answer texts (since \"# Answer\" has 8 characters).\n\nThe function returns a tuple of questions and answers, where each element is a pair `(question_text, answer_text)`. If there are any special instructions provided, they will be prioritized over the default behavior. In the example above, the special instructions section is left empty, so the default behavior of extracting questions and answers is applied.","status":200,"tokens":[0,558],"elapsed":18.075964927,"_type":"aimessage"}]
