Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

It uses regular expressions to identify lines that start with `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n2. It strips any leading spaces and newlines from the matched text.\n3. It extracts the questions and answers, storing them in separate vectors.\n4. It returns a tuple containing the first question and answer found in the markdown text.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is exactly one question and one answer in the `md` string, as per your specification to return a tuple `(question, answer)`. If you expect there to be multiple questions and answers, the function should be modified to return a list of tuples or a dictionary.","status":200,"tokens":[0,393],"elapsed":12.49142388,"_type":"aimessage"}]
