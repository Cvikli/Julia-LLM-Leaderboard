It then strips leading whitespace and newlines from the matched text to ensure that only the content is retained. Finally, it returns a tuple with both the question and answer for each matching pair found in the markdown text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,337],"elapsed":10.789354004,"_type":"aimessage"}]
