It then uses `findall` to find all instances of these patterns in the markdown text `md`. The resulting matches are combined into tuples and stripped of leading spaces and newlines using `strip`. Finally, it returns a vector of these tuples.","status":200,"tokens":[0,325],"elapsed":10.339863581,"_type":"aimessage"}]
