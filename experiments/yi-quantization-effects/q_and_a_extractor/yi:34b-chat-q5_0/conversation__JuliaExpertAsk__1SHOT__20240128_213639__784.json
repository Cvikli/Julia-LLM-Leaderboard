It searches for sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer` in the text. For each occurrence, it strips leading spaces and newlines from the text between these headers and appends them to the respective variables `questions` and `answers`. After processing all occurrences, it returns a tuple containing the question and answer texts.","status":200,"tokens":[0,437],"elapsed":13.941184535,"_type":"aimessage"}]
