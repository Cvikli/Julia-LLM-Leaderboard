[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Julia Snippets for Task\n\nHere are some useful Julia snippets that might be relevant for solving the task:\n\n1. Reading files:\n```julia\nusing Base.Markdown\nfile_content = read(\"path/to/md_file.md\", String)\n```\n\n2. Parsing Markdown:\n```julia\ndoc = parse(Markdown.MD, file_content)\n```\n\n3. Querying for elements in the document:\n```julia\nquestions = findall(x -> isequal(tagname(x), \"h1\") && contains(text(x), \"Question\"), doc[:block])\nanswers = findall(x -> isequal(tagname(x), \"h1\") && contains(text(x), \"Answer\"), doc[:block])\n```\n\n4. Extracting text from elements:\n```julia\nfor element in answers\n    # Remove leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text\n    answer_text = strip(String(element.content))\nend\n```\n\n5. Creating a tuple with question and answer:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(doc)\n    questions, answers = findall(..., doc[:block]), findall(..., doc[:block])\n    return [(strip(text(q)), strip(text(a))) for (q, a) in zip(questions, answers)]\nend\n```\n\n# Solution to Task\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Markdown\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md_str::AbstractString)\n    doc = parse(Markdown.MD, md_str)\n    questions, answers = findall(x -> isequal(tagname(x), \"h1\") && contains(text(x), \"Question\"), doc[:block]), findall(x -> isequal(tagname(x), \"h1\") && contains(text(x), \"Answer\"), doc[:block])\n    return [(strip(text(q)), strip(text(a))) for (q, a) in zip(questions, answers)]\nend\n```\n\n# Double-Checking the Solution\n\nTo double-check that the solution is correct, you can test it with sample markdown text and ensure that the returned tuple contains the question and answer correctly stripped of leading spaces and newlines. For example:\n\n```julia\nmd_str = \"\"\"\n# Question\nSome question here...\n\n# Answer\nSome answer here...\n\"\"\"\n\nanswers = q_and_a_extractor(md_str)\n@assert answers == [(\"Some question here...\", \"Some answer here...\")]\n```\n\nRemember to replace `\"path/to/md_file.md\"` with the actual path to a markdown file that contains questions and answers in the desired format when reading from a file.","status":200,"tokens":[0,672],"elapsed":30.586265461,"_type":"aimessage"}]
