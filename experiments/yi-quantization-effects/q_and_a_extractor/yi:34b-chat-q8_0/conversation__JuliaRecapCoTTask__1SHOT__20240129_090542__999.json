[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Given the markdown-formatted text `md`, I will write a function `q_and_a_extractor` that extracts all text in the sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively). The extracted answer will be returned as a tuple of the question and the answer, stripped of any leading spaces and newlines.\n\nHere's how I would approach this task:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Step 1: Find all questions and answers in the markdown text\n    questions = findall(r\"^# Question\\s*?\\n(.+)\", md)\n    answers = findall(r\"^# Answer\\s*?\\n(.+)\", md)\n\n    # Step 2: Ensure each question has a corresponding answer\n    if length(questions) != length(answers)\n        throw(ErrorException(\"There must be the same number of questions and answers in the markdown text.\"))\n    end\n\n    # Step 3: Create an empty tuple to store results\n    results = Tuple{String, String}[]\n\n    # Step 4: Loop over each question-answer pair and extract the text\n    for (i, question_pos) in enumerate(questions), (j, answer_pos) in enumerate(answers)\n        question = strip(md[question_pos+1:answer_pos-1]) # Strip leading spaces and newlines from the question\n        answer = strip(md[answer_pos+1:end]) # Strip leading spaces and newlines from the answer\n        push!(results, (question, answer))\n    end\n\n    # Step 5: Return the tuple of questions and answers\n    return results\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all instances of `# Question` and `# Answer` in the markdown text. It ensures that there is a one-to-one correspondence between questions and answers. The actual text content of each question and answer is stripped of leading spaces and newlines using the `strip()` function. Finally, it returns a tuple containing all extracted question-answer pairs.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the markdown text is well-formed, with exactly one `# Question` followed by one `# Answer` and so on. If there are any other headings or if the structure of the markdown text is not as expected, this function may need to be modified accordingly.\n\nTo use this function, you would call it like so:\n\n```julia\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Question 1\nSome question text.\n\n# Answer 1\nSome answer text.\n\n# Question 2\nAnother question.\n\n# Answer 2\nAnother answer.\n\"\"\"\n\nanswers = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\n```\n\nThe `answers` variable would then contain a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains the question and its corresponding answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,673],"elapsed":30.63909935,"_type":"aimessage"}]
