[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

If no special instructions are provided, I will assume a basic scenario where each question and answer is preceded by its header (i.e., `# Question` and `# Answer`) without any additional formatting or context.\n\nHere's an example of how the input markdown text might look:\n\n```markdown\n# Document Title\n\nSome text before the questions start...\n\n# Question\nWhy was six afraid of seven?\n\n# Answer\nBecause seven eight (ate) nine!\n\nMore text after the questions and answers...\n```\n\nIn this case, the output tuple would be:\n\n```julia\n(\"Why was six afraid of seven?\", \"Because seven eight (ate) nine!\")\n```\n\nPlease provide more details if your actual scenario involves different formatting or additional requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,211],"elapsed":9.565259375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
