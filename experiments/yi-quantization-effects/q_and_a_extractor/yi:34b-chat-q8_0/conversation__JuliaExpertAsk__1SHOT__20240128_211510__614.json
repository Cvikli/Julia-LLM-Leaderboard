It handles both cases where there is a blank line between the two sections and when they are on the same line. The text after each heading is stripped of leading spaces and newlines using `strip()`. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the first question and its corresponding answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,555],"elapsed":25.119566601,"_type":"aimessage"}]
