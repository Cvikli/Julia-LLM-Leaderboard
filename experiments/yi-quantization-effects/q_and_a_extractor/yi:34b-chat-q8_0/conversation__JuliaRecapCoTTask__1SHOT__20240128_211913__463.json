[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    answers = []\n    questions = []\n\n    # Find all lines starting with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\"\n    for line in split(md, '\\n')\n        line = strip(line)  # Remove leading spaces and newlines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            questions_open = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answers_open = true\n            push!(answers, \"\")  # Initialize answer buffer\n        end\n\n        # If we're in a question or answer section, append to the buffer\n        if questions_open || answers_open\n            push!(answers[end], line)\n        elseif startswith(line, \"#\")  # End of heading, so end of section\n            questions_open = false\n            answers_open = false\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Convert the buffers into strings and strip leading spaces\n    for (i, answer) in enumerate(answers)\n        answers[i] = join(answer, '\\n') |> strip\n    end\n\n    # Check for valid answers and extract questions\n    valid_answers = filter(!isempty, answers)  # Remove empty answers\n    questions = map((a -> split(a, \"\\n\")[1]), valid_answers)  # Extract question from first line of each answer\n\n    return (questions[1], valid_answers[1])  # Return the first question and its corresponding answer\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each line in the markdown text. When it encounters a `# Question` or `# Answer` line, it sets a boolean to indicate whether we're in a question or answer section. If both booleans are false, we're at the end of a heading and can reset them. Within a question or answer section, each line is appended to the corresponding buffer.\n\nAfter iterating over all lines, we have buffers for each answer. We filter out empty answers (which might occur if there's an `# Answer` without any content) and extract the questions from the first line of each non-empty answer. Finally, we return the first question and its corresponding answer.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes a well-formed markdown document with exactly one question and answer pair. It does not handle nested headings or multiple questions and answers. If you need to handle more complex cases, you would need to extend this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[11,572],"elapsed":26.089590716,"_type":"aimessage"}]
