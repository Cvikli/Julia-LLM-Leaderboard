It does this by splitting the text into lines and checking each line for the start of a new question or answer. When a new question is detected, it saves the current answer if any, and when an answer starts, it pushes an empty string to the questions list. Any subsequent lines are then appended to the corresponding list until the end of the document. Finally, it returns the first question and its corresponding answer as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,390],"elapsed":17.540479798,"_type":"aimessage"}]
