It then extracts the text between these headers by finding the next occurrence of either `## Question` or `## Answer`, or the end of the document if no such pair is found. The leading whitespace and newlines are stripped from the extracted text before it's returned in a tuple containing both the question and answer sections.","status":200,"tokens":[0,513],"elapsed":13.699015359,"_type":"aimessage"}]
