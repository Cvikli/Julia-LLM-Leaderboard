It then extracts the text between these headers by finding the positions of the first and last whitespace characters after the headers. Finally, it strips leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text before returning a tuple containing both questions and answers.","status":200,"tokens":[0,478],"elapsed":12.739475941,"_type":"aimessage"}]
