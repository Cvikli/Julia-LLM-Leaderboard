[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To extract questions and answers from a Markdown-formatted text `md` using Julia, you can use the following function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regular expressions to match headers and strip leading spaces/newlines\n    question_regex = Regex(\"^(?:\\n*|\\t*)?# Question\\n*([^\\n]+\\n*)\")\n    answer_regex = Regex(\"^(?:\\n*|\\t*)?# Answer\\n*(.*\\n+)\")\n\n    # Extract questions and answers from the markdown text\n    questions_and_answers = [(m[1] for m in match.((question_regex, answer_regex), md))]\n\n    # Ensure we have a pair of question and answer\n    if length(questions_and_answers) > 0 && length(questions_and_answers[end]) == 2\n        return questions_and_answers\n    else\n        return []\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to match the `# Question` and `# Answer` headers in the text. It then extracts the corresponding text that follows each header, stripping leading spaces and newlines using the `[^\\n]+\\n*` pattern that matches one or more non-newline characters followed by zero or more newline characters.\n\nTo use this function, simply pass your markdown text `md` to it:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage:\nmd = \"\"\"\\\n# Question\n\nSome context here...\n\n# Answer\n\nThe answer text goes here...\n\"\"\"\n\nquestions_and_answers = q_and_a_extractor(md)\n```\n\nIf the markdown text contains both a `# Question` and `# Answer` header, the function will return a tuple containing the question and answer text stripped of leading spaces and newlines. If there's no matching pair or if the text doesn't follow the expected format, it will return an empty array.","status":200,"tokens":[104,460],"elapsed":16.414037639,"_type":"aimessage"}]
