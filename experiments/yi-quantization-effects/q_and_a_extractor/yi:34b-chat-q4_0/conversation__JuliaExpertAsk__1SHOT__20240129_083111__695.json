It then extracts the text that follows each header by finding the starting index of the line where the header appears and then strips any leading whitespace from the extracted text. The output is a tuple of `(question, answer)` pairs, with each question-answer pair itself being a tuple. If no questions or answers are found, an empty tuple is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,423],"elapsed":11.459239031,"_type":"aimessage"}]
