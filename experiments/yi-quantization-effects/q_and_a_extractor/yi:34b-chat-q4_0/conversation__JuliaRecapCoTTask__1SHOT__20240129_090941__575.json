[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

It then extracts the text between these headers, strips leading whitespace and newlines, and returns a tuple of the question and its corresponding answer(s). If there are multiple answers for a single question, they are concatenated.\n\nIf you have any questions about this function or if it doesn't work as expected with your specific markdown text, feel free to ask!","status":200,"tokens":[0,637],"elapsed":17.57450917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
