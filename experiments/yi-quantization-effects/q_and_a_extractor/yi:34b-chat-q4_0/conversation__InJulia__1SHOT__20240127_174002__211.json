[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

Below is an example of how you might implement such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    # Regular expressions for matching questions and answers\n    question_pattern = r\"^# Question\\s*([^\\n]*)\"m\n    answer_pattern = r\"^# Answer\\s*(.*)$\"m\n\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n\n    # Split the markdown text into lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n\n    for (i, line) in enumerate(lines)\n        # Check if the current line starts a question or an answer\n        if occursin(question_pattern, line)\n            # Extract the question text and add it to the list of questions\n            m = match(question_pattern, line)\n            question = strip(m.captures[1])\n            questions += [question]\n        elseif occursin(answer_pattern, line)\n            # Extract the answer text and add it to the list of answers\n            m = match(answer_pattern, line)\n            answer = strip(m.captures[1])\n            answers += [answer]\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Make sure there's a question for each answer (and vice versa)\n    if length(questions) != length(answers)\n        throw(ErrorException(\"Unmatched questions and answers found.\"))\n    end\n\n    # Return the questions and answers in a tuple\n    return Tuple(zip(questions, answers))\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Markdown document example\n\n## Question 1\nSome text related to the first question.\n\n## Answer 1\nThis is the answer to the first question.\n\n## Question 2\nAnother question for you to answer.\n\n## Answer 2\nAnd here's the corresponding answer.\n\"\"\"\n\nanswers = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\nprintln(answers)\n```\n\nThis function will return a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains a question and its corresponding answer. If there is an unmatched `# Question` or `# Answer` section, the function will throw an ErrorException.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the markdown text is well-formed with matching `# Question` and `# Answer` sections. It also assumes that each question has exactly one answer directly following it. If you have more complex structures within your Markdown text, you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,620],"elapsed":16.497450869,"_type":"aimessage"}]
