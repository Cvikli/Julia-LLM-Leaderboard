[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can write a function to extract questions and answers from markdown-formatted text by looking for headers starting with \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\". Below is an example of how you might define such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = Vector{String}()\n    answers = Vector{String}()\n    current_question = nothing\n\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if occursin(\"# Question\", line)\n            # Start of a new question\n            if current_question != nothing\n                # Add the previous answer to the list\n                push!(answers, strip(current_question))\n            end\n            current_question = \"\"\n        elseif occursin(\"# Answer\", line)\n            # Start of an answer\n            current_answer = \"\"\n        else\n            # Append to current question/answer\n            current_question *= strip(line) * \"\\n\"\n            current_answer *= strip(line) * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Add the last answer and question if they are not empty\n    if current_question != nothing && length(current_question) > 0\n        push!(questions, strip(current_question))\n    end\n    if length(current_answer) > 0\n        push!(answers, strip(current_answer))\n    end\n\n    # Return the questions and answers in a tuple\n    return (questions, answers)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each line in the markdown text. When it encounters a \"# Question\" line, it starts a new question by setting `current_question` to an empty string. When it sees a \"# Answer\" line, it starts a new answer with `current_answer`. All other lines are appended to the current question or answer, stripping leading whitespace and newlines.\n\nAfter processing all lines, any remaining questions and answers are added to their respective lists and then returned as a tuple.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the markdown text is well-formed and that there are no nested headers within the question and answer sections. It also assumes that each \"# Question\" header is followed by exactly one \"# Answer\" header, without any other intervening headers.","status":200,"tokens":[0,530],"elapsed":14.375548735,"_type":"aimessage"}]
