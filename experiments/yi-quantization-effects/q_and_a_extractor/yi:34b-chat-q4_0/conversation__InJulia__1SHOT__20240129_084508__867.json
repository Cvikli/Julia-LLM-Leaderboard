The function should strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text. Here's how you could implement it:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = Vector{String}()\n    answers = Vector{String}()\n    \n    # Loop through each line of the markdown text\n    for (i, line) in enumerate(split(md, \"\\n\"))\n        if occursin(\"# Question\", line)\n            # If we find a question header, start collecting the question text\n            question_start = i\n        elseif occursin(\"# Answer\", line)\n            # If we find an answer header, end the current question and start collecting the answer\n            push!(questions, strip(join(md[question_start:i-1], \"\\n\")))\n            answer_start = i\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Ensure we have both a question and an answer\n    if length(questions) > 0 && length(answers) > 0\n        push!(answers, strip(join(md[answer_start:end], \"\\n\")))\n        return (questions[end], answers[end])\n    else\n        # If there are no questions or answers in the text, return an empty tuple\n        return ()\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating through each line of the `md` string and looking for headers starting with \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\". When it finds a question header, it starts collecting the text from that point until the next \"# Answer\" or the end of the document. Once an answer header is found, it strips any leading spaces and newlines from both the collected question and answer texts and returns them in a tuple.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no nested headers within the markdown text and that each question is followed by exactly one answer. If these assumptions do not hold true for your specific use case, you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,498],"elapsed":13.502250676,"_type":"aimessage"}]
