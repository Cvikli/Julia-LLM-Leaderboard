It maintains state for whether it's currently in an answer section, and accumulates both questions and answers as it processes each line of the markdown text.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes there is only one question and answer pair per document, which is typical for a Q&A format. If there can be multiple pairs, the function would need to be modified to handle a vector of tuples `[(question1, answer1), (question2, answer2), ...]` as the return value.","status":200,"tokens":[131,463],"elapsed":12.464911302,"_type":"aimessage"}]
