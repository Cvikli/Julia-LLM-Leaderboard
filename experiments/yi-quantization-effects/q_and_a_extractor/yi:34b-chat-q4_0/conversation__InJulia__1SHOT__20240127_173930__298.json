[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can write a function to extract questions and answers from markdown-formatted text by looking for headers starting with \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\", respectively. Here's an example of how you might implement such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = answer = \"\"\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in split(md, '\\n')\n        if occursin(\"# Question\", line)\n            question = strip(line)\n            in_answer = false\n        elseif occursin(\"# Answer\", line)\n            in_answer = true\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= strip(line) * \"\\n\"  # Append the line with leading spaces stripped\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Introduction\n\nSome text before questions.\n\n## Question: What is 2 + 2?\n\nMore text related to the question.\n\n## Answer: It's 4!\n\nEven more text after the answer.\n\n# Another Section\n\"\"\"\n\nq, a = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\nprintln(\"Question: $q\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $a\")\n```\n\nThis function will extract the question and answer sections from the provided markdown text `md`. It uses a `for` loop to iterate over each line in the text, checking for the \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\" headers. When it finds an answer header, it starts appending subsequent lines to the answer variable until another question or answer header is encountered. The function then returns a tuple with the extracted question and answer.\n\nPlease note that this example assumes there are no nested questions or answers within the same section, which means each \"# Question\" should be followed by an \"# Answer\" without any other headers in between. If your markdown text has more complex structures, you might need to modify this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,466],"elapsed":12.34759645,"_type":"aimessage"}]
