It iterates over the list and uses the `isascii` function to check if the word contains only ASCII characters. If the first character is between 'A' and 'Z' (inclusive), it means the word starts with a capital letter, and it is added to the new vector of filtered words.\n\nPlease note that this function will not work correctly for non-ASCII characters or words where the capitalization depends on the full word (e.g., \"deer\" vs. \"Deer\"). It also assumes that each word in `words` is a single ASCII character long. If you have multi-character words with mixed case, you would need to use more sophisticated string comparison methods.","status":200,"tokens":[0,401],"elapsed":12.732003739,"_type":"aimessage"}]
