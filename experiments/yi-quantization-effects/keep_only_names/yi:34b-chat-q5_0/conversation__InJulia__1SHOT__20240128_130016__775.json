This is more inclusive than just checking for the ASCII A-Z range since it includes uppercase letters from all scripts that have an uppercase/lowercase distinction.\n\nPlease note that in the example output, the original word \"Dog\" appears twice because both \"dog\" and \"cat\" are also included in the result after being converted to title case. If you want to ensure unique entries, you can use a set or make sure to only append words that aren't already present in the capitalized_words vector.","status":200,"tokens":[68,319],"elapsed":10.272317383,"_type":"aimessage"}]
