If it does, it is considered a \"name\" and is added to the `names` vector. The `occursin(' ', word)` check is used to include words that start with a space, which would also be considered as starting with an uppercase letter since spaces are not alphanumeric characters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,176],"elapsed":5.571068556,"_type":"aimessage"}]
