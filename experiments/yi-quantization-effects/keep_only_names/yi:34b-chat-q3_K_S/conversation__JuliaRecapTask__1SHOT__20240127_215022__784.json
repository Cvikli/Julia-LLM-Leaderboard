[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    uppercase_letters = [letter for letter in 'A':'Z']\n    return filter(word -> startswith(uppercase_letters, first(word)), words)\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. The `keep_only_names` function accepts a list of strings (`words::Vector{String}`) as input.\n2. It defines an array `uppercase_letters` that contains all uppercase letters ('A':'Z'). This will be used to check if the first letter of each word in the `words` list is uppercase.\n3. The function uses the built-in `filter` function to filter out words from `words` that do not start with a letter from `uppercase_letters`.\n4. The anonymous function passed to `filter` checks if the first letter of each word in the `words` list is uppercase by using the `startswith` function, which returns true if the word starts with any of the characters provided as an argument. If not, it skips that word and keeps only the words that do start with an uppercase letter.\n5. The `filter` function then returns a new vector containing only those elements from the original collection for which the predicate is true.\n\nDouble-checking:\n- The function does not modify the original list of words; it creates a new list without mutating the input.\n- It handles strings that may contain uppercase and lowercase letters, punctuation, or numbers. As long as the first letter is uppercase, the word is kept.\n- It does not rely on the case sensitivity of Julia's String type because `startswith` automatically handles case insensitivity by using the `String`'s casing information.","status":200,"tokens":[0,393],"elapsed":10.643951174,"_type":"aimessage"}]
