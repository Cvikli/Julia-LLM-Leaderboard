[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Julia Snippets\n\n```julia\n# Basic collection types\nVector{T} = Vector{T}(undef) where T\nDict = Dict{K, V} where {K, V}\nSet = Set{E} where E\n\n# String operations\nstartswith(str1, str2) -> Bool  # Checks if `str1` starts with `str2`.\nisuppercase(letter) -> Bool    # Returns true if the letter is uppercase.\n```\n\n# Task Solution\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    selected_words = Vector{String}()\n    for word in words\n        if startswith(word, uppercasefirst(word))\n            push!(selected_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return selected_words\nend\n```\n\n# Double-checking the Solution\n\nThe function `keep_only_names` iterates over a vector of strings (`words`) and checks if each word starts with an uppercase letter using `startswith(word, uppercasefirst(word))`. The `uppercasefirst(word)` function converts the first character of the word to uppercase and the rest to lowercase. If the word does start with an uppercase letter, it is added to the output vector `selected_words`. Finally, the function returns `selected_words`, which contains only words that begin with a capital letter.\n\nThe solution assumes that each word in the list is either all uppercase or all lowercase and does not account for mixed case within a word. If this assumption is incorrect, the function may need to be modified to handle such cases appropriately.","status":200,"tokens":[0,376],"elapsed":10.16193162,"_type":"aimessage"}]
