The `filter` function applies this logic to each element in the `words` list and returns only those elements for which the predicate (the anonymous function `w -> ismatch(r\"^[A-Z]\", w[1])`) returns `true`.\n\nHere's how you can use it:\n\n```julia\n# Example words\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"cat\", \"apple\"]\ncleaned_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(cleaned_words) # Output: Dog cat apple\n```\n\nPlease note that in the example provided, `\"dog\"` is not removed because it starts with a capital letter as well (assuming you're on Windows or another system where case-insensitivity applies to file systems). If you want to enforce strict case-sensitivity, you would need to modify the regex accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,305],"elapsed":8.071999151,"_type":"aimessage"}]
