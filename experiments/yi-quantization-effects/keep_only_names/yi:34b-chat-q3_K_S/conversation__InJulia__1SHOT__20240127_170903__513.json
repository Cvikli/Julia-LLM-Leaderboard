Maps each word in `words` to its uppercase first letter and an empty string if it doesn't start with a capital letter.\n2. Filters out the resulting strings that are empty after converting them back to strings.\n\nHere's how you would use this function:\n\n```julia\njulia> keep_only_names([\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"CAt\"])\n4-element Vector{String}:\n \"Dog\"\n \"Cat\"\n \"dog\"\n \"cat\"\n```\n\nPlease note that the function `keep_only_names` does not change the original list of words; it returns a new list with filtered elements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,254],"elapsed":6.716417975,"_type":"aimessage"}]
