The `uppercasefirst(word)` function is used to convert the first letter of each word to upper case so that we can compare it against the original word.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"apple\", \"Duck\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words) # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Duck\"]\n```\n\nNote that the function does not modify the original list `words`; it creates a new list and returns that.","status":200,"tokens":[0,333],"elapsed":8.822903808,"_type":"aimessage"}]
