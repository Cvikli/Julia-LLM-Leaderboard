It also checks if the first letter of the word is uppercase, regardless of whether there's a space or a dash. If neither condition is met, the word is not added to the filtered list.\n\nThe function then returns the list of capitalized names that were kept after filtering.","status":200,"tokens":[0,306],"elapsed":8.075360735,"_type":"aimessage"}]
