It uses the `isuppercasefirst` function to check if a word starts with an uppercase letter, and `push!` to add the word to the output array if it passes the check.\n\nPlease note that in Julia, words are case-sensitive by default, so \"Dog\" and \"dog\" are considered different. The `isuppercasefirst` function is used to ensure that the first character of a word is uppercase.","status":200,"tokens":[0,337],"elapsed":8.908802812,"_type":"aimessage"}]
