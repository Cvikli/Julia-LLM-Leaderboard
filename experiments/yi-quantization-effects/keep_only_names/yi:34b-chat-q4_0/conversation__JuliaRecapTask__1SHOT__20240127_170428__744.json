[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    return filter(word -> isempty(first(word)) || isspace(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\n\nHere's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:**\n   - The `filter` function can be used to filter a collection based on a predicate.\n   - The `isempty` function checks if the first character of a string is empty (i.e., a space or a non-printable character).\n   - The `isspace` function checks if the first character of a string is a whitespace character.\n\n2. **Solve the Task:**\n   - Create a function `keep_only_names` that takes in a vector of strings (`words`).\n   - Use `filter` to iterate over each word and keep only those where the first character is not empty or is a space. This will effectively remove all words that do not start with a capital letter.\n\n3. **Double-check that the solution is correct:**\n   - Test the function with some sample input data to ensure it behaves as expected.\n\nThis function does not use multiple dispatch since it operates on `String` objects uniformly. It also avoids creating an intermediate vector by using a one-liner with `filter`, which is efficient and clear.","status":200,"tokens":[379,308],"elapsed":8.479486953,"_type":"aimessage"}]
