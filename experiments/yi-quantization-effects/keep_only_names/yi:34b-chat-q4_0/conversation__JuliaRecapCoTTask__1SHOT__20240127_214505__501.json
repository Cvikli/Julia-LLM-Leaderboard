[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Step 1: Filter out words that do not start with a capital letter\n    capitalized_words = filter(word -> startsWithCapitalLetter(word), words)\n\n    return capitalize_remaining_words(capitalized_words)\nend\n\nfunction startsWithCapitalLetter(word::AbstractString)::Bool\n    # Check if the first character is a capital letter\n    return uppercase('a') <= word[1] <= uppercase('z')\nend\n\nfunction capitalize_remaining_words(capitalized_words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Capitalize all remaining words that are not already capitalized\n    uncapitalized_words = filter(word -> !startsWithCapitalLetter(word), capitalized_words)\n    capitalized_words = append!(capitalized_words, map(word -> capitalize(word), uncapitalized_words))\n\n    return capitalized_words\nend\n```\n\nPlease note that the `keep_only_names` function first filters out words that do not start with a capital letter using `startsWithCapitalLetter`. It then capitalizes any remaining uncapitalized words using `capitalize_remaining_words`, ensuring that all output words are capitalized.","status":200,"tokens":[11,308],"elapsed":8.303321326,"_type":"aimessage"}]
