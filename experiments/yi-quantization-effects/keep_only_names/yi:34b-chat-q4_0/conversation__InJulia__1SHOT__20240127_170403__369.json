If you have a different definition of what constitutes a name, you would need to adjust the logic accordingly.\n\nYou can call this function like so:\n\n```julia\nnames = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"fish\", \"Batman\"]  # Example list of words\nkept_names = keep_only_names(names)\nprintln(kept_names)  # Print the result\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n[\"Cat\", \"Batman\"]\n```\n\nRemember that `occursin` checks for the presence of a substring within a string, and `isuppercase` tests if all characters in a string are uppercase.","status":200,"tokens":[0,319],"elapsed":8.419224059,"_type":"aimessage"}]
