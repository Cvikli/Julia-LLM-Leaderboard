The result is returned as a vector of strings.\n\nHere's how you can use the function:\n\n```julia\n# Example words list\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"rat\", \"tree\", \"Bat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output will be: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Bat\"]\n```\n\nPlease note that the `startswith` function in Julia is case-sensitive by default. If you want to match both uppercase and lowercase letters, you should convert the entire word to lowercase or use a case-insensitive comparison.","status":200,"tokens":[0,328],"elapsed":10.673454598,"_type":"aimessage"}]
