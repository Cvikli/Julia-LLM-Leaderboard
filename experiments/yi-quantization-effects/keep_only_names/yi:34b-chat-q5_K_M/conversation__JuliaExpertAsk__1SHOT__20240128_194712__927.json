For each word, it checks if the first character is uppercase using the `startswith` function with the uppercased first letter as the check. If the condition is met, the word is added to the new vector. Finally, the new vector is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,166],"elapsed":5.391021233,"_type":"aimessage"}]
