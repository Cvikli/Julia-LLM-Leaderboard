[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String}) :: Vector{String}\n    # Create an empty vector to store the filtered words\n    names = Vector{String}()\n    \n    # Iterate over each word in the list\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the first character of the word is uppercase\n        if startswith(word, uppercase(first(word)))\n            # Add the word to the new vector if it passes the check\n            push!(names, word)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return names\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a `Vector{String}` as input and returns another `Vector{String}` with only those words that start with a capital letter. It does this by iterating over the original list of words and using the `startswith` function to check if each word starts with an uppercase character. If it does, the word is added to a new vector. Finally, the new vector is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,219],"elapsed":7.205446857,"_type":"aimessage"}]
