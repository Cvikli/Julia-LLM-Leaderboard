The `uppercasefirst` function is used to convert the first character of each word to uppercase so that we can compare it correctly.\n\nThe `startswith` function checks if the string starts with the given prefix, in this case, the uppercased first character of the word. If it does, the word is kept; otherwise, it is filtered out.","status":200,"tokens":[0,254],"elapsed":8.245982281,"_type":"aimessage"}]
