If it does, it means the word begins with a capital letter and is therefore added to the new list. The `uppercasefirst` function is used to capitalize the first letter of each word so that \"mouse\" would be compared to \"Mouse\", for example.\n\nWhen you run this code, you should see:\n\n```plaintext\nFiltered list: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Mouse\"]\n```\n\nNote that the function does not modify the original list; it returns a new list with only the names that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,352],"elapsed":11.448695531,"_type":"aimessage"}]
