The `uppercasefirst` function is used to capitalize the first letter of each word, as `startswith` requires the prefix to be uppercase for comparison. If the condition is met, the word is added to the new array using `push!`.\n\nPlease note that this function does not handle words that are entirely in uppercase or lowercase, which might not match their own capitalized versions. It also assumes that each word in the list is a valid name that should be kept if it starts with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[68,346],"elapsed":11.410279806,"_type":"aimessage"}]
