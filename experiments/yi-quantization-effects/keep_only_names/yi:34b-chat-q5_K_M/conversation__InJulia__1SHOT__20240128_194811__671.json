It does this by iterating over each word and checking if the first character is in its uppercase form. If it is, the word is added to the new vector.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"mouse\", \"Elephant\", \"apple\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words) # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, the function `keep_only_names` is applied to a list of words, and it returns a new list containing only \"Cat\" and \"Elephant\" because those are the only two words that start with a capital letter. The other words (\"dog\", \"mouse\", \"apple\") are not included in the output.","status":200,"tokens":[0,375],"elapsed":12.209906549,"_type":"aimessage"}]
