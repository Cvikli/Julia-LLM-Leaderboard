It does this by checking if the first character of each word is uppercase and also ensuring that the word is not just its own uppercase version (to avoid duplicates).\n\nThe `occsin` function is used to check if a substring exists within a string. In this case, we're checking for the existence of the uppercase letter 'a' because it covers all possible lowercase letters in English. This is a simple trick to ignore case when matching patterns.","status":200,"tokens":[0,421],"elapsed":13.709713498,"_type":"aimessage"}]
