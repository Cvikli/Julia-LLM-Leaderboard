The condition for the filter is checking if the word starts with its first character in uppercase (`uppercasefirst(word)`) and then comparing it to the original word using `startswith`. This ensures that we only keep words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,205],"elapsed":6.682301339,"_type":"aimessage"}]
