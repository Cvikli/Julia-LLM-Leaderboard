Then, it iterates over each word in the `words` list and uses `startswith()` to check if the word starts with a capital letter (which is determined by comparing the word with its first character converted to uppercase). If the condition is met, the word is added to the `capitalized_words` vector using `push!()`.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `capitalized_words` vector which contains only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[68,270],"elapsed":8.936982357,"_type":"aimessage"}]
