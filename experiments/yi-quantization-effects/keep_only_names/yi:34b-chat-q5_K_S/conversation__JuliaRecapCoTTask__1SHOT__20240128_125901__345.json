[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"## Julia Snippets to Recall\n\n- `isupper(x)`: Check if a character is uppercase.\n- `map(f, collection)`: Apply a function `f` to each element of a collection.\n- `filter(predicate, collection)`: Create a new collection by filtering out elements for which the predicate is false.\n\n## Solution\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Filter words that do not start with an uppercase letter\n    uppercase_words = filter(w -> isupper(w[1]), words)\n\n    return uppercase_words\nend\n```\n\n## Double-checking the Solution\n\nThe `keep_only_names` function uses `filter` to create a new collection of words where each word starts with an uppercase letter. The `isupper(w[1])` checks if the first character of each word is uppercase, and only those words are kept.\n\nThis solution is concise and efficient, as it does not modify the original list directly and avoids unnecessary allocations by using higher-order functions like `map` and `filter` from Julia's standard library.\n\nIf there are any special instructions provided, they would be applied here:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Special Instructions go here\n    uppercase_words = filter(w -> isupper(w[1]), words)\n\n    return uppercase_words\nend\n```\n\nRemember to replace `{{instructions}}` with the actual special instructions provided.","status":200,"tokens":[0,344],"elapsed":11.078371664,"_type":"aimessage"}]
