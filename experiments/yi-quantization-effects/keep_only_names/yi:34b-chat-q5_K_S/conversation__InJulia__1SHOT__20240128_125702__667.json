It does this by iterating over each word in the list and checking if the first character is uppercase using a regular expression. If it is, the word is appended to a new list; otherwise, it is ignored. Finally, the new list of capitalized words is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,317],"elapsed":10.040711239,"_type":"aimessage"}]
