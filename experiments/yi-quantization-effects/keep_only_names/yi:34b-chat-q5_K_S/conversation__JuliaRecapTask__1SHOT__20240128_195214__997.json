[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Initialize an empty vector to hold the filtered words\n    filtered_words = Vector{String}(undef, 0)\n\n    # Iterate over each word in the list\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the word starts with a capital letter\n        if isascii(word[1]) && isuppercase(word[1])\n            # If yes, add it to the filtered list\n            push!(filtered_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\n### Step 1: Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this task\n- `isascii` to check if a character is ASCII.\n- `isuppercase` to check if a character is uppercase.\n- `Vector{String}(undef, 0)` to create an empty vector of strings (this is more efficient than `Vector{String}()`).\n- `push!` to add elements to the end of a vector.\n\n### Step 2: Solve the task\n- The function `keep_only_names` takes a vector of strings `words` and returns another vector containing only those words that start with a capital letter.\n- Inside the for loop, we check if the first character of each word is ASCII and uppercase using `isascii(word[1]) && isuppercase(word[1])`.\n- If the condition is met, we add the word to the filtered list using `push!(filtered_words, word)`.\n- The function returns the filtered list of words at the end.\n\n### Step 3: Double-check that the solution is correct\n- The function correctly filters out words that do not start with a capital letter without modifying the original list.\n- It handles empty lists and lists containing only non-capitalized words by returning an empty vector.\n- Performance should be good since we're only iterating over the input once.","status":200,"tokens":[0,442],"elapsed":14.269632236,"_type":"aimessage"}]
