The `first(w)` function returns the first character of a string, and `uppercase` converts a single character to uppercase. The `push!` function appends an element to the end of an array.\n\nThe `keep_only_names` function takes a list of words (`words`) as input and returns a new list containing only those words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,346],"elapsed":10.967027502,"_type":"aimessage"}]
