[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # 1. Create an empty vector to store the filtered words\n    filtered_words = Vector{String}()\n\n    # 2. Iterate over the provided list of words\n    for word in words\n        # 3. Check if the word starts with a capital letter\n        if ismatch(r\"^[A-Z][a-z]*$\", word) # Regular expression to matchcapitalized words\n            # 4. If it does, add it to the filtered list\n            push!(filtered_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `keep_only_names` takes a vector of strings (`words`) and returns a new vector containing only those words that start with a capital letter.\n- In line 2, an empty vector is created to store the filtered words.\n- The function iterates over each word in the list using a `for` loop (line 3).\n- On each iteration, it uses a regular expression `r\"^[A-Z][a-z]*$\"` to match words that start with a capital letter and contain only lowercase letters after that (line 4).\n- If the word matches the pattern, it is added to the filtered list using `push!` (line 5).\n- Finally, the function returns the filtered list of words (line 6).\n\nThis solution does not use any Julia standard libraries beyond the regular expression support built into Base Julia. It is optimized for clarity and readability while still maintaining performance by avoiding unnecessary allocations.","status":200,"tokens":[379,374],"elapsed":12.285964032,"_type":"aimessage"}]
