The regular expression `r\"^[A-Z]\"` matches any word that starts with an uppercase letter from A to Z. If the condition is met, the word is added to the `capitalized_words` array using `push!`. Finally, the function returns this array of filtered words.","status":200,"tokens":[0,298],"elapsed":9.452293256,"_type":"aimessage"}]
