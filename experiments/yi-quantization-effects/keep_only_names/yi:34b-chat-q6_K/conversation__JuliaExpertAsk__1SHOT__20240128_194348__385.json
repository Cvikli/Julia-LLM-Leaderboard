It checks if the first letter of the word is capitalized using the `startswith` function with the uppercase version of the first character. If it matches, the word is pushed onto the `capitalized_words` vector. After the loop, `capitalized_words` contains only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[98,216],"elapsed":8.162450891,"_type":"aimessage"}]
