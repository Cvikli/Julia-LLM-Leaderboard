[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Start by creating an empty list to store the filtered words\n    filtered_words = Vector{String}()\n\n    for word in words\n        if startswith(word, uppercase(word[1]))  # Check if the word starts with a capital letter\n            push!(filtered_words, word)     # If so, add it to the filtered list\n        end\n    end\n\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses `startswith` to check if each word in the list begins with an uppercase character. The `uppercase` function is used to convert the first letter of the word to uppercase so that we can compare it against the original, which may or may not be uppercase. If the word starts with a capital letter, it is added to the `filtered_words` vector using `push!`.\n\nThe function returns `filtered_words`, which contains only those words from the original list that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,228],"elapsed":8.546562923,"_type":"aimessage"}]
