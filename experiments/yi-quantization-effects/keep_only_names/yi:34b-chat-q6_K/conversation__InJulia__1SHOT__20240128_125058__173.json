It does this by iterating over each word and checking if the first character is uppercase. If it is, the word is added to the new array; otherwise, it is ignored.\n\nYou can call this function as follows:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"apple\", \"Zebra\", \"pear\"]\nfiltered_names = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_names)  # Output will be something like: [\"Cat\", \"Zebra\"]\n```\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that each word is a separate element in the `words` array. If your words contain spaces or other punctuation, you would need to preprocess the input to split the words into individual elements first.","status":200,"tokens":[0,355],"elapsed":13.163563612,"_type":"aimessage"}]
