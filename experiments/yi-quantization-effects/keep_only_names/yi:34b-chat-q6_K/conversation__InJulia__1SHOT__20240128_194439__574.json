It does this by iterating over each word in the provided list and checking if the first character is in the range of uppercase letters (from 'A' to 'Z') using `occursin`. If it is, the word is appended to the `capitalized_words` array. Finally, the `capitalized_words` array is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,243],"elapsed":8.991981764,"_type":"aimessage"}]
