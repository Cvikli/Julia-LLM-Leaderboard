[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Create an empty vector to store the filtered words\n    result = Vector{String}()\n\n    # Iterate over each word in the original list\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the first character of the word is uppercase\n        if startswith(word, uppercase(word[1:1]))\n            # Add the word to the result vector if it passes the check\n            push!(result, word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses `startswith` to check if a string starts with a specific prefix. Since we want to keep only words that start with an uppercase letter, we compare the first character of the word with its uppercase version to ensure it's not a lowercase letter followed by an uppercase one (e.g., \"dog\").\n\nIf there are any Special Instructions provided, they would be included here:\n\n```julia\n# Additional code or changes based on special instructions\n```\n\nRemember to always double-check your solution for correctness and performance, especially when dealing with strings in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[11,267],"elapsed":10.079616061,"_type":"aimessage"}]
