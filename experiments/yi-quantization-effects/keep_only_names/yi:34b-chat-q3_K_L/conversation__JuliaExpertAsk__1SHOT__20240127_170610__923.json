The `startswith` function is used to check if a word starts with a specific substring (in this case, \"d\" in lowercase). To be more precise, we convert both the word and the character to lowercase before checking using `lowercase(w)` and `lowercase('D')`, respectively. This ensures that we are not comparing case-sensitively.","status":200,"tokens":[98,157],"elapsed":4.480701498,"_type":"aimessage"}]
