The predicate function checks if the beginning of the word matches the regex pattern `r\"^[A-Z]\"`, which looks for characters that are uppercase A-Z at the start of the string (^ means start of the string). This regex assumes that each word is a separate element in the list and does not handle spaces or other punctuation between words.\n\nIf you need to retain words with spaces or different separators, you would need to modify the predicate function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,188],"elapsed":4.83308529,"_type":"aimessage"}]
