[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(w -> ismatch(r\"^\\p{Lu}\", w), words)\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- We use `filter` to iteratively process each word in the list.\n- The predicate function checks if the first character of a word matches the regex `r\"^\\p{Lu}\"` using `ismatch` from the `Regex` module. This regex pattern matches characters that are classified as uppercase in Unicode (e.g., 'A' or 'B') and matches at the beginning of the string (^).\n- The `\\p{Lu}` syntax is a Unicode property escape for uppercase characters. It's a convenient way to match without specifying an explicit list of uppercase letters across all scripts.\n\nAlternative, more verbose version:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(w -> length(w) > 0 && ismatch(r\"^[A-Z]\", w), words)\nend\n```\n\nExplanation of the alternative version:\n- This version uses a regular expression that matches one or more uppercase letters from A to Z. The `length` check is used to filter out empty strings that might be captured by the regex if they are provided as part of the input list.\n\nDouble-checking:\n- Both versions of the function should correctly keep only words that start with a capital letter when applied to a list of mixed case and lowercase words.","status":200,"tokens":[0,339],"elapsed":8.870688015,"_type":"aimessage"}]
