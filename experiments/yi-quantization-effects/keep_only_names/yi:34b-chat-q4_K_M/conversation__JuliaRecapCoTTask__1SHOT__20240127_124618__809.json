[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Julia Code Solution\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Create an empty array to store the filtered words\n    names = Vector{String}()\n\n    # Iterate over each word in the list and check if it starts with a capital letter\n    for w in words\n        if isascii(w) && length(w) > 0 && uppercase(w[1]) == w[1] # Check if first character is uppercase ASCII\n            # Append the word to the names array if it passes the check\n            push!(names, w)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return names\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses `isascii` to ensure that we're only checking ASCII characters (as Unicode handling can be more complex). The `length(w) > 0` check ensures that the word is not empty, and the `uppercase(w[1]) == w[1]` checks if the first character of the word is uppercase and equal to itself (which would be true only if it's an uppercase ASCII letter).\n\n# Double-Check\n\nTo double-check that the solution is correct, we can test it with some sample data:\n\n```julia\n# Sample words list\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\", \"fish\", \"Fish\"]\n\n# Call the function and print the result\nfiltered_names = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(\"Filtered names: $filtered_names\")\n```\n\nExpected output:\n\n```text\nFiltered names: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Fish\"]\n```\n\nThe function `keep_only_names` should retain only those words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,404],"elapsed":11.615943127,"_type":"aimessage"}]
