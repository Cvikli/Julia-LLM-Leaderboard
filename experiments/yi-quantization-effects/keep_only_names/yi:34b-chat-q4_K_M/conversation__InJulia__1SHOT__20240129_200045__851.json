If the regex matches, the word is added to a new array of strings. Finally, the new array is returned as the filtered list of names.\n\nYou can test this function like so:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"mouse\", \"Fish\"]\nfiltered_names = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_names)  # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Fish\"]\n```\n\nRemember to import the `Regex` module at the beginning of your script if you haven't already done so.","status":200,"tokens":[0,310],"elapsed":8.937084338,"_type":"aimessage"}]
