Here's how you can define such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Initialize an empty array to store the filtered words\n    names = String[]\n\n    # Iterate over each word in the list\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the word starts with a capital letter\n        if ismatch(r\"^[A-Z]\", word) # or use uppercase(first(word)) == 'D' for example\n            # If yes, add it to the array of names\n            push!(names, word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return names\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression to match words that start with a capital letter. The `^` in the regex matches the beginning of the string, and `[A-Z]` matches any single character in the range A-Z (uppercase). You could also use the built-in `uppercase(first(word)) == 'D'` to check if the first letter is \"D\", for example, but this approach with a regex is more general and can handle any capitalized word.\n\nTo use this function, simply call it with your list of words:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\", \"mouse\", \"MOUSE\"]\nfiltered_names = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_names) # Output will be something like: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"MOUSE\"]\n```\n\nRemember that the `keep_only_names` function assumes that each word in the list is already separated. If your input contains a mixture of sentences or paragraphs, you would need to preprocess the text to extract individual words first (e.g., by using a whitespace regex like `r\"\\s+\"`) before applying this function.","status":200,"tokens":[68,452],"elapsed":13.221144367,"_type":"aimessage"}]
