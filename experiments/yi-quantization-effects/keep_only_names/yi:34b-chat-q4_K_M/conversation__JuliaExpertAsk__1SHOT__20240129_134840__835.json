The `uppercasefirst` function is used to capitalize the first letter of each word for comparison purposes. If the condition is met, the word is added to the `names` array. Finally, the `return` statement returns the `names` array containing only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,201],"elapsed":5.784548848,"_type":"aimessage"}]
