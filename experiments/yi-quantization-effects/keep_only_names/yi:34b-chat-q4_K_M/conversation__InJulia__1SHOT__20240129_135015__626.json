Here's how you can define such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Create an empty array to store the filtered words\n    names = Vector{String}()\n\n    # Iterate over the list of words\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the word starts with a capital letter\n        if ismatch(r\"^[A-Z]\", word)\n            # If yes, add it to the result\n            push!(names, word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return names\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to check if a word starts with a capital letter. The `ismatch` function returns a boolean indicating whether the regex matches the beginning of the string. If it does, the word is added to the `names` array. Finally, the `return` statement returns the `names` array which contains only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nYou can test this function as follows:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"mouse\", \"Mango\"]\nfiltered_names = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_names) # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Mango\"]\n```\n\nThis will print the list of filtered names.","status":200,"tokens":[0,322],"elapsed":9.293521418,"_type":"aimessage"}]
