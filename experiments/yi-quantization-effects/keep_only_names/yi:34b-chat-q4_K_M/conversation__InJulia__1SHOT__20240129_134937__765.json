If it does, the word is added to a new list of filtered words. Here's how you can define such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Initialize an empty array to store the filtered words\n    filtered_words = Array{String, 1}()\n\n    # Iterate over each word in the list and check if it starts with a capital letter\n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(first(word))  # Check if the first character is uppercase\n            push!(filtered_words, word)  # Add the word to the filtered list\n        end\n    end\n\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses `isuppercase` from the standard library to check if the first character of a string is uppercase. It then pushes the words that pass this test onto a new array, which is returned at the end of the function.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage with a list of strings\nnames = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"mouse\", \"Elephant\"]\nfiltered_names = keep_only_names(names)\nprintln(filtered_names)  # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the words are separated by spaces and does not handle punctuation or other symbols. If your list contains full sentences or phrases, you might need to preprocess the data before applying this filter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,380],"elapsed":10.965008235,"_type":"aimessage"}]
