Here's how you can define such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Initialize an empty array to store the names starting with capital letters\n    capitalized_names = Array{String, 1}()\n\n    # Iterate over each word in the list and check if it starts with a capital letter\n    for word in words\n        if ismatch(r\"^[A-Z][a-z]+\", word) # Regular expression to match capitalized names\n            push!(capitalized_names, word) # Add the word to the result array\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return the filtered list of names\n    return capitalized_names\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression `r\"^[A-Z][a-z]+\"` to match words that start with a capital letter and have at least one lowercase letter after it. The `ismatch` function checks if the pattern matches the word, and if so, the word is added to the result array using `push!`.\n\nYou can call this function on any list of strings like so:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\nnames = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"mouse\", \"Mango\"]\nfiltered_names = keep_only_names(names)\nprintln(filtered_names) # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Mango\"]\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you want to use list comprehensions (available since Julia 1.0), you can write the function like this:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return [word for word in words if ismatch(r\"^[A-Z][a-z]+\", word)]\nend\n```\n\nThis version is more concise and uses a list comprehension to filter the words directly. It's worth noting that using list comprehensions can be less efficient than the loop approach when dealing with large lists because the entire collection must be iterated over before the result is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,499],"elapsed":14.448690892,"_type":"aimessage"}]
