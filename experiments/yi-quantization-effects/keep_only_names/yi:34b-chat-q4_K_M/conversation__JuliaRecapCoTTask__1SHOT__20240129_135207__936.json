[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Given the task description and the special instructions, here's how I would approach solving this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Test # For testing purposes\n\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Initialize an empty array to store the filtered words\n    capitalized_words = Array{String, 1}()\n\n    # Iterate over each word in the list\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the word starts with a capital letter\n        if isuppercase(word[1])\n            # Append the word to the filtered array if it does\n            push!(capitalized_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return capitalized_words\nend\n\n# Test the function\nlet words = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\"]\n    filtered_words = keep_only_names(words)\n    @test filtered_words == [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\nend\n```\n\nIn this solution, I've used the `isuppercase` function to check if the first letter of each word is uppercase. If it is, the word is added to a new array. The original list is not modified; instead, a new array containing only the capitalized words is returned.\n\nThe `let` block at the end is used to test the function with an example input and ensure that the output matches our expectations. This is not part of the actual solution but is included for demonstration purposes.","status":200,"tokens":[0,328],"elapsed":9.621764873,"_type":"aimessage"}]
