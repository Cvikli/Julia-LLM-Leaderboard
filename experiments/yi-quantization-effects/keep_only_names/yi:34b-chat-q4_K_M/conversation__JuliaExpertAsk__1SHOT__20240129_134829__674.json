The `uppercasefirst` function is used to capitalize the first letter of a word for comparison purposes. If the condition is met, the word is added to the `filtered_words` vector. Finally, the `return` statement returns the filtered list of words.","status":200,"tokens":[0,203],"elapsed":5.843699532,"_type":"aimessage"}]
