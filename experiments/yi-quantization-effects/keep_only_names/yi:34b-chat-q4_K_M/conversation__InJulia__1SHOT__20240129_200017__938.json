It then filters out the words that do not match this pattern and returns an array of the remaining capitalized names.\n\nHere's how you can use the function:\n\n```julia\n# Example list of words\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"mouse\", \"Fish\"]\n\n# Apply the filter\nfiltered_names = keep_only_names(words)\n\n# Print the filtered names\nprintln(filtered_names) # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Fish\"]\n```\n\nThe function `keep_only_names` can be used on any list of strings to retain only those that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,338],"elapsed":9.769727854,"_type":"aimessage"}]
