Here's how you can define such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Initialize an empty array to store the names starting with capital letters\n    capitalized_names = Array{String, 1}()\n\n    # Iterate over each word in the list\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the word starts with a capital letter\n        if ismatch(r\"^[A-Z][a-z]*$\", word)\n            # Add the word to the new array if it matches the pattern\n            push!(capitalized_names, word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return the filtered list of names\n    return capitalized_names\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression `r\"^[A-Z][a-z]*$\"` to match words that start with a capital letter and have zero or more lowercase letters afterward. The `ismatch` function checks if the pattern matches the word, and if it does, the word is added to the new array.\n\nYou can call this function on any list of strings like so:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\nnames = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"mouse\", \"Bat\"]\nfiltered_names = keep_only_names(names)\nprintln(filtered_names)  # Output will be: [\"Cat\", \"Bat\"]\n```\n\nThis will print out the list of names that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,381],"elapsed":11.024416074,"_type":"aimessage"}]
