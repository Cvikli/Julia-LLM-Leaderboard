Here's how you can define such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Create an anonymous function (lambda) as a predicate to filter on\n    filter(word -> isstartswith(uppercase(word), uppercase(first(word))), words)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nsome_words = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"dog\", \"Mouse\"]\ncleaned_names = keep_only_names(some_words)\nprintln(cleaned_names)  # Output will be something like: [\"Dog\", \"Mouse\"]\n```\n\nIn the `keep_only_names` function, we use the `filter` function to filter out the words based on a predicate. The predicate checks if the word starts with a capital letter by using the `isstartswith` function and comparing the uppercase versions of the whole word and the first character of the word. This is to ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive.\n\nThe `first(word)` part is used to get the first character of each word, which is then converted to an uppercase letter with the `uppercase` function. The same operation is performed on the whole word as well.\n\nFinally, the `filter` function applies this predicate to the list of words (`words`) and returns a new vector containing only those elements from `words` for which the predicate returned `true`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,351],"elapsed":15.748269673,"_type":"aimessage"}]
