It does this by iterating over each word in the list and checking if it starts with its first character in upper case using the `startswith()` function along with the `uppercasefirst()` function to ensure the comparison is case-insensitive. If the condition is met, the word is added to the new list.","status":200,"tokens":[0,228],"elapsed":10.21615142,"_type":"aimessage"}]
