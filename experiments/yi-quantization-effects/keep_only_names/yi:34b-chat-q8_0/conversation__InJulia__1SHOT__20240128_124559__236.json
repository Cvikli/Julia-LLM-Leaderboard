The `Array{String}(undef, 0)` initializes an empty array of strings where each element is uninitialized (`undef`). Then, `push!` is used to add words to the array if they pass the filtering criteria.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes all input words are valid English words and do not contain uppercase letters other than at the beginning. If you want to handle more complex cases (e.g., titles like \"The Cat in the Hat\"), you might need a more sophisticated approach.","status":200,"tokens":[68,316],"elapsed":14.335407303,"_type":"aimessage"}]
