Here's how you can define such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Initialize an empty array to store the filtered words\n    capitalized_words = Array{String, 1}()\n    \n    # Iterate over each word in the list\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the first character of the word is uppercase\n        if startswith(word, uppercase(word[1]))\n            # Append the word to the new array if it's capitalized\n            push!(capitalized_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return capitalized_words\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of words (`words`) and returns a new list that contains only those words that start with a capital letter. It does this by checking if the first character of each word is equal to its uppercase version, which ensures that the word starts with an uppercase letter regardless of whether it's in title case or not.\n\nYou can call this function and pass a list of words as follows:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"apple\", \"Zebra\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Zebra\"]\n```\n\nThis will print the list of filtered words, which in this case is `[\"Cat\", \"Zebra\"]` since these are the only two names that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,386],"elapsed":17.336098006,"_type":"aimessage"}]
