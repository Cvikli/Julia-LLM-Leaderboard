For each word, it checks if the first letter is uppercase using the `isuppercase()` function. If so, the word is added to the `output` vector using `push!()`. Finally, the `return` statement returns the `output` vector with the filtered words.","status":200,"tokens":[0,190],"elapsed":8.515245283,"_type":"aimessage"}]
