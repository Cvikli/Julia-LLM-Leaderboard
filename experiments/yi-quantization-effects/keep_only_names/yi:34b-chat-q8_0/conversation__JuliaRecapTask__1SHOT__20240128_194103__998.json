[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    # Create an empty vector to hold the filtered words\n    new_words = Vector{String}()\n\n    # Iterate over each word in the list\n    for word in words\n        # If the first character is uppercase, add the word to the new list\n        if startswith(word, uppercase(first(word)))\n            push!(new_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return the new list of filtered words\n    return new_words\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses `startswith` to check if a string starts with another string (in this case, an uppercase version of its first character). The `uppercase` function is used to ensure that we're comparing against the uppercase version of the first character regardless of the case of the input word. If the condition is met, the word is added to the new list using `push!`.\n\nTo test this function:\n\n```julia\njulia> words = [\"dog\", \"cat\", \"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n4-element Vector{String}:\n \"dog\"\n \"cat\"\n \"Dog\"\n \"Cat\"\n\njulia> keep_only_names(words)\n2-element Vector{String}:\n \"Dog\"\n \"Cat\"\n```\n\nIn this example, `dog` and `cat` are removed from the list because they do not start with a capital letter, while `Dog` and `Cat` are kept.","status":200,"tokens":[379,347],"elapsed":15.971025596,"_type":"aimessage"}]
