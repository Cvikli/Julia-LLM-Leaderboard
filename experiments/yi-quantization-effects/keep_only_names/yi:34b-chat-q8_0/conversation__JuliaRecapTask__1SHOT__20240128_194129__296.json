[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Initialize an empty vector to hold the filtered words\n    names = Vector{String}()\n\n    # Iterate over each word in the list and check if it starts with a capital letter\n    for word in words\n        if occursin(r\"^[A-Z]\", word)  # Regular expression to match a capital letter at the start of the word\n            push!(names, word)  # Add the word to the filtered list if it passes the check\n        end\n    end\n\n    return names  # Return the filtered list of words\nend\n```\n\nTo test the function:\n\n```julia\nusing Test\n\n@testset \"keep_only_names\" begin\n    word_list = [\"dog\", \"cat\", \"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n    expected_result = [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n\n    actual_result = keep_only_names(word_list)\n\n    @test actual_result == expected_result\nend\n```\n\nThis function defines a regular expression to match words that start with a capital letter and uses `occsin` from the standard library's `Regex` module to check each word in the list.
