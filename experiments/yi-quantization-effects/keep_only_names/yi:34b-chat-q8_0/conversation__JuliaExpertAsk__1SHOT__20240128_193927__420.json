For each word, it checks if it starts with a capital letter using the `startswith` function combined with a range of uppercase letters ('A':'Z') to ensure case sensitivity. If the condition is met, the word is added to the `capitalized_words` vector using `push!`. After iterating over all words, the `capitalized_words` vector is returned as the filtered list.","status":200,"tokens":[0,234],"elapsed":10.499665918,"_type":"aimessage"}]
