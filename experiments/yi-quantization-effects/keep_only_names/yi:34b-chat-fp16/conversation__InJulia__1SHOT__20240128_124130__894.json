If it does, the word is added to the `names` array using `push!`. Finally, the `names` array is returned as the filtered list.\n\nTo use this function, simply call it with your list of words:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\nusing Test\n\noriginal_words = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"rat\", \"Dog\"] # Original list of words\nfiltered_names = keep_only_names(original_words) # Filter the names\n\n@test filtered_names == [\"Cat\", \"Dog\"] # Expected result\n```\n\nThis function is generic and should work for any list of strings, not just for `String`s representing names.","status":200,"tokens":[0,348],"elapsed":26.97754161,"_type":"aimessage"}]
