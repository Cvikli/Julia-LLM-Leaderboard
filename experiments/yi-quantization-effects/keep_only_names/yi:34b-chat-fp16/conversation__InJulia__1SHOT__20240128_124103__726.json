The following function will create a new list containing only those words from the original list that start with a capital letter:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Initialize an empty array to store the filtered words\n    new_words = Array{String, 1}()\n\n    # Iterate over each word in the original list\n    for w in words\n        # If the word is not all lowercase (i.e., it starts with a capital letter), add it to the new list\n        if !all(islower, w)\n            push!(new_words, w)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return new_words\nend\n```\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\noriginal_words = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"apple\", \"Zebra\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(original_words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Zebra\"]\n```\n\nThis function assumes that each word in the list is separated by whitespace. If the input contains multiple words per element (e.g., a list of strings like `[\"dog cat\", \"apple zebra\"]`), you would need to split them into individual words before applying this function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,328],"elapsed":25.415203416,"_type":"aimessage"}]
