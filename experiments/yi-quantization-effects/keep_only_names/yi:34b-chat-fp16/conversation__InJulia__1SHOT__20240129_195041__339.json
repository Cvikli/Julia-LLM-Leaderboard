Here's how you can define such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Predicate function to check if a word starts with an uppercase letter\n    is_name = uppercasefirst(word) == uppercase(word)\n    return filter(is_name, words)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nnames = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"apple\", \"Zebra\", \"pear\"]\ncleaned_names = keep_only_names(names)\nprintln(cleaned_names)  # Output will be something like: [\"Cat\", \"Zebra\"]\n```\n\nIn the `keep_only_names` function, we define a predicate function that uses `uppercasefirst` to convert the first character of each word to uppercase and then compares it with the result of `uppercase` which converts the entire string to uppercase. If both are equal, the word starts with an uppercase letter, and we keep it. We use `filter` to apply this predicate function to the list of words (`words`) and return only those that satisfy the condition.\n\nNote that the example above assumes you're working with a list of strings (which is not the case in Julia, but I'll adapt it for an Array). In Julia, arrays are the primary collection type, so you would typically define `names` as an array of strings:\n\n```julia\nusing Test\n\nfunction keep_only_names(words::AbstractVector{String})\n    # Predicate function to check if a word starts with an uppercase letter\n    is_name = uppercasefirst(word) == uppercase(word)\n    return filter(is_name, words)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nnames = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"apple\", \"Zebra\", \"pear\"]\ncleaned_names = keep_only_names(names)\n@test cleaned_names == [\"Cat\", \"Zebra\"]  # Use the Test package for asserting equality\n```\n\nIn this example, we use the `Test` package to assert that the returned array is equal to the expected result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,527],"elapsed":40.997878801,"_type":"aimessage"}]
