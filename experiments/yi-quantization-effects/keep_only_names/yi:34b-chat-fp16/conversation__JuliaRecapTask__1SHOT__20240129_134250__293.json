[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Initialize an empty vector to store the filtered words\n    names = Vector{String}()\n\n    # Iterate over each word in the list\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the first character of the word is uppercase\n        if isupper(word[1])\n            # If yes, add the word to the result vector\n            push!(names, word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return names\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of strings `words` and returns a new list containing only those words that start with an uppercase letter. It does this by iterating over each word in the list and checking if the first character is uppercase using the `isupper(char)` function, which returns `true` if the given character is uppercase. If the condition is met, the word is added to the result vector `names` using `push!(vector, element)`.\n\nAfter iterating over all words in the list, the `names` vector contains only those words that start with an uppercase letter. The function then returns this filtered list of strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,262],"elapsed":20.412611849,"_type":"aimessage"}]
