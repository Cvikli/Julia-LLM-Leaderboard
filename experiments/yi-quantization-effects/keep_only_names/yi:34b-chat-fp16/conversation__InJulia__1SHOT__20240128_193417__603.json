It uses the `startswith` function to check if the first character of each word is uppercase, and then pushes the word to the `capitalized_words` vector if it meets the criteria.\n\nYou can test the function as follows:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"apple\", \"PeAR\", \"zebra\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Cat\", \"PeAR\", \"zebra\"]\n```\n\nNote that the function is case-sensitive. If you want to be case-insensitive (e.g., consider \"dog\" and \"Dog\" as the same word), you can modify the check like this:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    # Initialize an empty vector to store the filtered words\n    capitalized_words = Vector{String}()\n    \n    for word in words\n        # Check if the first character of the word is uppercase, ignoring case\n        if startswith(word, uppercase(first(word)), true)  # Case-insensitive check\n            # If yes, push it to the new vector\n            push!(capitalized_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return capitalized_words\nend\n```\n\nThe `true` argument in the `startswith` function makes the comparison case-insensitive.","status":200,"tokens":[0,508],"elapsed":39.43977216,"_type":"aimessage"}]
