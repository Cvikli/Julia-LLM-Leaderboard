The `ismatch` function from the `Regex` module returns a boolean indicating whether there is a match for the regex in the string or not. If the regex matches, the word is added to the `names` array using `push!`.\n\nYou can call this function by passing a list of words:\n\n```julia\njulia> keep_only_names([\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"apple\", \"Zebra\"])\n4-element Vector{String}:\n \"Cat\"\n \"Zebra\"\n```\n\nNote that the `keep_only_names` function returns a vector of strings containing only the names (words starting with a capital letter) from the input list.","status":200,"tokens":[68,307],"elapsed":23.836930443,"_type":"aimessage"}]
