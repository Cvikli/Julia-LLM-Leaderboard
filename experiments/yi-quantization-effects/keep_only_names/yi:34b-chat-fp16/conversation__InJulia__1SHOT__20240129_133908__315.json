The `ismatch` function checks if the pattern matches the beginning of the string. If it does, the word is added to the `names` array using `push!`. Finally, the `return` statement returns the filtered list of names.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"dog\", \"cat\", \"Mouse\", \"apple\", \"Zebra\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names)  # Output: [\"Mouse\", \"Zebra\"]\n```\n\nThis will print out the list of names that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,320],"elapsed":24.791750641,"_type":"aimessage"}]
