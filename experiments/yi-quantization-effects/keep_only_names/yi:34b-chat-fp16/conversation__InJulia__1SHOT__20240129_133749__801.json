Here's how you can implement both approaches:\n\nUsing a for loop:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Initialize an empty array to store the filtered words\n    capitalized_words = Array{String,1}()\n\n    # Iterate over each word in the list\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the word starts with a capital letter\n        if startswith(word, uppercase(first(word)))\n            # Append the word to the new array if it passes the check\n            push!(capitalized_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return capitalized_words\nend\n```\n\nUsing a comprehension:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Filter the words using a comprehension\n    return [word for word in words if startswith(word, uppercase(first(word)))]\nend\n```\n\nBoth functions will return a new array containing only those words from `words` that start with a capital letter. The first function uses a loop to build the result incrementally, while the second function uses a comprehension, which is more concise and usually faster because it doesn't use a temporary array to store the results.\n\nYou can call these functions as follows:\n```julia\njulia> words = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"rat\", \"Duck\"]\n4-element Array{String,1}:\n \"dog\"\n \"Cat\"\n \"rat\"\n \"Duck\"\n\njulia> keep_only_names(words)\n3-element Array{String,1}:\n \"Cat\"\n \"Duck\"\n \"Dog\"\n```\n\nNote that the `keep_only_names` function assumes that each word is a lowercase version of the original and checks if it starts with an uppercase letter. If the input words are already in their proper case (e.g., \"Dog\"), there's no need to uppercase the first character for checking.","status":200,"tokens":[0,486],"elapsed":37.709237207,"_type":"aimessage"}]
