Here's how you can define such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Initialize an empty array to store the filtered words\n    capitalized_words = Vector{String}()\n\n    # Iterate over each word in the list\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the word starts with a capital letter\n        if startswith(word, uppercasefirst(word))\n            # Add the word to the output array if it does\n            push!(capitalized_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return capitalized_words\nend\n```\n\nThis function defines a `keep_only_names` function that takes in an array of words (`words`) and returns an array containing only the words that start with a capital letter. The `startswith` function is used to check if the word starts with its first character in uppercase, and `uppercasefirst` is used to convert the first character of each word to uppercase for comparison.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"apple\", \"Zebra\", \"banana\"]\ncapitalized_names = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(capitalized_names)  # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Zebra\"]\n```\n\nThis example shows how the `keep_only_names` function can be used to filter out words that do not start with a capital letter from a list of words.","status":200,"tokens":[0,387],"elapsed":30.003781105,"_type":"aimessage"}]
