It does this by iterating over each word in the list and checking if the first character is uppercase using `startswith` with the substring being the entire word converted to uppercase, and then appending it to the new vector if it passes the check.","status":200,"tokens":[0,213],"elapsed":16.506215823,"_type":"aimessage"}]
