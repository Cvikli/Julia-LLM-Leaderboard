If it is, the word is added to the result list. The `isascii` function is used to ensure that we're checking only printable ASCII characters, and the comparison against 'A' and 'Z' ensures that we're looking for true capital letters (not digits or other non-letter characters). Finally, the result list is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,234],"elapsed":18.127492413,"_type":"aimessage"}]
