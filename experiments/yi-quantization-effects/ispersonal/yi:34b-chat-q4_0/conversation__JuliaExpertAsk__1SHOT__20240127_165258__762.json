The `ispersonal` function checks if the provided vehicle is a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`, which are considered personal vehicles for everyday driving. If the vehicle is neither a `Car` nor a `Motorcycle`, the function returns `false` by default.","status":200,"tokens":[0,338],"elapsed":8.946448163,"_type":"aimessage"}]
