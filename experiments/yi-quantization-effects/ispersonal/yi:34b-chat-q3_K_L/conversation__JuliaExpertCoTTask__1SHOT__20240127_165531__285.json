All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Create a new trait called `PersonalVehicle` and make `Car` and `Motorcycle` subtypes of it.\n2. Define the `ispersonal` function to check if the vehicle type is `PersonalVehicle` or not.\n3. Override the default behavior for `Bus` and `Truck` by defining them as not personal vehicles.\n4. Test the function with examples of each vehicle type.\n5.
