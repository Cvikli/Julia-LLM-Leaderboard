The function `ispersonal` is defined based on the assumption that `Car` and `Motorcycle` are personal vehicles, while `Bus` and `Truck` are not. Any other type of vehicle that does not match these specific categories will throw an error.","status":200,"tokens":[134,254],"elapsed":6.90173282,"_type":"aimessage"}]
