The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Below is an implementation of the `ispersonal` function that uses this concept:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    if vehicle isa Car || vehicle isa Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif vehicle isa Bus || vehicle isa Truck\n        return false\n    end\n    # For all other types of vehicles, return false by default\n    false\nend\n\n# Example usage:\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n```\n\nIn the `ispersonal` function, we use pattern matching to check if the vehicle is of type `Car` or `Motorcycle` and return `true` for personal vehicles. For types `Bus` and `Truck`, we return `false`. For any other subtypes of `AbstractVehicle` that are not explicitly defined in the function, the default behavior of returning `false` is assumed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,297],"elapsed":7.884389171,"_type":"aimessage"}]
