The `ispersonal` function checks if the provided vehicle is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. It does this by using pattern matching with `isinstance` to check if the vehicle is a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`, which would be considered personal vehicles. If neither condition is met, it checks if the vehicle is a `Bus` or a `Truck` and returns false for these types. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, the function defaults to returning false.","status":200,"tokens":[134,299],"elapsed":13.597945138,"_type":"aimessage"}]
