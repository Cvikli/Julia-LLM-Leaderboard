All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The macro `@switch` is part of the Julia standard library and allows for a compact syntax to handle different cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,142],"elapsed":3.638972465,"_type":"aimessage"}]
