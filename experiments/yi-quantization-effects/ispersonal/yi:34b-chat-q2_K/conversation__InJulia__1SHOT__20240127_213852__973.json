All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, we can define a trait system using abstract base types and methods that are specialized based on the type hierarchy. Here's how you can implement the `ispersonal` function:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\n# Define personal vehicle types\nimmutable Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nimmutable Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\n\n# Define non-personal vehicle types\nimmutable Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nimmutable Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = true\nispersonal(_) = false\n\n# Example usage:\nprintln(\"Car is personal? \", ispersonal(Car))  # Should print true\nprintln(\"Motorcycle is personal? \", ispersonal(Motorcycle)) # Should print true\nprintln(\"Bus is personal? \", ispersonal(Bus))  # Should print false\nprintln(\"Truck is personal? \", ispersonal(Truck))  # Should print false\n```\n\nIn this example, we define `Car` and `Motorcycle` as subtypes of `AbstractVehicle` with the `ispersonal` function returning true for them by default. For `Bus` and `Truck`, since there are no explicit definitions for `ispersonal` regarding these types, the function defaults to false for them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,310],"elapsed":7.961268147,"_type":"aimessage"}]
