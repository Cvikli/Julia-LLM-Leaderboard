All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Define a trait `PersonalVehicle` and create corresponding types for each vehicle category that will inherit from `AbstractVehicle`.\n2. Implement the `ispersonal` function to check if the provided vehicle type is a personal vehicle or not.\n3. Ensure that `Car` and `Motorcycle` are considered personal vehicles, while `Bus` and `Truck` are not.\n4. Test the function with examples of each vehicle type.\n\n# Code\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nconst PersonalVehicle = Union{Car, Motorcycle}\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    return vehicle isa PersonalVehicle\nend\n\n# Example usage\nprintln(ispersonal(Car()))  # Output should be true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle())) # Output should be true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus()))   # Output should be false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck()))  # Output should be false\n```\n\n# Solution Checking\n\nTo check the solution, run the provided code in a Julia environment.
