We define four concrete types: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. The `ispersonal` function checks if a vehicle is of type `Car` or `Motorcycle`; if so, it returns `true`. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle` (like `Bus` or `Truck`), the function returns `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,259],"elapsed":7.475484449,"_type":"aimessage"}]
