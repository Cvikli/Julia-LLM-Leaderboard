The function `ispersonal` uses a pattern matching approach to determine if a vehicle type is for everyday driving. It returns `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle` because they are typically used for personal transportation, and `false` for `Bus` and `Truck` because they are generally used for public or commercial transportation. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle` that is not explicitly defined in the function, it returns `false` by default.","status":200,"tokens":[0,372],"elapsed":10.546108022,"_type":"aimessage"}]
