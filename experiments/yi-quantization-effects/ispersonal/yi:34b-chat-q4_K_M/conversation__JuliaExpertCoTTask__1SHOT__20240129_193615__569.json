All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The types `Car` and `Motorcycle` inherit from this abstract type, while `Bus` and `Truck` do not. The function correctly returns true for personal vehicles and false for non-personal ones. No other subtypes of `AbstractVehicle` are defined, so the default behavior is to return false for them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,345],"elapsed":10.050002449,"_type":"aimessage"}]
