It does so by checking if the vehicle is either a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`, as these are considered personal vehicles for everyday driving. The other types (`Bus` and `Truck`) are classified as non-personal vehicles, and thus the function returns `false` for them. For any other type of `AbstractVehicle` that is not explicitly mentioned, the function also returns `false` by default.","status":200,"tokens":[134,321],"elapsed":9.263315559,"_type":"aimessage"}]
