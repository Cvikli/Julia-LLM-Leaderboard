[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

It returns `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle`, as they are typically used for everyday driving by individuals, and `false` for `Bus` and `Truck`, as these are generally not considered personal vehicles. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, it defaults to `false`.\n\nTo test the function:\n\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n\n# For any other type not defined above, it will return false by default\njulia> ispersonal(StructThatIsNotAVehicle())\nfalse\n```\n\nThis function adheres to the provided instructions and uses the `AbstractVehicle` type as a base class for vehicles.","status":200,"tokens":[0,353],"elapsed":27.620576326,"_type":"aimessage"}]
