It uses the `Dates` package to parse the dates, and then checks for conflicts by comparing the finish times of events that share the same start time. If there are no conflicts, it returns \"No conflicts\"; otherwise, it returns \"Conflict\". If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,423],"elapsed":32.874822312,"_type":"aimessage"}]
