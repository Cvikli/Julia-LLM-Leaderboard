It uses the `Dates` package to parse these strings into dates. The function then checks for conflicts by comparing the start and finish times of all pairs of events. If there is any overlap, the function returns \"Conflict\"; otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\". If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,294],"elapsed":22.804372041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
