[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

The function checks for scheduling conflicts by comparing the start and end times of each event with those of the following events. If there is any overlap between the time ranges of two consecutive events, it returns \"Conflict\".\n\nThe `is_conflict` function is a helper function that checks if two events conflict based on their start and finish times. It accounts for the case where an event's start time is at or after another event's finish time, which would indicate an overlap.\n\nThe main loop of the `event_scheduler` function iterates over all events except the last one (since there is no following event to check against) and calls `is_conflict` for each pair of consecutive events. If a conflict is found, it returns \"Conflict\"; otherwise, it continues until all events have been checked.\n\nFinally, if no conflicts are found, the function returns \"No conflicts\". The example usage demonstrates how to call the `event_scheduler` function with a list of events and prints the result.","status":200,"tokens":[431,626],"elapsed":49.056543668,"_type":"aimessage"}]
