Here's how you can implement the `event_scheduler` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    # Initialize a dictionary to store the start and finish times of each event\n    event_times = Dict()\n    for (start, finish) in events\n        start_time = DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n        finish_time = DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n        start_date = DateTime(start, start_time)\n        finish_date = DateTime(finish, finish_time)\n        \n        # Add the event times to the dictionary\n        for time in [start_date, finish_date]\n            if !haskey(event_times, string(time.year))\n                event_times[string(time.year)] = Dict()\n            end\n            event_times[string(time.year)][string(time.month)] = Dict()\n            event_times[string(time.year)][string(time.month)][string(time.day)] = time\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Check for conflicts within the same year\n    for (year, months) in event_times\n        for (month, days) in months\n            for day1 in keys(days)\n                for day2 in keys(days)\n                    if day1 != day2 && days[day1] <= days[day2]\n                        return \"Conflict\"\n                    end\n                end\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # No conflicts found\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nevents = [(\"2023-01-01 09:00\", \"2023-01-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-01-02 14:00\", \"2023-01-02 16:00\")]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events))\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of tuples where each tuple contains the start and finish times of an event in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'. It then parses these dates using `Dates`, storing the start and finish times for each event in a dictionary keyed by year, month, and day. Finally, it checks for conflicts within the same year by comparing the start and finish times of events on different days.\n\nIf there are no conflicts, the function returns \"No conflicts\". If any events overlap in time, it returns \"Conflict\". If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,691],"elapsed":53.852436678,"_type":"aimessage"}]
