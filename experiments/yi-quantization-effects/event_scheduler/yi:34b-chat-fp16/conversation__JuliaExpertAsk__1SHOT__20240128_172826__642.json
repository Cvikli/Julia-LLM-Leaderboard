It then checks for any scheduling conflicts by iterating through all pairs of events, ensuring that there is no overlap between the start and end times of one event with the end and start times of another event, respectively. If no conflict is found, it returns \"No conflicts\"; otherwise, it returns \"Conflict\". If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\". The `Date` constructor from the `Dates` package is used to parse the strings into actual dates for comparison.","status":200,"tokens":[0,423],"elapsed":32.859670481,"_type":"aimessage"}]
