[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

It then checks for overlaps between each pair of events by comparing their start and finish times. If there's no overlap, it continues to the next event pair; otherwise, it returns \"Conflict\" immediately.\n\nTo use this function, simply call it with a list of event tuples:\n\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2023-01-01 10:00\", \"2023-01-01 12:00\"), (\"2023-01-01 13:00\", \"2023-01-01 15:00\")]\nprint(event_scheduler(events))  # Output will be \"No conflicts\" since there are no overlapping events in this example.\n```\n\nIf you have any events that do overlap, the function will return \"Conflict\" accordingly. If the list is empty, it will return \"No events\" as instructed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,441],"elapsed":34.511057272,"_type":"aimessage"}]
