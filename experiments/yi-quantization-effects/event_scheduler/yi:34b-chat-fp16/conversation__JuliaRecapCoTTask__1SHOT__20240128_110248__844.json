[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

If any overlap is detected, it returns \"Conflict\". If there are no events or no conflicts, it returns \"No events\" or \"No conflicts\", respectively. The function uses `parse_date` and `parse_time` to parse the date and time strings provided in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM' and then calculates the duration of each event in minutes for easier comparison.\n\nThe comparison of durations is done by taking the difference between the maximum and minimum dates within an event, which represents the length of the event in days, and then multiplying by 24 hours per day and 60 minutes per hour to convert the duration to minutes. This approach ensures that events that span multiple days are also considered correctly.\n\nThe nested `for` loop iterates through all pairs of events (excluding itself) to check for conflicts. If a conflict is found, the function returns immediately with \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all event pairs, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,522],"elapsed":40.796105357,"_type":"aimessage"}]
