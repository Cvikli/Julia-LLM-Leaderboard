It uses the `Dates` package to parse the dates and times. The `event_scheduler` function checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events by comparing the start time of each event with the end time of all other events, and vice versa. If there is an overlap, it returns \"Conflict\"; otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\". If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,425],"elapsed":33.018259806,"_type":"aimessage"}]
