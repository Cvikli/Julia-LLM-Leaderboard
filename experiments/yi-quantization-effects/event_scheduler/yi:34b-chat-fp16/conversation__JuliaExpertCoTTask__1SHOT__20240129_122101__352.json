It uses the `Dates` package to parse the date strings into dates and then compares the start and finish times of each event with those of all subsequent events. If there is an overlap, it returns \"Conflict\"; otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\". If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,435],"elapsed":33.913399142,"_type":"aimessage"}]
