It uses the `Dates` package to parse the dates from strings into `Date` objects for comparison.\n\nThe function iterates over all pairs of events (i.e., all possible combinations of two events) and checks if there is any overlap between their start and finish times. If there is no overlap, the function continues to check the next pair of events. If a conflict is found, the function returns \"Conflict\"; otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nIf the list of events is empty, the function returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,359],"elapsed":27.870231244,"_type":"aimessage"}]
