Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

Each event is a tuple with two elements: the start time and the finish time. We will use the `Dates` package for parsing the date strings into DateTime objects. Then, we'll iterate through the list of events and check for any overlaps between the start and end times of each event.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    # Convert strings to DateTime objects\n    event_times = map(event -> (DateTime(event[1]), DateTime(event[2])), events)\n\n    # Check for conflicts in the event times\n    for i in 1:length(events)-1\n        for j in i+1:length(events)\n            if isoverlapping(event_times[i]..., event_times[j]...)\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\n# Example usage with provided data\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\n\nThe `isoverlapping` function checks if two ranges of DateTime objects overlap. If there is no conflict found after checking all pairs of events, the function returns \"No conflicts\". If a conflict is detected, it returns \"Conflict\".\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that each event has a unique start time, and it does not account for events with the same end time but different start times (which might require more sophisticated logic).","status":200,"tokens":[0,443],"elapsed":34.536726301,"_type":"aimessage"}]
