It uses the `Dates` package to parse these strings into date objects. Then it checks for any overlap between each pair of events by comparing their start and finish times. If there is no conflict, the function returns \"No conflicts\"; otherwise, it returns \"Conflict\". If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[150,310],"elapsed":24.1112177,"_type":"aimessage"}]
