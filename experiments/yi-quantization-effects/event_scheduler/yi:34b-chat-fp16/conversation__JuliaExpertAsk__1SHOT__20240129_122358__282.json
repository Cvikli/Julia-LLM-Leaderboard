It then iterates through each event, marking the corresponding time slots as occupied. Finally, it checks for conflicts by finding all non-zero elements in the boolean array. If there are more than one such element (indicating multiple events overlapping at the same time), it returns \"Conflict\"; otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,421],"elapsed":32.713354625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
