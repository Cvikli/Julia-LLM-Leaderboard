Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

Each event is a tuple with a start and finish time in the specified format. We use the `Dates` package for parsing the dates. The function checks if there are any scheduling conflicts among the events and returns \"No conflicts\" if none are found, \"Conflict\" if there's at least one overlap, and \"No events\" if the list is empty.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    # Initialize a dictionary to store active events\n    active_events = Dict()\n\n    for (start_time, finish_time) in events\n        # Check if the event starts within an ongoing event\n        if start_time <= maximum(collect(values(active_events)))\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n\n        # Mark the event as active\n        active_events[finish_time] = true\n    end\n\n    # If we reach this point, there are no conflicts\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThe function works by initializing an `active_events` dictionary where the keys are finish times of the events. It then iterates through each event and checks if its start time is before any of the existing active events' finish times. If so, there's a conflict, and the function returns \"Conflict\" immediately. Otherwise, it adds the new event to the `active_events` dictionary without removing any previous entries, ensuring that we only keep track of the most recent events in case an overlap is found later on.\n\n# Example\n\nGiven the list of events provided:\n\n```julia\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\n\nThe function would return \"Conflict\" because the second event starts at 11:30, which is within the duration of the first event that finishes at 11:00.","status":200,"tokens":[0,535],"elapsed":24.277530517,"_type":"aimessage"}]
