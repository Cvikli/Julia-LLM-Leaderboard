It then checks for conflicts among all pairs of events by comparing their start and finish times using the `Date` type from the `Dates` package for parsing. If there are no conflicts, it returns \"No conflicts\"; if there is at least one conflict, it returns \"Conflict\"; and if the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,330],"elapsed":14.85175697,"_type":"aimessage"}]
