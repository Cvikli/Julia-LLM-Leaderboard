It sorts the events by their start times in descending order to ensure that we only need to check each event against those with earlier start times. Then, it iterates through the list and checks if any event overlaps with a previous one. If no conflicts are found, it returns \"No conflicts\". Otherwise, it returns \"Conflict\".","status":200,"tokens":[150,336],"elapsed":9.079371496,"_type":"aimessage"}]
