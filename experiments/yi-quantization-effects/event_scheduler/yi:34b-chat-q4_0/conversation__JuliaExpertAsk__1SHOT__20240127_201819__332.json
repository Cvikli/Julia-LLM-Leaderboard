It then checks for any scheduling conflicts by iterating over all pairs of events (i.e., checking every event against all following events) to ensure there are no overlapping time ranges. If no conflicts are found, the function returns \"No conflicts\". If a conflict is detected, it returns \"Conflict\". If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,243],"elapsed":6.446311211,"_type":"aimessage"}]
