Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

It then stores the end times of all events in a separate array to improve performance when checking for overlaps. Finally, it iteratively checks if the end time of each event is before the start time of the next event. If an overlap is detected, \"Conflict\" is returned; otherwise, \"No conflicts\" is returned.\n\nIf there are no events, the function returns a clear message indicating so.","status":200,"tokens":[0,421],"elapsed":11.288708819,"_type":"aimessage"}]
