The events are represented as tuples with start and finish times in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'. We use the `Dates` package for parsing dates and times correctly.\n\nThe function works by iterating over each event pair and checking if the start time of one event is before or equal to the start time of another event, and its finish time is after or equal to its start time. Similarly, it checks if the finish time of an event overlaps with the start time of another event. If any such overlap is found, a conflict is declared, and the function returns \"Conflict\".\n\nIn the absence of conflicts, the function returns \"No conflicts\". If the input list of events is empty, the function returns \"No events\" to indicate that there are no events to schedule.","status":200,"tokens":[0,459],"elapsed":12.375771435,"_type":"aimessage"}]
