If so, there's a conflict. It does this by iterating through all possible combinations of events, comparing their start and finish times.\n\nPlease note that the `DateTime` type in Julia is used for exact time representations, which means it can handle both local and UTC times. For parsing dates with different formats, you would need to convert them to `DateTime` using the appropriate functions from the `Dates` package.","status":200,"tokens":[120,456],"elapsed":12.303297955,"_type":"aimessage"}]
