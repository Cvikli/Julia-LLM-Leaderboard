We'll use the `Dates` package for parsing the dates and calculating time differences.\n\nHere's how the function could be implemented:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    for i in 1:(length(events) - 1)\n        start_i = Date(events[i][1])\n        finish_i = Date(events[i][2])\n        conflict = false\n\n        # Check if the event starts after another one has finished or if it finishes before another one starts\n        for j in (i + 1):length(events)\n            start_j = Date(events[j][1])\n            finish_j = Date(events[j][2])\n\n            if start_i <= finish_j && start_j <= finish_i\n                conflict = true\n                break\n            end\n        end\n\n        # No conflict found for this event, continue to the next one\n        if !conflict\n            continue\n        end\n\n        # Output the conflict details\n        print(\"Event $(i) overlaps with Event $(j)\")\n    end\n\n    if !conflict\n        return \"No conflicts\"\n    else\n        return \"Conflicts found\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThe function works as follows:\n1. If the list of events is empty, return \"No events\" immediately.\n2. Loop through each event in the list.\n3. For each event, check if its start time is before another event's finish time and if its finish time is after another event's start time. If so, a conflict is found and it is reported.\n4. If no conflict is found for an event, continue to the next event.\n5. If any conflict is found, return \"Conflicts found\".\n6. If no conflict is found for all events, return \"No conflicts\".\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that each event is given as a tuple with two strings in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM' and that the list of events is not empty. It also assumes that if an event starts at 12:00 PM, it would conflict with another event finishing at 12:05 PM, for example. If you need to consider only exact time overlaps (e.g., two events starting and ending at the same time) as a conflict, please modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,617],"elapsed":16.495710599,"_type":"aimessage"}]
