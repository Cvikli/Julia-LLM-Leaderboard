It uses the `DateFormat` constructor from the `Dates` package to parse the dates correctly. The function then checks for conflicts by iterating through all pairs of events, ensuring that if any event starts before or ends after another event, it is considered a conflict. If no conflict is found, the function returns \"No conflicts\". If there are no events provided, the function returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,395],"elapsed":10.533681191,"_type":"aimessage"}]
