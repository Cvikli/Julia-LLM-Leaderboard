[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

It uses the `DateTime` constructor from the `Dates` package to parse these strings into actual dates and times. The `lt=true` argument for the sort function tells Julia to sort the events by start time in ascending order (earliest first).\n\nThe algorithm works as follows:\n\n1. Sort the events by their start time.\n2. Iterate through each event, checking if its start time is less than or equal to the current interval's end time and its finish time is greater than the current interval's start time. If so, there's a conflict with the current interval.\n3. Update the current interval to include the duration of the event by adding the difference between the event's start and finish times to the current interval.\n\nIf no conflicts are found, the function returns \"No conflicts\". If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[431,510],"elapsed":14.058647103,"_type":"aimessage"}]
