Here's how you might implement an `event_scheduler` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    # Sort the events by start time to make comparisons easier\n    sorted_events = sort(events, by=e -> DateTime(e[1], \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM\"))\n\n    # Initialize a set of ongoing events (to avoid edge cases with start and end times)\n    ongoing_events = Set()\n\n    for event in sorted_events\n        start_time = DateTime(event[1], \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM\")\n        finish_time = DateTime(event[2], \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM\")\n\n        # Check if the event starts within an ongoing event's duration\n        if start_time in ongoing_events\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n\n        # Add the finish time to the set so we can check for events that end during this one\n        push!(ongoing_events, finish_time)\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nevents = [(\"2023-01-01 09:00\", \"2023-01-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-01-01 10:00\", \"2023-01-01 12:00\")]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events))\n```\n\nThis function sorts the events by start time and then iterates over them. For each event, it checks if its start time is within an ongoing event (which is a set of finish times). If so, there's a conflict. The `ongoing_events` set is used to track when an event ends without causing a conflict with the next event.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that all events have unique start times and that the end time of one event does not coincide with the start time of another (edge cases that would require more sophisticated logic).","status":200,"tokens":[120,524],"elapsed":17.32623645,"_type":"aimessage"}]
