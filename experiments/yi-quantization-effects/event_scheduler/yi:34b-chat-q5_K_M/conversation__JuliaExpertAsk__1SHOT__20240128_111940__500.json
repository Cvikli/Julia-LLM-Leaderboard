It uses the `split` function to separate the date from the time in each string, then converts them into `Date` and `Time` objects for comparison using the `Dates` package.\n\nThe events are sorted by their start times to make the conflict checking more efficient. The logic checks if a new event starts before or at the end of the previous event, and if it ends after or at the start of the next event. If both conditions are met, it indicates a scheduling conflict between the current event and the one before it, as well as with the one after it.\n\nIf no conflicts are found, the function returns \"No conflicts\". If there is at least one conflict, it returns \"Conflict\". If the list of events is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,489],"elapsed":16.021911064,"_type":"aimessage"}]
