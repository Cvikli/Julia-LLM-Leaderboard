[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

First, we import the `Dates` package for parsing date and time strings into Julia's `Date` and `Time` types.\n\n2. We define a function `parse_event` to parse each event string into a tuple of start and finish times in `Date` and `DateTime` format. The function uses `split` to separate the year, month, day, hour, and minute from the event string, then converts these into a `Date` using `Date(year=..., month=..., day=...)` and a `Time` using `Time(hour=..., minute=...)`. It returns a tuple of these two values.\n\n3. The `event_scheduler` function takes a vector of event strings as input. If the list is empty, it simply returns \"No events\".\n\n4. We convert the event strings into parsed tuples using `parse_event` and store them in a new vector.\n\n5. To check for conflicts, we iterate through each event tuple and compare its finish time with the start times of all subsequent events. If there is an overlap, we return \"Conflict\". We use `isempty(overlap(start1, end2))` to check if there's any overlap between two events where `start1` is the start time of the current event and `end2` is the finish time of the next event.\n\n6. If no conflicts are found, we return \"No conflicts\".\n\n7. Finally, we provide an example usage that demonstrates how to call the `event_scheduler` function with a list of events.","status":200,"tokens":[0,783],"elapsed":26.01127152,"_type":"aimessage"}]
