Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

The `event_scheduler` function is defined to take a vector of tuples as input, where each tuple represents an event with its start and finish times in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'.\n\n2. If the list of events is empty, the function returns \"No events\".\n\n3. The events are sorted by their start time using the `sort` function with a custom sorting criterion specified by the `by` keyword argument. This ensures that we can efficiently check for conflicts by iterating over the events in ascending order of their start times.\n\n4. A loop is used to iterate through each event starting from the second one, as the first event cannot conflict with any previous event (since it's the earliest). For each event, its start time is compared to the finish time of the previous event. If the current event does not overlap with the previous one, we continue to the next event.\n\n5. If an overlap is detected between a current event and a previous event, the function immediately returns \"Conflict\".\n\n6. If the loop finishes without returning \"Conflict\", it means that there are no conflicts among the events, and the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,587],"elapsed":19.278111681,"_type":"aimessage"}]
