Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

We'll use `Dates` to parse the strings into date-time values. Then, we'll iterate over each pair of events and check if their start and finish times overlap. If there is any conflict, we return \"Conflict\"; otherwise, we return \"No conflicts\".\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    # Parse the start and finish times of each event into DateTimes\n    event_times = [(DateTime(s), DateTime(f)) for (s, f) in events]\n\n    # Check for conflicts between all pairs of events\n    for (i, e1) in enumerate(event_times)\n        for (j, e2) in enumerate(event_times)\n            if i != j && hasconflict(e1, e2)\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    # If no conflicts were found, return \"No conflicts\"\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\nfunction hasconflict(e1, e2)\n    # Check if the start time of e2 is between the start and finish times of e1\n    return (e2[1] > e1[1] && e2[1] < e1[2]) ||\n           # Or if the end time of e2 is between the start and finish times of e1\n           (e2[2] > e1[1] && e2[2] < e1[2]) ||\n           # Or if e2 entirely contains e1 (start of e2 <= start of e1 <= finish of e2)\n           (e2[1] <= e1[1] && e1[2] <= e2[2])\nend\n\n# Example usage with provided data\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\n\nThis code defines two functions: `event_scheduler` which is the main function that checks for conflicts among all events, and `hasconflict` which checks if there's a conflict between two specific events. The `event_scheduler` function uses `enumerate` to iterate over each event and check for conflicts with all other events.\n\nThe output of calling `event_scheduler` with the provided data should be:\n\n```plaintext\n\"Conflict\"","status":200,"tokens":[0,634],"elapsed":20.444048249,"_type":"aimessage"}]
