It then checks each pair of events for an intersection by finding the difference between the finish time of the first event and the start time of the second event. If there is any overlap, it returns \"Conflict\"; otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\". If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,387],"elapsed":12.422718333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
