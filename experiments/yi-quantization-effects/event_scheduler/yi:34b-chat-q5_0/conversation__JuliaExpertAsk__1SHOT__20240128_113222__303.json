It uses the `Dates` package for parsing the dates and durations from strings to `Date` and `Duration` objects. The function then checks for conflicts by comparing the start and end times of each pair of events, ensuring there is no overlap between them. If no conflicts are found, the message \"No conflicts\" is returned; otherwise, \"Conflict\" is returned. If the list is empty, \"No events\" is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[150,401],"elapsed":12.956112029,"_type":"aimessage"}]
