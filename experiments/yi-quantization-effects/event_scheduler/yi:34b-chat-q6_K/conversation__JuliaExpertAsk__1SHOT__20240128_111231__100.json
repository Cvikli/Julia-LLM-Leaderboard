It uses the `DateTime` constructor from the `Dates` package to parse the strings into actual date-time values.\n\nThe function checks for conflicts between all pairs of events by comparing their start and finish times. If there is any overlap, the function returns \"Conflict\". If there are no overlapping events, it returns \"No conflicts\". If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[150,359],"elapsed":13.528359213,"_type":"aimessage"}]
