It uses the `Dates` package to parse these strings into `DateTime` objects for comparison. The function then checks each event against all subsequent events to ensure there are no overlapping time ranges. If there are no conflicts, it returns \"No conflicts\"; if there is at least one conflict, it returns \"Conflict\". If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,332],"elapsed":12.347777593,"_type":"aimessage"}]
