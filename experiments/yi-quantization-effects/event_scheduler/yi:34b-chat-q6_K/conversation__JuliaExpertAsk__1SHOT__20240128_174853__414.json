Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})::String\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    for (i, e1) in enumerate(events)\n        start1, finish1 = DateTime.(e1)\n        for e2 in events[i+1:end]\n            start2, finish2 = DateTime.(e2)\n            if start1 <= finish2 && start2 <= finish1\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of events, each event being a tuple of two strings representing the start and finish times in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM format. It then converts these strings into `DateTime` objects using the `Dates` package for comparison. The function iterates over all pairs of events, checking if there is any overlap between their time ranges. If no conflicts are found, it returns \"No conflicts\"; otherwise, it returns \"Conflict\". If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[150,260],"elapsed":9.832666526,"_type":"aimessage"}]
