It uses the `Dates` package to parse the strings into `DateTime` objects for comparison. The list of events is sorted by start time to simplify the conflict checking process. Then, it iterates over each event, comparing its finish time with the start time of the next event in the list. If any overlap is detected, the function returns \"Conflict\"; otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\". If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,367],"elapsed":13.651764052,"_type":"aimessage"}]
