It then converts these strings into `DateTime` objects using the `Dates` package for comparison. The function iterates over all pairs of events, checking if there is any overlap between their start and finish times. If no conflicts are found, it returns \"No conflicts\". Otherwise, it returns \"Conflict\". If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,272],"elapsed":10.11380609,"_type":"aimessage"}]
