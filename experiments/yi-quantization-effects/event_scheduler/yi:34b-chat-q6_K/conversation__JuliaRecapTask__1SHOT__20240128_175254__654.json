[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

If not, it returns \"No events\".\n- If there are events, it sorts them by start time using `sort` and a custom comparison function that compares the tuples by their start times using `DateTime`.\n- Then, it iterates over the sorted list of events. For each event, it checks if its start time is within 1 minute of the finish time of the previous event (if there is one). If so, we have a conflict.\n- If no conflicts are found, the function returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the events are distinct and do not share the same start or finish times. If this assumption does not hold, additional logic would be needed to handle such cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,449],"elapsed":16.931365074,"_type":"aimessage"}]
