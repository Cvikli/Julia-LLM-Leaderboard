It creates a dictionary where each key is a time (converted to an `Instant`), and the value indicates whether the time is part of any event's schedule. Then it checks for conflicts by looking at the intersection of any two times stored in the dictionary. If there is no intersection between any pair of times, there are no conflicts.","status":200,"tokens":[0,435],"elapsed":16.236301363,"_type":"aimessage"}]
