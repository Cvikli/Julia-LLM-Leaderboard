It checks for scheduling conflicts among the events using the `Dates.overlaps` function, which returns true if two dates or date-time intervals overlap. If there are no overlapping events, the function returns \"No conflicts\". If any events overlap, it returns \"Conflict\". If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,321],"elapsed":11.929489265,"_type":"aimessage"}]
