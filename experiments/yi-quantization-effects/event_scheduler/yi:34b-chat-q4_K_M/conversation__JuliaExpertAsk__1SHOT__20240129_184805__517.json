It then checks for conflicts by comparing the start time of each event with the finish times of all subsequent events, and vice versa. If there is an overlap, the function returns \"Conflict\". If no such overlap exists, it returns \"No conflicts\". If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,521],"elapsed":15.1780299,"_type":"aimessage"}]
