[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

It first converts these strings to `Date` objects using the `Dates` package for accurate time parsing. Then, it checks for scheduling conflicts by comparing the start and end times of each event with the start and end times of all other events. If any overlap is found, the function returns \"Conflict\". If there are no overlaps, it returns \"No conflicts\". If the list of events is empty, it returns \"No events\".\n\nPlease note that this example assumes the input events do not have any timezone information specified and uses UTC as the default timezone for consistency. If the input events have timezone information, you should parse them accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,549],"elapsed":15.851394718,"_type":"aimessage"}]
