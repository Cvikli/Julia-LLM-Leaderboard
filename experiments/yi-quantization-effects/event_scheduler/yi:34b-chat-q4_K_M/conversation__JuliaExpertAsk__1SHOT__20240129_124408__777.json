It uses the `Dates` package to parse the dates and times. The events are sorted by their start time, and then for each event, it checks if there is a conflict with any subsequent event in the list. If a conflict is found, the function returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found, it returns \"No conflicts\". If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,358],"elapsed":10.376767195,"_type":"aimessage"}]
