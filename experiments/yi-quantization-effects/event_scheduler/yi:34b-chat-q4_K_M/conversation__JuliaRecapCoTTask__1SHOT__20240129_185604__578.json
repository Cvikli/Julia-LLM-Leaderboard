X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

If not, it returns \"No events\".\n- For each event, it parses the start and finish times from strings to `TimeZones.LocalDateTime` objects using `Dates.datetime`.\n- It then iterates over all pairs of consecutive events (from 1st to last minus 1) and checks if there is an overlap between their time ranges. If there is, it returns \"Conflict\".\n- If no conflicts are found, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nPlease note that this function assumes the list of events is ordered by start times (which may not be the case in all scenarios) and that the finish time of each event is after its start time. If these assumptions do not hold, additional logic would be required to handle such cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,631],"elapsed":18.671886995,"_type":"aimessage"}]
