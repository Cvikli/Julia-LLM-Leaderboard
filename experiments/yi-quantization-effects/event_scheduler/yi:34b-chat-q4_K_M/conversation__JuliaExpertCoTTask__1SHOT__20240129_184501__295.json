It then checks for conflicts by ensuring that no event starts during another event and that no event finishes before another event's scheduled time. If there are no conflicts, the function returns \"No conflicts\". If a conflict is detected, it returns \"Conflict\". If the list of events is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[313,529],"elapsed":21.433352264,"_type":"aimessage"}]
