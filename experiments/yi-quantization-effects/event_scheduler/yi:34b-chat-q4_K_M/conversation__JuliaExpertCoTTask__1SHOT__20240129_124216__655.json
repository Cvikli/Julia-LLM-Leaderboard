It also does not account for events that start or end at midnight, as the `Date` constructor used here interprets the date string as a whole without considering the time component for dates before 1970-01-01. If such cases need to be handled, additional logic would be required.","status":200,"tokens":[0,399],"elapsed":11.681475311,"_type":"aimessage"}]
