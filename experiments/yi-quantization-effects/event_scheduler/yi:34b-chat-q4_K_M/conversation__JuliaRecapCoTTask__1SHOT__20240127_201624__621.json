[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

The events are sorted by start time, and a set of active event ranges is maintained to check for overlaps with new events as they are added. The `conflict_check` function is used to determine if there is an overlap between the new event's range and any existing active ranges.\n\nThe output will be \"No conflicts\" if there are no scheduling conflicts, \"Conflict\" if there is at least one conflict, and \"No events\" if the list of events is empty.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that all dates and times are provided in a consistent format. If the input data needs to be parsed from strings, you will need to include code to handle that conversion as well.","status":200,"tokens":[0,653],"elapsed":18.884719456,"_type":"aimessage"}]
