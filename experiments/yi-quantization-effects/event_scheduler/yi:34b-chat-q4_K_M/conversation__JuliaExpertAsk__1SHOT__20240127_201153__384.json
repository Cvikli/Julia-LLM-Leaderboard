Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

If the list is empty, it will return `\"No events\"`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,560],"elapsed":15.990905176,"_type":"aimessage"}]
