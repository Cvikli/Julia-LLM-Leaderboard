It sorts the events by their start time to ensure that we check for conflicts in the correct order. Then, it iterates over the sorted list and compares the start and end times of each event with the next event's corresponding times. If there is an overlap, the function returns \"Conflict\"; otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\". If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\". The `startswith` check is used to ensure that we are comparing dates from the same century (20th or 21st).","status":200,"tokens":[0,584],"elapsed":16.671589802,"_type":"aimessage"}]
