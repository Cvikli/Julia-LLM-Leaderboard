It does this by iterating over each event and checking if it overlaps with any other event in the list using `check_overlap` function. If there is an overlap, `event_scheduler` returns \"Conflict\", otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\". If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".\n\nThe `check_overlap` function compares the start and finish times of two events to determine if they overlap. It converts the dates from strings to `DateTime` objects with the `Dates` package for accurate comparison.\n\nTo test the function, an example list of events is provided and printed to the console.","status":200,"tokens":[313,516],"elapsed":33.284139126,"_type":"aimessage"}]
