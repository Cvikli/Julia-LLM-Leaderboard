Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    for i in 1:length(events)-1\n        for j in (i+1):length(events)\n            start1, finish1 = events[i]\n            start2, finish2 = events[j]\n\n            if Date(finish1) <= Date(start2) || Date(start1) >= Date(finish2)\n                # No conflict between these two events\n                continue\n            end\n\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\n# Example usage with provided data\nevents_data = [(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]\nevent_scheduler(events_data)\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating through all pairs of events and checking if the start time of one event is before the finish time of another event.

If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,349],"elapsed":9.984550067,"_type":"aimessage"}]
