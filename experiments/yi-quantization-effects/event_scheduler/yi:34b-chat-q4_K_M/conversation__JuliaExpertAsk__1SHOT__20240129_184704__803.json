It uses the `Dates` package to parse these strings into `DateTime` objects. A dictionary is used to store each event as a key with its corresponding start time as the value. The function then checks for conflicts by iterating over each event and checking if any other event's start or finish time overlaps with it using the `has_overlap` function, which returns true if there is an overlap between two times. If no conflict is found, the function returns \"No conflicts\". If a conflict is detected, the function returns \"Conflict\". If the list of events is empty, the function returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[150,616],"elapsed":18.184075155,"_type":"aimessage"}]
