It uses the `Dates` package for parsing the dates and creating time intervals. If there are no conflicts, it returns \"No conflicts\"; if a conflict is found, it returns the list of conflicting finish times as a string; and if the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,375],"elapsed":10.656362576,"_type":"aimessage"}]
