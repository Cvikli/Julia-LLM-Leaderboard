Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If this assumption does not hold, you would need to parse the date and time strings more accurately and adjust the logic accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,426],"elapsed":12.480601914,"_type":"aimessage"}]
