[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

For each event, it checks if there are any other ongoing events that overlap with the current event's start and finish times. If no conflicts are found, the function returns `\"No conflicts\"`. If a conflict is detected, it returns `\"Conflict\"`. If the list of events is empty, it returns `\"No events\"`.\n\nTo use this function, you would call it with your list of event tuples:\n\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2023-01-01 09:00\", \"2023-01-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-01-01 10:00\", \"2023-01-01 12:00\")]\nevent_scheduler(events)\n```\n\nIf you want to test the function with an empty list or a list that contains no conflicting events, you can modify the `events` vector accordingly and see the different outputs.","status":200,"tokens":[0,639],"elapsed":18.880068975,"_type":"aimessage"}]
