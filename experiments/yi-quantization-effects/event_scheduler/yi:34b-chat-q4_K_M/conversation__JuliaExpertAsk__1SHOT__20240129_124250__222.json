Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

It uses a boolean array to track which times are occupied, ensuring linear time complexity regardless of the number of events. If no conflicts are found, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[150,540],"elapsed":15.916614529,"_type":"aimessage"}]
