[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

Each event is represented as a tuple with start and finish times, both in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'.\n- We use the `Dates` package to parse the dates from strings into actual Date objects for comparison.\n- The function iteratively checks each pair of events to see if there is an overlap in time between their start and finish times.\n- If no conflicts are found, the message \"No conflicts\" is returned. If at least one conflict is detected, the message \"Conflict\" is returned.\n- If the list of events is empty, a special message \"No events\" is returned.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that all dates and times are provided in the same format and that there are no duplicate or invalid event entries. The `Dates` package provides additional functionality for more robust date parsing if needed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,512],"elapsed":14.798599288,"_type":"aimessage"}]
