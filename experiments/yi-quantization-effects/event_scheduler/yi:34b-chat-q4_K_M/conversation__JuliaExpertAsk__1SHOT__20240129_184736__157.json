It uses the `Dates` package to parse these strings into `DateTime` objects for comparison. The `event_dates` array is created by converting each event's start time to a DateTime object, then creating an interval from the start to finish time of that event.\n\nThe function then checks for conflicts between all pairs of events by finding the intersection of their corresponding intervals. If any intersection is found, it means there is a scheduling conflict, and the function returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found, the function returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nIf the list of events is empty, the function returns \"No events\" to indicate that there are no events to schedule.","status":200,"tokens":[0,342],"elapsed":9.911242077,"_type":"aimessage"}]
