[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

For each event, it checks if there are any ongoing events that conflict with it (i.e., their finish times overlap with the current event's start time). If a conflict is detected, it prints \"Conflict: Event N\" where N is the index of the conflicting event.\n\nThe `active_event_indices` set keeps track of the indices of ongoing events. When a new event does not conflict with any ongoing events, it is added to the set and its start time is printed. If at the end of the iteration there are no more active events (i.e., all events have finished) and no conflicts were detected, the function returns \"No conflicts\". Otherwise, if conflicts were detected or the list was empty, it returns \"Conflicts detected\" or \"No events\", respectively.","status":200,"tokens":[0,714],"elapsed":21.081845253,"_type":"aimessage"}]
