It first checks if there are any events at all, and if not, it returns \"No events\". If there are events, it sorts them by their start time to ensure efficient checking for conflicts.\n\nThe main loop iterates over each event, starting from the first one. For each event, it checks if any of the subsequent events (indexed from i+1) either start within the current event's finish time or end within its start time. If such a conflict is found, the function returns \"Conflict\".\n\nIf no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of events, the function returns \"No conflicts\". This approach ensures that each event is checked against all subsequent events in an efficient manner.","status":200,"tokens":[0,460],"elapsed":13.41338341,"_type":"aimessage"}]
