It uses the `Dates` package for parsing the dates and times. The function first sorts the events by their start time to ensure that they are processed in an order that allows for efficient conflict checking.\n\nThe main loop goes through each event starting from the second one (since the first event is considered to have no previous conflicts). For each event, it checks if its start time is before or on the same day as the finish time of the previous event. If so, it checks if there's an overlap between the current event and the previous one. If there is no overlap, the function continues to the next event.\n\nIf at any point a conflict is detected, the function returns `\"Conflict\"`. If all events are checked without finding any conflicts, it returns `\"No conflicts\"`. If the list of events is empty, it returns `\"No events\"`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,475],"elapsed":13.82867107,"_type":"aimessage"}]
