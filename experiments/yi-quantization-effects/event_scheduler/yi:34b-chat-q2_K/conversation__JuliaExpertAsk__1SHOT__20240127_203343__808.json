The function checks for conflicts by comparing the start and finish times of all events using Julia's built-in `DateTime` type. If there are no events, it returns \"No events\", otherwise it checks for conflicts and returns \"Conflict\" or \"No conflicts\" accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,458],"elapsed":11.835113124,"_type":"aimessage"}]
