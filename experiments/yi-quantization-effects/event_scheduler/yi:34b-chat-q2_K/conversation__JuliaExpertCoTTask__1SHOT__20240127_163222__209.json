Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    for (i, start1) in enumerate(events[1:end-1]), end1 in events[2:end]\n        if Dates.parse(start1) <= Dates.parse(end1) <= Dates.parse(start1 + 1h)\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\n# Testing\n\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events))  # Should output: \"No conflicts\"\n```\n\nPlease note that the `event_scheduler` function assumes that the list of events is sorted by start time, and it only checks for direct adjacency (no gaps).
