[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

If there are no events, we return a message indicating that there is nothing to schedule.\n2. We sort the events by their start time using an anonymous function `parse_date` which takes care of parsing the date strings into `DateTime` objects. This ensures that the comparison of dates works as expected.\n3. We iterate over the events, skipping the first one since it has no previous event to conflict with. For each iteration, we check if the current event's start time is less than or equal to the end time of the previous event plus a threshold of 30 minutes (to account for minor scheduling inaccuracies). If this condition is met, we have a conflict and return an appropriate message.\n\nThe `event_scheduler` function will throw an error if provided with events that are not tuples or if the tuple elements are not strings in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'. Therefore, it is recommended that the caller ensures valid data before calling this function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,386],"elapsed":10.093781653,"_type":"aimessage"}]
