Since the `Dates` package is mentioned for parsing, let's use it. However, since the latest date format (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`) is already in a valid ISO format, we don't need to parse it further using `Dates`â€”the built-in parser for Julia handles this format natively.\n\nHere's how you can define your function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    for (start1, finish1) in events\n        for (start2, finish2) in events\n            # Check if start2 is before or equal to finish1 and vice versa\n            if ((start2 <= start1 && finish2 >= start1) || \n                (start1 <= start2 && finish1 >= start2))\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nLet's break down the function:\n\n- If there are no events, we return `\"No events\"`.\n- For each event tuple in the list of events, we iterate over all other tuples and check if their start time is before or equal to the finish time of the current event or vice versa. If so, we have a conflict and return `\"Conflict\"`.\n- If no conflicts are found, we return `\"No conflicts\"`.\n\nNow let's test our function with the provided events:\n\n```julia\nevents_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\n\nThis should return `\"No conflicts\"` because the events do not overlap with each other.","status":200,"tokens":[0,485],"elapsed":12.605669591,"_type":"aimessage"}]
