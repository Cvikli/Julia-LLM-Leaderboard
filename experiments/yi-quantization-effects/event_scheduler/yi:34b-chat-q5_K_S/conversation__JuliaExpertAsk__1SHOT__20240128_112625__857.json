It uses the `Dates` package to parse these strings into Date objects for comparison. The algorithm checks for conflicts by iterating over all pairs of events (comparing each event with every other event), ensuring that there are no overlapping periods between the start and finish times of any pair of events. If no conflicts are found, it returns \"No conflicts\"; if a conflict is detected, it returns \"Conflict\"; and if the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,330],"elapsed":10.498109984,"_type":"aimessage"}]
