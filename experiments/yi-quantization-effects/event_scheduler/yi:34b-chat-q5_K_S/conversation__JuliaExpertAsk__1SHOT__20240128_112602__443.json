For each event, it checks if its start time is before or during the previous event's finish time. If so, there is a conflict, and the function returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it continues to check for conflicts with the next event until all events have been checked. If no conflicts are found, the function returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nIf the list of events is empty, the function returns \"No events\" to indicate there's nothing to schedule.","status":200,"tokens":[150,326],"elapsed":10.545675808,"_type":"aimessage"}]
