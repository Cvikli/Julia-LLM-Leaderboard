It uses the `Dates` package to parse these strings into `DateTime` objects. Then it checks for any scheduling conflicts by checking if the start time of any event is less than the finish time of another event that comes later in the list. If there are no such conflicts, the function returns \"No conflicts\"; otherwise, it returns \"Conflict\". If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[150,287],"elapsed":9.2978695,"_type":"aimessage"}]
