If so, it returns \"No events\". If there are events, it uses the `Dates` package to parse the start and finish times from strings into `DateTime` objects for easier comparison. It then checks for conflicts by comparing the start time of each event with the finish times of all other events and vice versa. If any overlap is detected, the function returns \"Conflict\"; otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[313,465],"elapsed":18.269347997,"_type":"aimessage"}]
