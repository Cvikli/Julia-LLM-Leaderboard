It uses the `Dates` package to parse these strings into `Date` and `Time` objects for comparison. The function checks for conflicts by iterating through all pairs of events and ensuring that there is no overlap between their start and finish times. If a conflict is found, it returns \"Conflict\"; otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\". If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,350],"elapsed":9.684592267,"_type":"aimessage"}]
