Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Each event is expected to be a tuple containing two dates in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'. The `parse` function from the `Dates` package is used to convert these strings into `DateTime` objects for comparison.\n\nThe algorithm compares every pair of events with each other. If the start time of one event is within the finish time of another, or vice versa, then a conflict is detected. If no conflicts are found, the function returns \"No conflicts\". If there are no events in the list, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,286],"elapsed":7.89028148,"_type":"aimessage"}]
