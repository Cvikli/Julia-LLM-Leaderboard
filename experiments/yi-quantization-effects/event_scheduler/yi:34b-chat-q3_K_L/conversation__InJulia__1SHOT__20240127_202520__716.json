If there is an overlap, it indicates a conflict. Here's how you can implement this in Julia using the `Dates` package:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction parse_time(str)\n    year, month, day, hour, minute = split(str, \":\")\n    return DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\").format(DateTime(year * \"-\" * month * \"-\" * day * \" \" * hour * \":\" * minute))\nend\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{Dates.TimeType, Dates.TimeType}})\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    else\n        for i in 1:length(events)-1\n            current_end = events[i][2]\n            next_start = events[i+1][1]\n            if current_end >= next_start\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n        return \"No conflicts\"\n    end\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nevents = [(parse_time(\"2023-05-14 09:00\"), parse_time(\"2023-05-14 11:30\")), (parse_time(\"2023-05-14 13:00\"), parse_time(\"2023-05-14 16:00\"))]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events))\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- The `parse_time` function is a custom function to parse the string format of the dates and times into `Dates.DateTime` objects. You can replace this with `Date.parse` if you prefer to use the standard library instead of writing your own parsing logic.\n- The `event_scheduler` function takes a list of events as input, each event being a tuple containing start and finish times. It then iteratively checks for overlap between the finish time of one event with the start time of the next event in the list. If an overlap is detected, it returns \"Conflict\".\n- The example usage shows how to call the `event_scheduler` function with a list of events and print the result.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that all times are provided in the same time zone. If you need to handle events across different time zones, you will need to account for that in your parsing and comparison logic.","status":200,"tokens":[0,605],"elapsed":16.836492738,"_type":"aimessage"}]
