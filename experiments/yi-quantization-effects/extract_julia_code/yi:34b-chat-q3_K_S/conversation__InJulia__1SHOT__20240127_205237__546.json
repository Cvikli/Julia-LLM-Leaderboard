Here's how you can extract Julia code blocks from a markdown document `md` and return a single string with the extracted code:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the markdown into lines to make it easier to parse.\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    # Initialize an array to hold the julia code blocks.\n    codes = Vector{String}()\n\n    # Loop through each line in the markdown document.\n    for (i, line) in enumerate(lines)\n        # If a line starts with '```julia', we have a code fence start.\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            # Initialize a variable to hold the extracted code block.\n            code = String()\n            # Skip the next few lines which are part of the code fences.\n            for j in i+1:min(i + 5, length(lines))  # Assuming at most 3 lines for the fence and EOL\n                if startswith(lines[j], \"```\") && endswith(lines[j], \"julia\")\n                    break\n                end\n            end\n            # If we have reached the end of the code fences without finding an ending '```',\n            # something is wrong with the markdown.\n            if j > i + 4  # Assuming at most 3 lines for the fence and EOL\n                error(\"Could not find matching '```' for $(i)th line: $line\")\n            end\n            # Append the code block to our result.\n            code *= join(lines[j+1:end], \"\\n\")  # Assuming at most 3 lines for the fence and EOL\n                    * \"\\n\"  # Add a newline after the code block.\n            # Increment i to skip the ending '```' and any subsequent empty lines.\n            i += j - (i + 1)\n        end\n        # If we have reached the end of the document without finding any more code blocks,\n        # return what we have.\n        if i == length(lines)\n            break\n        end\n        # Append the current line to our result if it's not part of a code fence.\n        code *= line * \"\\n\"\n    end\n    return code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by looking for lines starting with ````julia`, which indicate the start of a Julia code block, and then skips over the next few lines to find the matching closing `````. It then concatenates all the lines within these fences into a single string, including any subsequent blank lines after the code block but not including the ending ````` or its preceding blank lines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,626],"elapsed":16.764839675,"_type":"aimessage"}]
