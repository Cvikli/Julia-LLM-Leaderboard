It uses a regular expression to match code block delimiters (`~~~`), splits the document into lines, and then extracts the code blocks by looking for lines that start with three or more backticks (`\"``\"`). The extracted code blocks are joined together without any leading whitespace.","status":200,"tokens":[0,326],"elapsed":8.677246609,"_type":"aimessage"}]
