When it finds such a pair, it extracts the entire code block up to the closing `\"```\"`, removes the fences, and joins them with newlines.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes there are no nested code blocks or other syntax that could interfere with its logic. Also, it does not handle errors gracefully; if there's an error in the Markdown document, the behavior of the function might be unpredictable.","status":200,"tokens":[0,566],"elapsed":15.140230315,"_type":"aimessage"}]
