Below is an example of how you might implement such a function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regular expression to match 3 backticks and then 'julia' followed by 3 backticks.\n    regex = Regex(\"^(?:\\s*)(```julia)(?:\\r|\\n)?(?:[\\s\\S]*)?(?:\\r|\\n)?(?:```)(?:\\r|\\n)?(?:\\s*)?$\")\n    # Match all code blocks and join them together.\n    output = match.content[2] for m in eachmatch(regex, md)\n        m.captures[1] * \"\\n\" * m.captures[2]\n    end\n    return join(output, '\\n')\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all instances of ````julia` code blocks in the markdown document `md` and extracts their content, removing the code fences (`````) in the process. The captured content is then joined together with a newline character.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes there are no nested code blocks within the provided markdown document. If you need to handle nested code blocks or if the markdown contains more than one level of indentation, you would need to adjust the regular expression and logic accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,311],"elapsed":8.253928103,"_type":"aimessage"}]
