Below is an example implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```jl\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the markdown document into lines, retaining newlines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\"; keepempty=true)\n\n    # Initialize an array to hold the extracted code blocks\n    codeblocks = Vector{String}()\n\n    # Loop through each line in the markdown document\n    for (i, line) in enumerate(lines)\n        # If we find a start of a new code block, push the current one to our result\n        if startswith(line, \"```\") && occursin(\" julia\", line)\n            in_codeblock = true\n            codeblock_start = i + 1\n        end\n\n        # If we are in a code block and reach its end, process it and reset flags\n        if in_codeblock\n            if endswith(line, \"```\") && occursin(\" julia\", line)\n                in_codeblock = false\n                codeblock_end = i - 1\n            end\n        end\n\n        # If we are within a code block and not at its end, add the line to our result\n        if in_codeblock\n            push!(codeblocks, line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Join all the extracted code blocks together with newlines\n    joined_code = join(codeblocks)\n\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each line of the markdown document and detecting the start (`````) and end (`````) of a Julia code block. It then joins all the lines within a code block (after removing the initial ````` and final `````) and concatenates them with newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[85,412],"elapsed":11.093076301,"_type":"aimessage"}]
