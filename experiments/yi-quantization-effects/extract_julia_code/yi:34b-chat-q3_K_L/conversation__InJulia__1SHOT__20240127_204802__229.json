[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To extract Julia code blocks from a Markdown document in Julia, you can use the `Markdown` module provided by the standard library. Below is an example of how you might write the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Initialize the output string\n    output = \"\"\n\n    # Parse the Markdown document using the Markdown module\n    doc = Markdown.parse(md)\n\n    # Iterate over the elements of the document, looking for code blocks\n    for el in doc\n        # If the element is a code block, append it to the output string\n        if el isa Markdown.CodeBlock && el.info == \"julia\"\n            output *= replace(string(el), \"\\n```\\n\" => \"\") * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Remove leading and trailing whitespace from the output string\n    return strip(output)\nend\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. Initializes an `output` string where we'll store the extracted Julia code.\n2. Parses the Markdown document using the `Markdown` module provided by the standard library.\n3. Iterates over each element of the document.\n4. If the element is a `CodeBlock` with `\"julia\"` as its language identifier, it appends the content (without the code fences) to the output string.\n5. Removes leading and trailing whitespace from the output string using `strip()`.\n6. Returns the final string containing all the extracted Julia code blocks.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes there are no nested code blocks and that every code block has a language identifier of \"julia\". If your Markdown document has more complex structure, you might need to adjust the logic accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,410],"elapsed":11.322388982,"_type":"aimessage"}]
