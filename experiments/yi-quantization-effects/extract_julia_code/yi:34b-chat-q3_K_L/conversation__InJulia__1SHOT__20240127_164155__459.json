The following function will do what you ask:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the extracted code\n    output = \"\"\n\n    # Use a state machine to keep track of whether we're inside a code fence or not\n    state = :none\n    code_fence_open = false\n    code_block = \"\"\n\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if line == \"```julia\\n\"\n            state = :code_fence_opened\n            code_fence_open = true\n            continue\n        end\n        if state == :none && line == \"```\\n\"\n            # Ignore a closing code fence if there's no corresponding opening one\n            if !code_fence_open\n                state = :none\n                continue\n            end\n        end\n        if state == :code_fence_opened\n            if line == \"```\\n\"\n                state = :none\n                output *= code_block * \"\\n\"  # Add a newline after the last code block\n                continue\n            end\n            code_block *= line * \"\\n\"  # Append the line to the current code block\n        end\n    end\n\n    return output\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by keeping track of whether it's inside a code fence or not. It uses a state machine with three states: `:none`, `:code_fence_opened`, and `:inside_code_block`. When the opening code fence (````julia\\n`) is encountered, the state changes to `:code_fence_opened`, and the following lines are appended to the `code_block` variable until a closing code fence (````\\n`) is found. After each code block, a newline character is added to the output string.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no nested code blocks and that the provided markdown document is well-formed. It also assumes that all code blocks are written in Julia language, as specified by the ````julia` fence.\n\nTo use this function, simply call it with your markdown document string:\n\n```julia\nmd_document = \"\"\"\n# This is a markdown document\n\n```julia\na = 1\nb = 2\nc = a + b\n```\n\nMore text...\n\n```julia\nd = 3\ne = 4\nf = d * e\n```\n\nEven more text...\n\"\"\"\n\nextracted_code = extract_julia_code(md_document)\nprintln(extracted_code)  # This will print the extracted Julia code blocks without the fences and with line breaks between them\n```\n\nThis will output something like:\n\n```julia\na = 1\nb = 2\nc = a + b\n\nd = 3\ne = 4\nf = d * e\n```\n\nRemember to adjust the function according to your specific needs, such as handling nested code blocks or code fences for other languages.","status":200,"tokens":[85,729],"elapsed":20.418966656,"_type":"aimessage"}]
