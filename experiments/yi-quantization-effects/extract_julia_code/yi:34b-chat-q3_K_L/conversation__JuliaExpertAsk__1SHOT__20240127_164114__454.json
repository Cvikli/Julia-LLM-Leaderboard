Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Your solution here\nend\n```\n\nPlease note that without an example, it's difficult to test the function. However, I can provide you with a general idea of how such a function might work:\n\n1. Use `Markdown.parse` to convert the Markdown document into an abstract syntax tree (AST).\n2. Traverse the AST and identify all code blocks.\n3. For each code block, remove the code fences (the three backticks on each line).\n4. If there are multiple code blocks, join them together with a newline.\n5. Convert the modified content back to a string.\n\nHere's an example of how you might implement this function:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    ast = Markdown.parse(md)\n\n    # Find all code blocks in the AST\n    code_blocks = findall(x -> x isa Markdown.Code, ast)\n\n    # Iterate over each code block and remove fences, then join them together\n    joined_code = \"\"\n    for block in code_blocks\n        lines = [Markdown.content(block)[1].text for block in block.parent.children[2:end]] # Assuming there are no nested code blocks\n        fence_length = length(lines[1]) - 3 # Adjust this if there's a different number of backticks used for fences\n        joined_code *= replace(join(lines, \"\\n\"), r\"^\\`\\`\\`|(\\n|^)\\`\\`\\$\"m => \"\")[fence_length+1:end] # Remove the first and last lines that contain the code fences\n    end\n\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function assumes that there are no nested code blocks within the provided Markdown document. If there might be, you would need to adjust the logic accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,449],"elapsed":12.423561619,"_type":"aimessage"}]
