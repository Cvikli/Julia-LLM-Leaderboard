For each match, it captures the content inside the code block and then removes any unnecessary newlines (more than two consecutive newlines are replaced with a single newline). Finally, it appends all the clean code blocks together with a newline in between them. The resulting string is returned as the extracted Julia code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,336],"elapsed":9.249329682,"_type":"aimessage"}]
