[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Below is an example of how you might implement such a function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regular expression to match code fences with the language \"julia\"\n    re = Regex(r\"```julia\\n([\\w\\W]+?)\\n```\", \"m\")\n\n    # Match all occurrences of `re` in the markdown document\n    code_blocks = matchall(re, md)\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the extracted code blocks\n    code = \"\"\n\n    # Loop over each matched code block and append it to `code` after removing the fences\n    for block in code_blocks\n        # Get the text inside the code fence, which is the second group of the match\n        code *= replace(block.captures[1], \"\\n\" => \"\") * \"\\n\"\n    end\n\n    return code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all code blocks with the `julia` language identifier. It then extracts the text inside these code blocks and joins them together with a newline character. The result is a string containing all the extracted Julia code, without the surrounding triple backticks.\n\nPlease note that this example assumes you are working with a raw markdown document (i.e., an `AbstractString`) as input. If you're actually parsing a Markdown document using a parser like `Markdown.parse` or `MDParse.parse`, you would need to adapt the function accordingly.\n\nAlso, this example does not handle nested code blocks or other potential complexities that might arise in real-world markdown documents. It's a simple solution for the provided description.","status":200,"tokens":[0,386],"elapsed":10.660467356,"_type":"aimessage"}]
