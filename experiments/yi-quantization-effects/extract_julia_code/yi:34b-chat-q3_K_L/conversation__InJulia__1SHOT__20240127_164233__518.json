Below is an example of how you could write the function `extract_julia_code` in Julia to extract all the Julia code blocks from a markdown document and return them as a single string without the code fences:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Initialize an empty result string\n    result = \"\"\n\n    # Regular expressions for matching code fence openers, closers, and content\n    code_fence_open = r\"^\\s*`{3,}\\n\"\n    code_fence_close = r\"\\n\\s*`{3,}\"\n    in_code_block = false\n\n    # Loop over the lines of the markdown document\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        # Check if we are starting a code block\n        if match(code_fence_open, line) !== nothing\n            in_code_block = true\n            continue\n        end\n\n        # Check if we are ending a code block\n        if match(code_fence_close, line) !== nothing\n            in_code_block = false\n            continue\n        end\n\n        # If we are in a code block, add the line to the result\n        if in_code_block\n            result *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Remove leading and trailing whitespace from the result\n    return strip(result)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to match code fence openers (`^` signifies the start of a line, `\\s*` matches any number of whitespace characters, ``{3,}` matches three or more backticks) and closers. It also maintains a boolean `in_code_block` to track whether we are within a code block. The function iterates over each line in the markdown document and adds lines that are inside a code block to the result string.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no nested code blocks and that the language identifier for Julia code blocks is not used (since you specified \"julia language code blocks\" without any examples, I'm assuming that the language identifier is not relevant). If you have nested code blocks or if the language identifier is important, the logic would need to be adapted accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,510],"elapsed":14.100438453,"_type":"aimessage"}]
