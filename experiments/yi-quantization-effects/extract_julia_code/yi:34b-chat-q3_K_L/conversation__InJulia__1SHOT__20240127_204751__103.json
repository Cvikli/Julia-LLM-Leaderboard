Here's a function you can use to extract Julia code blocks from a Markdown document:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regular expression for code fences in markdown (start and end sequences)\n    code_fence = r\"^( *)(`{3,}`)\\n?((?:(?!\\1).)*)\\n?\\2\"m\n\n    # Match all code fences with content inside\n    matches = matchall(code_fence, md)\n\n    # Extract the code blocks and join them together\n    julia_code = \"\"\n    for m in matches\n        # The third capture group is the actual code block content\n        code_block = m.captures[3]\n        # Remove leading whitespace from start of line\n        code_block = replace(code_block, r\"^\\s+\" => \"\")\n        # Append to the julia_code with a newline if there's more than one code block\n        if length(julia_code) > 0\n            julia_code *= \"\\n\"\n        end\n        julia_code *= code_block\n    end\n\n    return julia_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression to match code fences (lines that start with three or more backticks) and captures the content between them. It then iterates over all matches, removing leading whitespace from each line of the code block, and joins the blocks together by appending a newline if there are multiple code blocks in the document.\n\nTo use this function, you would simply call it with your Markdown string `md` as an argument:\n\n```julia\n#假设您已经有了一个名为 'md' 的字符串，它包含了包含 Julia 代码块的 Markdown 文档。\n\njulia_code = extract_julia_code(md)\n```\n\nThis will give you a string containing all the Julia code blocks from the original Markdown document, with any surrounding code fences removed and the code blocks joined together.","status":200,"tokens":[0,465],"elapsed":12.875443641,"_type":"aimessage"}]
