[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String.

To extract Julia code blocks from a Markdown document in a way that removes the surrounding triple backticks and concatenates them, you can use the following function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the markdown into lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n\n    # Initialize an output string\n    out_str = \"\"\n\n    # Loop through each line of the document\n    for (i, line) in enumerate(lines)\n        if startswith(line, r\"```julia\") || endswith(line, r\"```\")\n            # If we find a code fence, we will ignore this line and any following lines until the matching code fence is found\n            if startswith(line, r\"```julia\")\n                # Start of a code block - increment the level to indicate we're inside a code block\n                level = i + 1\n            else\n                # End of a code block - decrement the level and check if it reached zero (meaning we've finished processing the code block)\n                level -= 1\n                if level == 0\n                    # If we're not inside a code block, append the line to the output string\n                    out_str *= \"\\n\" * replace(lines[i], r\"```julia\" => \"\")\n                end\n            end\n        elseif level > 0  # If we're inside a code block\n            out_str *= \"\\n\" * replace(line, r\"```julia\" => \"\")\n        end\n    end\n\n    return out_str\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the Markdown document into lines and then processing each line based on whether it starts or ends a code block (indicated by ````julia` and `````). When a code fence is encountered, we keep track of the nesting level to know when to append lines to the output string.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the Markdown document is well-formed, meaning that each opening code fence has a matching closing code fence, and that there are no nested code blocks. If you encounter more complex Markdown documents with nested code blocks or other block elements, you may need to adjust the logic accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,514],"elapsed":14.220539171,"_type":"aimessage"}]
