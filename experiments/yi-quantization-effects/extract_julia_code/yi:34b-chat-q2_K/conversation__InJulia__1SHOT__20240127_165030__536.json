Once you have the content as an AbstractString, you can write a simple function to remove the code fences (`````) and join the code blocks together with a newline. Below is an example implementation of such a function using the `MarkdownParse` package:\n\nFirst, let's add the `MarkdownParse` package to our environment if it's not already present:\n\n```julia\nusing Pkg; Pkg.add(\"MarkdownParse\")\n```\n\nNow, we can define our function that extracts Julia code blocks from a Markdown document:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Parse the markdown with fenced codes and remove leading/trailing whitespace\n    output = MarkdownParse.parse_with_fenced_code(md)[2]\n    # Remove leading ` from each line if present\n    output = replace(output, r\"^\\s*```\\n\" => \"\")\n    # Remove trailing ` from each line if present\n    output = replace(output, r\"\\s*```$\" => \"\")\n    # Join the code blocks with newlines\n    return join(split(output), \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function `extract_julia_code` takes a string `md` containing Markdown content and returns an extracted string without the code fences. Note that this function assumes there are no nested fenced code blocks. If you have examples or other blocks in your document, they will be included as well. To handle such cases, additional parsing might be required.\n\nTo use this function with your own Markdown document:\n\n```julia\nmd_document = \"\"\"\n# This is my markdown document\n\n```julia\nlet's extract some code!\n```\n\nMore content...\n\"\"\"\n\nextracted_code = extract_julia_code(md_document)\nprintln(extracted_code) # Print the extracted Julia code block without fences\n```\n\nPlease note that the `MarkdownParse` package may have different versions or be updated over time, so ensure you are using the latest version for accurate parsing.","status":200,"tokens":[0,518],"elapsed":13.308065009,"_type":"aimessage"}]
