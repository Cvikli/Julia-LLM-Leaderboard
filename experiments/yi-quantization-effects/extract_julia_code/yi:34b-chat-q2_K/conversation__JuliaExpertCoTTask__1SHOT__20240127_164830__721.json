Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the function that extracts all Julia code blocks from a markdown document and returns a string with the contents of those code blocks:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the markdown into lines, removing the initial blank line if present\n    lines = String.(split(md, \"\\n\"))\n    # Remove leading and trailing blank lines\n    while length(lines) > 1 && isempty(lines[1])\n        deleteat!(lines, 1)\n    end\n    while length(lines) > 1 && isempty(lines[end])\n        pop!(lines)\n    end\n    # Loop through the lines and construct the output string\n    output = \"\"\n    in_codeblock = false\n    for (i, line) in enumerate(lines)\n        if line == \"```julia\\n\"\n            in_codeblock = true\n        elseif in_codeblock\n            if line == \"\\n\" || line == \"```\\n\"\n                in_codeblock = false\n            else\n                output *= line\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return output\nend\n```\n\nThis function expects the markdown document as a string and returns the extracted Julia code as a string.
