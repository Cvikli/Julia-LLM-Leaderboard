Finds ````` at the start of a line to indicate the beginning of a code block.\n2. Skips lines until it finds ````\\n` (including the newline) to indicate the end of the code block.\n3. Joins all the extracted code blocks together with newlines.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no nested code blocks within the provided markdown document. If you encounter such a scenario, it may be necessary to enhance the function to handle nested structures appropriately.","status":200,"tokens":[0,404],"elapsed":10.394473352,"_type":"aimessage"}]
