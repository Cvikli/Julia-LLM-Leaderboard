It then captures the content inside these code fences using group 1 of the regex. After matching all occurrences, it concatenates the captured strings together with an empty string as a separator.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no nested code blocks and that the markdown document does not contain any leading or trailing whitespace that could affect the extraction. It also assumes that there are no other types of code blocks (e.g., ````plaintext`, ````html`) mixed with Julia code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[85,313],"elapsed":10.09790512,"_type":"aimessage"}]
