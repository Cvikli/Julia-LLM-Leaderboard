It captures the content between these fences and then removes leading and trailing whitespace from each line before joining them together with a newline. The final result is a string containing all the extracted julia code blocks concatenated with newlines in between.","status":200,"tokens":[0,368],"elapsed":11.695366566,"_type":"aimessage"}]
