It then captures the content between these fences and removes any leading or trailing whitespace before joining all the code blocks together with a newline.\n\nTo use this function, simply call it with your Markdown document string:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# This is a markdown document\n\n```julia\nsome julia code here\n```\n\n```julia\nand another one here\n```\n\"\"\"\n\nextracted_code = extract_julia_code(md)\nprintln(extracted_code) # Output: some julia code here and another one here\n```\n\nThis will print out the extracted Julia code blocks with a newline between them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,383],"elapsed":12.160466503,"_type":"aimessage"}]
