[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

When a code block is detected as starting or ending, the boolean `in_codeblock` is set accordingly. The main loop then appends each line to the output string based on this status.\n\nTo test this function, you can use it within a Julia REPL or script:\n\n```julia\nusing Test\n\nmd = \"\"\"# Some Markdown Document\n\n```julia\nsome code here\n```\n\nMore text...\n\n```julia\nand more code here\n```\n\nEnd of document.\"\"\"\n\n@test extract_julia_code(md) == \"\"\"\\\nsome code here\nand more code here\n\"\"\"\n```\n\nMake sure to import `Test` and use the `@test` macro to assert that the output is correct for a given input.","status":200,"tokens":[0,404],"elapsed":13.029037152,"_type":"aimessage"}]
