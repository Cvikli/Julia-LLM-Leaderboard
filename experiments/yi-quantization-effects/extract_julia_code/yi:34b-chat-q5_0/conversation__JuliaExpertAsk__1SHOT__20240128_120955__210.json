It then iterates over each line in the markdown document and appends the content of the code block (without the opening and closing code fences) to the extracted code string. If the line is not part of a code block, it is ignored. Finally, the function returns the joined code blocks as a single string with newlines between them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,387],"elapsed":12.305535922,"_type":"aimessage"}]
