Once you have the code blocks, you can remove the code fences (````julia`) and join them together with a newline. Here's how you could implement `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Parse the Markdown document into an AST\n    ast = Markdown.parse(md)\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to hold the extracted Julia code\n    extracted_code = \"\"\n\n    # Traverse the AST and look for code blocks with 'julia' language identifier\n    for node in ast\n        if isa(node, Markdown.Code) && node.info == \"julia\"\n            # Remove the leading and trailing code fences from the code block\n            code_block = replace(string(node.content), r\"^```julia\\n|\\n```julia$\" => \"\")\n            # Add a newline at the end of the current extracted code if there's already some\n            if extracted_code != \"\"\n                extracted_code *= \"\\n\"\n            end\n            # Append the code block to the extracted code\n            extracted_code *= code_block\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return the extracted Julia code\n    return extracted_code\nend\n```\n\nTo use this function, simply pass in your Markdown document string as an argument:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# This is a markdown document with Julia code blocks\n\n```julia\nfunction fibonacci(n)\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    for i in 1:n\n        print(a)\n        a, b = b, a + b\n    end\n    return a\nend\n```\n\nMore text...\n\"\"\"\n\nextracted_code = extract_julia_code(md)\nprintln(extracted_code)\n```\n\nThis will print out the extracted Julia code without the ````julia` fences and with each code block separated by a newline:\n\n```julia\nfunction fibonacci(n)\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    for i in 1:n\n        print(a)\n        a, b = b, a + b\n    end\n    return a\nend\n```\n\nNote that this function assumes there are no nested code blocks and that all the code blocks you want to extract have the `\"julia\"` language identifier. If your Markdown document has other kinds of content or more complex structures, you might need to adjust the traversal logic accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[85,639],"elapsed":20.589646438,"_type":"aimessage"}]
