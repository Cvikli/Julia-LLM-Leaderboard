[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

It then filters out only the lines that start with ````julia`, which indicates the start of a Julia code block in Markdown. If there are no such lines, the function returns an empty string.\n\nNext, it finds the starting and ending indices of the first and last code blocks using the `findfirst` and `findlast` functions. These indices are adjusted to exclude the opening and closing code fences (````julia` and `````) themselves. Finally, it joins all the lines within these indices and appends a newline character.\n\nThe `join(lines[start_index:end_index])` statement is used to concatenate the content of the code blocks without any delimiter, which is why we add an additional newline at the end with `* \"\\n\"`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,345],"elapsed":11.121937211,"_type":"aimessage"}]
