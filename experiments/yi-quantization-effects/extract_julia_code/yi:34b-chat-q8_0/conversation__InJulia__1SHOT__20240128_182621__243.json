The following function `extract_julia_code` does this by matching code blocks that start with ````julia` and end with `````, removing the fences, and joining the code blocks together with a newline.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regular expression to match Julia code blocks\n    pattern = r\"```julia[\\s\\S]*?```\"m\n\n    # Use capture groups to keep the text between the fences\n    # (?s) allows matching across newlines\n    matches = matchall(pattern, md)\n\n    # Join all matches together and remove leading/trailing whitespace\n    code_blocks = join([m.match for m in matches], \"\\n\")\n    trimmed_code_blocks = replace(code_blocks, r\"^\\s+|\\s+$\" => \"\")\n\n    return trimmed_code_blocks\nend\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. Defines a regular expression to match Julia code blocks with the `m` flag for multiline matching and the `\\s*?` to make the space between `julia` and the opening fence non-greedy.\n2. Uses `matchall()` to find all instances of the pattern in the Markdown document.\n3. Joins the matches together with a newline character using `join([m.match for m in matches], \"\\n\")`.\n4. Removes leading and trailing whitespace from the joined code blocks using `replace(code_blocks, r\"^\\s+|\\s+$\" => \"\")`.\n\nTo use this function, you simply call it with your Markdown document string as an argument:\n\n```julia\nmd = read(\"example.md\", String) # Replace with your file path\njulia_code = extract_julia_code(md)\nprintln(julia_code) # Print the extracted Julia code\n```\n\nIf you have any Markdown documents that include Julia code blocks, you can test this function by providing those documents as input.","status":200,"tokens":[85,485],"elapsed":21.982680565,"_type":"aimessage"}]
