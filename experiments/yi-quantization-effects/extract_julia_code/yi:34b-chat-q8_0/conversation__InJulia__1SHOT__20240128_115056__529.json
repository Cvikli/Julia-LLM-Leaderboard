However, for this specific task, I'll assume that we have a simple markdown document with no other elements except for the code blocks in Julia language.\n\nHere's an example function that uses regular expressions to extract all the code blocks and join them together:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regular expression to match a code block in markdown\n    # This regex assumes that there are no other elements in the markdown document\n    # and that the language is specified as \"julia\". Adjust accordingly for your use case.\n    code_block_rx = r\"```julia\\n(?:\\s*\\n)?((?:[^\\n]+\\n)*)```\"m\n    \n    # Initialize an empty string to hold the extracted code\n    output = \"\"\n    \n    # Loop through each match in the document\n    for match in eachmatch(code_block_rx, md)\n        # Get the content of the code block without the fences\n        code = match.captures[1]\n        \n        # Remove leading and trailing whitespace from the code block\n        code = strip(code)\n        \n        # Append the code to the output with a newline if there's already some text\n        if !isempty(output)\n            output *= \"\\n\"\n        end\n        \n        # Append the code to the output\n        output *= code\n    end\n    \n    return output\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression to match each ````julia` code block with or without leading blank lines. It captures the content of the code block and strips any leading and trailing whitespace. Then it joins all the captured code blocks together with a newline in between.\n\nPlease note that this function is designed for a very specific use case where the markdown document only contains ````julia` code blocks without other elements like headers, lists, etc. If your markdown documents are more complex, you might need to use a full-featured markdown parser or adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,483],"elapsed":21.733342842,"_type":"aimessage"}]
