Here's how you could define the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Initialize an empty string to hold the extracted code\n    extracted_code = \"\"\n\n    # Iterate over each line in the Markdown document\n    for line in split(md, '\\n')\n        if startswith(line, '```julia')  # Check for opening Julia code fence\n            in_code_block = true\n            continue  # Skip this line since it's the code fence itself\n        end\n\n        if in_code_block && endswith(line, '```')  # Check for closing Julia code fence\n            in_code_block = false\n            continue  # Skip this line since it's the code fence itself\n        end\n\n        if !in_code_block || line == \"\\n\"  # Skip blank lines and non-code block content\n            continue\n        end\n\n        extracted_code *= line  # Append the line to the extracted code\n        extracted_code *= '\\n'  # Add a newline after each line except the last one\n    end\n\n    # Remove the leading and trailing newlines, if any\n    return strip(extracted_code)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works as follows:\n\n1. It starts with an empty string `extracted_code` to store the extracted code.\n2. For each line in the Markdown document, it checks whether the line is part of a Julia code block by looking for the opening and closing code fences (````julia` and `````).\n3. If a line is not within a code block or if it's a blank line, it is skipped.\n4. For each line within a Julia code block, the function appends the line to `extracted_code`, adding a newline character after each line except the last one. This ensures that the extracted code has proper line breaks but without an extra newline at the end.\n5. Finally, it strips leading and trailing whitespace from the extracted code to remove any potential newlines or spaces at the beginning or end of the string.\n\nTo use this function, you simply call it with your Markdown document `md` as a String:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\n# Example Markdown document with Julia code blocks\nmd = \"\"\"\n# My Document Title\n\nSome text before the code block\n\n```julia\nfunction add(a, b)\n    return a + b\nend\n```\n\nMore text after the code block\n\n```julia\nadd(1, 2)  # This is an example call to the `add` function\n```\n\"\"\"\n\n# Extract the Julia code blocks\njulia_code = extract_julia_code(md)\nprintln(julia_code)\n```\n\nThis will output the extracted Julia code blocks, joined together with newlines:\n\n```julia\nfunction add(a, b)\n    return a + b\nend\n\nadd(1, 2)  # This is an example call to the `add` function\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,743],"elapsed":33.573539473,"_type":"aimessage"}]
