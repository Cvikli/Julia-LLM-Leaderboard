It then captures the language name and the body of the code block using capturing groups in the regex.\n\nThe function iterates over each line in the markdown document and looks for matches to the regex. When a match is found, it extracts the language name (which is used to determine that it's a Julia code block) and the body of the code block, which is joined with the newline character. The code fences are removed by stripping leading and trailing `>` characters from each line in the code block body.\n\nFinally, all extracted code blocks are concatenated together with a newline between them to maintain proper formatting.","status":200,"tokens":[0,456],"elapsed":14.541740501,"_type":"aimessage"}]
