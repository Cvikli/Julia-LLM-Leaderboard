Here's an example function that does this:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regular expression for finding code fences with the language \"julia\"\n    language_regex = r\"^```julia\"\n    end_of_code_block_regex = r\"^```\\s*$\"\n\n    # Split the document into lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to hold the extracted code\n    extracted_code = \"\"\n\n    # Loop through each line of the document\n    for (i, line) in enumerate(lines)\n        # If we find a start of a code block with the Julia language\n        if occursin(language_regex, line)\n            # Start the code block extraction process\n            code_block = \"\"\n            # Append the current line to the code block\n            code_block *= line\n            # Increment the index to skip the next line (the empty line after the code fence)\n            i += 1\n        elseif occursin(end_of_code_block_regex, line)\n            # If we find the end of a code block\n            # Append the extracted code to the final result and reset the code block\n            extracted_code *= code_block * \"\\n\"\n            code_block = \"\"\n        else\n            # Otherwise, append the current line to the code block\n            code_block *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return extracted_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses two regular expressions: one for finding the start of a Julia code block (`^```julia`) and another for finding the end of a code block (`^```\\s*$`). It then iterates over each line in the document, appending lines that are not part of a code fence to `extracted_code` directly. When it finds a start or an end of a code block, it takes appropriate action:\n\n- If it's the start of a code block, it initializes a new string for the code block content and increments the line index to skip the next line (which is usually an empty line after the opening code fence).\n- If it's the end of a code block, it appends the code block content to `extracted_code` and resets the code block string.\n- For all other lines, it just appends them to the current code block string.\n\nFinally, it returns the `extracted_code`, which contains all the Julia code blocks from the Markdown document joined together with newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,615],"elapsed":19.758825161,"_type":"aimessage"}]
