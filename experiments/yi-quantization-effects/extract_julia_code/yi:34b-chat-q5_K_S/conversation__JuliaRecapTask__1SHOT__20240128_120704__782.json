[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

It is important to account for case insensitivity since markdown is typically case-insensitive when it comes to headers and code blocks.\n\nTo use this function, you would call it like so:\n\n```julia\nmd_content = \"\"\"\n# My Document Title\n\nHere is some text.\n\n```julia\nfunction myfunc(x)\n    return x + 1\nend\n```\n\nMore text.\n\n``` Julia\nmyfunc(3) # Output: 4\n```\n\nAnd even more text.\n\"\"\"\n\nextracted_code = extract_julia_code(md_content)\nprintln(extracted_code)\n# Output should be something like:\n# function myfunc(x)\n#     return x + 1\n# end\n# myfunc(3) # Output: 4\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,550],"elapsed":17.781379915,"_type":"aimessage"}]
