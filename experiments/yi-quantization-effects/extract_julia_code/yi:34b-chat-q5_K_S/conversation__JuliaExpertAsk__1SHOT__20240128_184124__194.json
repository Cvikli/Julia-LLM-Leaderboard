For each match, it captures the contents of the code block and removes the surrounding code fences (`````) and newlines. Finally, it joins all the extracted code blocks together with a newline between them and returns the result as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,304],"elapsed":9.654225266,"_type":"aimessage"}]
