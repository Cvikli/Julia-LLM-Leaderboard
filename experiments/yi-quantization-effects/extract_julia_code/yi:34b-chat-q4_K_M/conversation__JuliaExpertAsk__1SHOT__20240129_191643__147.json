It then replaces these code blocks with empty strings and joins all the lines together without any leading or trailing whitespace. The `m` flag on the regular expression makes it case-insensitive, and the `\\n` in the substitution is an escape character for a newline.","status":200,"tokens":[0,239],"elapsed":6.939169138,"_type":"aimessage"}]
