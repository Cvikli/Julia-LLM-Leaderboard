It then iterates through each line of the markdown document, appending the content of the code block to an output string while removing the code fences. Once all code blocks are extracted and concatenated, any leading or trailing whitespace is removed from the output.","status":200,"tokens":[0,373],"elapsed":10.796428297,"_type":"aimessage"}]
