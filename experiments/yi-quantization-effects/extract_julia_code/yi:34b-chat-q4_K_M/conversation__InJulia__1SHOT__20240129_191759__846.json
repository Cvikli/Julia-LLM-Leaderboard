Here's how you can define the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Parse the markdown document into an Abstract syntax tree\n    doc = Markdown.parse(md)\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to hold the extracted code\n    extracted_code = \"\"\n\n    # Traverse the doc and look for code blocks with language 'julia'\n    for i in eachindex(doc)\n        node = doc[i]\n        if isa(node, Markdown.CodeBlock) && node.info == \"julia\"\n            # Append the code block to the extracted code\n            extracted_code *= node.text\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Remove the leading and trailing whitespace from the extracted code\n    return strip(extracted_code)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a `String` `md` as input, parses it into an abstract syntax tree using `Markdown.parse`, and then iterates over each node in the tree. When it finds a `CodeBlock` with language `julia`, it appends the text of the code block to the `extracted_code` string. After all the code blocks have been processed, it strips leading and trailing whitespace from the extracted code and returns it as a `String`.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes there are no nested code blocks and that all code blocks are written in Julia. If you need to handle more complex Markdown documents with nested code blocks or different types of content within the code blocks, you may need to write a more sophisticated parser.","status":200,"tokens":[0,416],"elapsed":12.090553312,"_type":"aimessage"}]
