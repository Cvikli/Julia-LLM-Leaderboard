It then iterates through each match, removing the leading and trailing whitespace from the content, and appending it to an empty string. The newline at the beginning of each iteration is added to ensure that the extracted code blocks are separated by a newline character.","status":200,"tokens":[0,281],"elapsed":8.148787497,"_type":"aimessage"}]
