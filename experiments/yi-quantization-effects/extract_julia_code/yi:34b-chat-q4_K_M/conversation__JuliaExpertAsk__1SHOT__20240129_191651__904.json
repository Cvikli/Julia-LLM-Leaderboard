It then iterates over each match, strips any leading and trailing newlines from the code block, and joins all the code blocks together with a newline character. Finally, it returns the string containing the extracted Julia code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,267],"elapsed":7.737105291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
