For each match, it removes the leading and trailing newline characters using `replace` with the specified substitution. Finally, it concatenates all the code blocks together with an extra newline character in between to ensure that the extracted code is properly formatted as a single block of code when returned as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,263],"elapsed":7.444163511,"_type":"aimessage"}]
