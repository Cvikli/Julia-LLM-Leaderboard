Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String.

Here's an example of how you might write a function `extract_julia_code` to do this:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regular expression for Julia code blocks with syntax highlighting\n    julia_code_block = r\"```julia\\n([^\\n]+)\\n```\"m\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to hold the extracted code\n    output = \"\"\n\n    # Loop through each match of the Julia code block regex and append the content to output\n    for m in eachmatch(julia_code_block, md)\n        # Get the captured group with the code content\n        code_content = m.captures[1]\n\n        # Remove the leading and trailing whitespace from the code content\n        clean_code_content = replace(code_content, r\"^\\s+|\\s+$\" => \"\")\n\n        # Append the clean code content to the output string with a newline\n        output *= \"\\n\" * clean_code_content * \"\\n\"\n    end\n\n    return output\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression `julia_code_block` to match Julia code blocks that start with ````julia` and end with `````. It captures the content between these fences and then removes leading and trailing whitespace from each block before joining them together with newlines.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes there are no nested code blocks and that every occurrence of ````julia` followed by a newline is the start of a new Julia code block. If your Markdown document contains non-Julia code blocks or if the structure of the code blocks is more complex, you may need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,420],"elapsed":11.890463128,"_type":"aimessage"}]
