Here's how you might implement the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Parse the markdown document into an AST\n    ast = Markdown.parse(md)\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the extracted code\n    output = \"\"\n\n    # Traverse the AST and look for code blocks\n    for node in ast\n        if isa(node, Markdown.CodeBlock) && node.info == \"julia\"\n            # Remove the code fences (```julia) from the beginning and end of the code block\n            code = replace(String(node.content), r\"^`{3}julia$|^`{3}$\" => \"\")\n            # Join consecutive code blocks with a newline if they're separated by blank lines\n            if occursin(r\"\\n\\s*\\n\", code)\n                code = replace(code, r\"\\n\\s*\\n\" => \"\\n\")\n            end\n            # Append the code to the output\n            output *= code * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return output\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a `String` containing Markdown content and returns another `String` with all the extracted Julia code blocks joined together. It does this by parsing the markdown document into an AST, then finding `CodeBlock` nodes with `info == \"julia\"`. The code fences are removed using `replace`, and consecutive code blocks are joined with a newline if they're separated by blank lines.\n\nTo use the function, you simply call it with your Markdown document string:\n\n```julia\nmd_doc = \"\"\"\n# My Document\n\n```julia\nfunction myfunc()\n    println(\"Hello, World!\")\nend\n```\n\n```julia\nmyfunc()\n```\n\nMore text...\n\"\"\"\n\nextracted_code = extract_julia_code(md_doc)\n```\n\nThe `extracted_code` variable will now contain the combined Julia code from both code blocks in the Markdown document:\n\n```julia\nfunction myfunc()\n    println(\"Hello, World!\")\nend\n\nmyfunc()\n```\n\nRemember that this function assumes there are no other code blocks with different languages or non-standard fence characters. It also doesn't handle nested code blocks or other Markdown elements inside the Julia code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[0,617],"elapsed":23.020595261,"_type":"aimessage"}]
