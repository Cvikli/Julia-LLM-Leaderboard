When it encounters a line that starts with `'```julia'`, it sets a flag to indicate that we are now inside a Julia code block. Conversely, when it finds a line that starts with just `'```'`, it resets the flag to indicate that we have exited the code block. Inside a code block, each line is appended to the extracted code string with a newline character. After iterating through all lines, the leading and trailing newlines are stripped from the extracted code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,370],"elapsed":13.738551979,"_type":"aimessage"}]
