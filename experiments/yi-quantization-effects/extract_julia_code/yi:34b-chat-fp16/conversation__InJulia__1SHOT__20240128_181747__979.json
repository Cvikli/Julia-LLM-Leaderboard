Here's how you can write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks with Julia language and returns a string with the joined code blocks:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regular expression to match a code fence with the language specified\n    language_regex = r\"^```julia\"m\n    end_of_line_regex = r\"\\r?\\n\"\n    \n    # Use a capture group to get the content between the code fences\n    code_block_regex = Regex(\"`{3}julia(\\s|$(end_of_line_regex)*)?((?:.*?(?=`{3}\\s*julia\\b|$))*)\")\n    \n    # Initialize an empty string to hold the extracted code blocks\n    extracted_code = \"\"\n    \n    # Loop through each match of the code block regex\n    for match in eachmatch(code_block_regex, md)\n        # Get the captured group with the content\n        content = match.captures[3]\n        \n        # Remove the leading and trailing whitespace from the content\n        clean_content = replace(content, r\"^\\s+|\\s+$\" => \"\")\n        \n        # Append the clean content to the extracted code\n        extracted_code *= clean_content * \"\\n\"\n    end\n    \n    return extracted_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function:\n\n1. Defines a regular expression to match the start of a Julia code block (`^```julia`).\n2. Uses `eachmatch` to find all matches of the code block regex in the Markdown document `md`.\n3. For each match, it captures and extracts the content between the code fences using the third capture group.\n4. Removes leading and trailing whitespace from the extracted content.\n5. Appends the clean content to the string holding all the extracted code blocks, with a newline character in between.\n6. Finally, it returns the string with all the joined Julia code blocks.\n\nTo use this function, simply call `extract_julia_code(md)` with your Markdown document `md` as an argument. The function will return the extracted and joined Julia code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[85,530],"elapsed":41.179901279,"_type":"aimessage"}]
