Here's how you could implement the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Parse the Markdown document into an AST\n    ast = Markdown.parse(md)\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to hold the extracted code\n    extracted_code = \"\"\n\n    # Traverse the AST and find all code blocks\n    for node in ast\n        if typeof(node) == Markdown.Code\n            # Check if the language of the code block is Julia\n            if node.language == \"julia\"\n                # Remove the code fences (```) from the beginning and end\n                code_text = replace(string(node.content), r\"^```|```$\" => \"\")\n                # Join consecutive lines with a newline\n                extracted_code *= \"\\n\" * code_text\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return extracted_code\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nmd = \"\"\"\n# This is an example Markdown document\n\n```julia\nfunction add(a, b)\n    return a + b\nend\n```\n\nMore text...\n\n```julia\nlet x = 10, y = 20\n    println(x + y)\nend\n```\n\"\"\"\n\n# Call the function and print the result\nresult = extract_julia_code(md)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis example assumes that you are using Julia's Markdown package. The `Markdown.parse` function parses the given string into an AST, which is then traversed to find code blocks with the `julia` language specified. The code fences (```) are removed from the beginning and end of each block, and the content is joined together with a newline character.\n\nPlease note that this example assumes that there are no nested code blocks or other complications in the Markdown document. If your Markdown document has more complex structures, you might need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[85,510],"elapsed":39.703111318,"_type":"aimessage"}]
