Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To extract Julia code blocks from a Markdown document in Julia, you can use regular expressions to match the code fence patterns and then join the code blocks together. Here's an example of how you might implement this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regular expression for matching Julia code blocks with fences\n    pattern = r\"^```julia\\n([\\s\\S]*?)^```\"m\n    \n    # Initialize an empty string to hold the extracted code\n    extracted_code = \"\"\n    \n    # Iterate over all matches in the markdown document\n    for match in eachmatch(pattern, md)\n        # Get the content of the code block between the fences\n        content = strip(match.captures[1])\n        \n        # Remove the leading and trailing newlines added by the code fence\n        content = replace(content, r\"^\\n+|\\n+$\" => \"\")\n        \n        # If there's already extracted code, add a newline before appending the new content\n        if !isempty(extracted_code)\n            content = \"\\n\" * content\n        end\n        \n        # Append the content to the extracted code\n        extracted_code *= content\n    end\n    \n    return extracted_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression to match lines starting with ````julia` followed by any number of characters, and ending with another line containing just `````. It then captures the content between these fences. The `m` flag on the pattern makes it multi-line aware, so the regex can match across multiple lines.\n\nThe code removes leading and trailing newlines from each code block to ensure there are no extra blank lines at the beginning or end of the extracted code. It then joins all the code blocks together with a newline in between if there's more than one code block.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the Markdown document only contains Julia code blocks and does not handle any other elements or formatting within the document. It also assumes that there are no nested code blocks, which could be a more complex issue to solve.","status":200,"tokens":[0,476],"elapsed":36.936810256,"_type":"aimessage"}]
