It then iterates over each element of the document and looks for `MD.CodeBlock` elements with a language of \"julia\". If found, it strips leading and trailing whitespace from each line of code, joins them together with a newline, and appends the resulting code block to the `julia_code` string.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes there is at least one Julia code block in the Markdown document and that the language identifier within the fenced code blocks is \"julia\". If you have multiple code blocks with different languages, you would need to adjust the logic accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,435],"elapsed":33.746622757,"_type":"aimessage"}]
