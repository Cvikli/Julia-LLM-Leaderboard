You can then traverse this tree to find all the code blocks and extract the text within them. Here's how you could implement the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Parse the markdown document into an AbstractString tree structure\n    doc = Markdown.parse(md)\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to hold the extracted code\n    extracted_code = \"\"\n\n    # Traverse the tree and extract code blocks\n    for node in doc\n        if isa(node, Markdown.Code) && startswith(node.text, \"```julia\")\n            # Remove the code fences\n            fenced_code = replace(node.text, r\"^```julia\\n|\\n```$\" => \"\")\n            # Join multiple code blocks if present\n            if occursin(\"\\n\\n\", fenced_code)\n                lines = split(fenced_code, \"\\n\\n\"; keepempty=false)\n                extracted_code *= join(lines, \"\\n\") * \"\\n\"\n            else\n                extracted_code *= fenced_code\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return the extracted code as a string\n    return extracted_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. Parses the Markdown document using `Markdown.parse`.\n2. Iterates over the resulting AbstractString tree, looking for nodes that are instances of `Markdown.Code` and have a leading line of \"```julia\" (indicating a Julia code block).\n3. Removes the opening and closing code fences from each code block using `replace` with a regular expression.\n4. If there are multiple code blocks, it splits them by double newlines (`\"\\n\\n\"`) and joins them back together with a single newline character. This is to handle cases where the original document had multiple code blocks separated by empty paragraphs.\n5. Appends each extracted code block to `extracted_code` and returns it as a string.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\n# Assuming 'md' is your Markdown document\nresult = extract_julia_code(md)\nprintln(\"Extracted Julia code:\\n$result\")\n```\n\nRemember to add `using Markdown` at the beginning of your script if you want to use this function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,588],"elapsed":45.783343657,"_type":"aimessage"}]
