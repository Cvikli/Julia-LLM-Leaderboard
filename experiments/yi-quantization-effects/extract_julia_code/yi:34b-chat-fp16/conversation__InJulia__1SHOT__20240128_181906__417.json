Here's how you could implement the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    julia_code = \"\"\n\n    for (i, block) in enumerate(Markdown.parse(md))\n        if isa(block, Markdown.CodeBlock) && block[:language] == \"julia\"\n            # Append the code to the result\n            julia_code *= string(block[:text])\n        elseif isa(block, Array) && length(block) > 0\n            # If we're not in a CodeBlock and have an array of blocks,\n            # recurse into it to handle nested code blocks.\n            julia_code *= extract_julia_code(string(block))\n        end\n    end\n\n    return julia_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function will work by iterating over each block in the Markdown document and looking for `CodeBlock`s with the language set to `\"julia\"`. It will then concatenate all of these code blocks together, ignoring any other types of blocks or nested structures within the Markdown document.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes there is at least one Julia code block in the document and does not handle errors or edge cases (like malformed Markdown). It also does not preserve line breaks within the code blocks, as it simply joins all the code together with newlines between each block.","status":200,"tokens":[0,390],"elapsed":30.23756361,"_type":"aimessage"}]
