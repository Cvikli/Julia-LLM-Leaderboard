Here's an example of how to extract all the code blocks and join them together:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Parse the markdown into an AbstractSyntaxTree\n    ast = parse(md)\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to hold the extracted Julia code\n    extracted_code = \"\"\n\n    # Iterate over all the nodes in the AST\n    for node in ast.children\n        if isa(node, Markdown.Code) && node.lang == \"julia\"\n            # Remove the code fences (```) from the start and end of the code block\n            code_text = replace(string(node.content), r\"^```\\n|\\n```$\" => \"\")\n            # Join all lines in the code block with a newline\n            extracted_code *= \"\\n\" * join(split(code_text, \"\\n\"), \"\\n\")\n        end\n    end\n\n    return extracted_code\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nmd = read(\"example.md\", String) # Replace with your markdown file path\njulia_code = extract_julia_code(md)\nprintln(julia_code)\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `\"example.md\"` with the path to your actual Markdown document. This function assumes that there are no nested code blocks and that each Julia code block is preceded and followed by text or other non-code block elements. If you have a more complex markdown structure, you might need to adjust the logic accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,385],"elapsed":29.851332369,"_type":"aimessage"}]
