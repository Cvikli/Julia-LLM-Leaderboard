[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Here's how you can extract Julia code blocks from a Markdown document in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regular expression to match code fences with language \"julia\"\n    re = r\"^```julia\\n([\\s\\S]*?)^```\\n\"m\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the extracted code blocks\n    output = \"\"\n\n    # Loop through each match of the regular expression\n    while true\n        match = match(re, md)\n        if match === nothing\n            break\n        end\n        # Append the matched code block to the output\n        output *= match[1]\n        # Remove the matched code fence from the Markdown document\n        md = replace(md, match.string => \"\")\n    end\n\n    return output\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression to match ````julia` code fences with any amount of text between them (`[\\s\\S]*?`). The `m` flag makes the regex multiline, so it can match across multiple lines in the Markdown document.\n\nThe `^` and `$` anchors are used to ensure that the entire line is matched (not just a portion). The `*?` makes the match lazy, which is necessary because we don't want to inadvertently include another code fence in our extraction if it starts with ````julia`.\n\nThe function iteratively matches and removes each code block from the Markdown document until there are no more matches. Finally, it returns the concatenated string of all extracted Julia code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[0,360],"elapsed":27.974485237,"_type":"aimessage"}]
