It then iterates over each match, strips any leading and trailing newlines from the captured content (the actual code block), and concatenates them together with a newline character. Finally, it returns the combined string of all extracted Julia code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[0,235],"elapsed":18.202581096,"_type":"aimessage"}]
