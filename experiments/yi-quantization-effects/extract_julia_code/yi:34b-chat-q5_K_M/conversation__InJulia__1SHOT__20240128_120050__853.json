[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can extract the content of Markdown code blocks using regular expressions or by parsing the Markdown document with an appropriate library. However, for this example, I will use a simple regex-based approach to extract the Julia code blocks from the `md` string.\n\nHere's how you could define the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regex pattern for matching code fences with language 'julia'\n    pattern = r\"^```julia\\n([\\s\\S]+?)\\n```$\"m\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the extracted code\n    extracted_code = \"\"\n\n    # Match all occurrences of `pattern` in the Markdown document\n    for match in eachmatch(pattern, md)\n        # Get the captured group, which contains the actual code content\n        code_block = match.captures[1]\n\n        # Remove leading and trailing whitespace from the code block\n        trimmed_code_block = replace(code_block, r\"\\s+\" => \" \")\n\n        # Append the trimmed code block to the extracted code string\n        extracted_code *= \"\\n\" * trimmed_code_block\n    end\n\n    return extracted_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression to match sections of the Markdown document that are enclosed in triple backticks and have `julia` as their language identifier. For each match, it captures the code content inside the first group and then trims leading and trailing whitespace from that capture. Finally, it appends the trimmed code block to a string variable where all the extracted code blocks will be stored.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no nested code blocks within the Julia code blocks. If you have such cases, you would need a more sophisticated parser to handle them correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,421],"elapsed":13.718333901,"_type":"aimessage"}]
