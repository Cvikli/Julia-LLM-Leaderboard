The following function `extract_julia_code` does this task:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regex pattern for code fences with language \"julia\"\n    pattern = r\"^```julia\\n(?<code>.*?)^```\"m\n    # Match all occurrences of the pattern\n    matches = matchall(pattern, md)\n    \n    # Join all matches together\n    code_blocks = join([m.captures[1] for m in matches], \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Remove leading and trailing whitespace from each line\n    clean_code = replace(code_blocks, r\"^\\s+|\\s+$\" => \"\")\n    \n    return clean_code\nend\n```\n\nHere's how you can use the function:\n\n```julia\n# Example Markdown document with Julia code blocks\nmd = raw\"\"\"\nThis is an example markdown document.\n\n```julia\nfunction add(a, b)\n    return a + b\nend\n```\n\nMore text here...\n\n```julia\nadd(2, 3) # This should return 5\n```\n\nEven more text...\n\"\"\"\n\n# Call the function to extract Julia code blocks\njulia_code = extract_julia_code(md)\n\nprintln(julia_code)\n# Output:\n# function add(a, b)\n#     return a + b\n# end\n#\n# add(2, 3) # This should return 5\n```\n\nThis function works by using a regular expression to match code blocks with the ````julia` fence and captures the content between the fences. It then joins all matches together with newlines and removes leading and trailing whitespace from each line to ensure that the extracted code is clean and ready for use in another context.","status":200,"tokens":[0,447],"elapsed":14.568481329,"_type":"aimessage"}]
