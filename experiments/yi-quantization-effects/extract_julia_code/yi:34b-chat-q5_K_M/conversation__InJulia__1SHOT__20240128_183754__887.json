It uses a regular expression to match Julia code blocks, which are defined by three backticks followed by \"julia\" and then another set of three backticks. The regex matches everything inside these fences, including leading and trailing whitespace, which is then cleaned up before being concatenated with the rest of the extracted code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,327],"elapsed":10.634986465,"_type":"aimessage"}]
