[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

It first splits the document into lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`. Then it filters out all lines that start with `\"```julia\"`, which indicates the beginning of a code block in Julia.\n\nFor each code block found, the function starts at the line after the opening code fence (`\"```julia\"`) and finds the next occurrence of `\"```\"` to determine the end of the code block. It then extracts all lines between these two points and joins them into a single string using `join(lines[start_idx:end_idx], \"\\n\")`.\n\nFinally, it joins all the extracted code blocks together with a newline character in between using `join(codes_text, \"\\n\")` to create the final output.","status":200,"tokens":[396,396],"elapsed":13.349260885,"_type":"aimessage"}]
