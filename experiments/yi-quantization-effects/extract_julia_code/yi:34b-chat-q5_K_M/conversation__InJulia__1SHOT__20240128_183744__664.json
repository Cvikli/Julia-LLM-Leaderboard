Here's an example of how you might implement such a function:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Parse the markdown into an AbstractSyntaxTree\n    ast = parse(Markdown.MD, md)\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the extracted code\n    extracted_code = \"\"\n\n    # Iterate over all code blocks in the document\n    for i in 1:length(ast)\n        if isa(ast[i], Markdown.Code) && ast[i].lang == \"julia\"\n            # Append the content of each code block to the extracted code\n            extracted_code *= \"\\n\" * ast[i].content\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Remove leading and trailing whitespace, and convert line breaks to single newlines\n    return replace(extracted_code, r\"^\\s+|\\s+$\" => \"\") * \"\\n\"\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nmd = \"\"\"\n# This is a markdown document with Julia code blocks\n\n```julia\nfunction my_function()\n    println(\"Hello, World!\")\nend\n```\n\n```julia\nmy_function()\n```\n\"\"\"\n\nprint(extract_julia_code(md))\n```\n\nThis function will output:\n\n```julia\nfunction my_function()\n    println(\"Hello, World!\")\nend\n\nmy_function()\n```\n\nIt searches for code blocks with the `julia` language specified and joins them together with a newline. Note that this example assumes there are no other types of code blocks or formatting in the document. If your Markdown document has multiple code blocks with different languages, you would want to update the function to handle those cases appropriately.","status":200,"tokens":[0,447],"elapsed":14.574984705,"_type":"aimessage"}]
