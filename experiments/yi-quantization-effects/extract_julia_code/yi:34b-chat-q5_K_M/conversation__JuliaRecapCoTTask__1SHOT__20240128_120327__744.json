[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

When it encounters a code fence (a pair of lines with `----`), it toggles a flag to indicate whether it's inside a code block or not. If it's not inside a code block, it simply appends the line to the output string. If it is inside a code block, it concatenates the line to the current code block content. Once a code fence is closed (another `----` is encountered), the function checks if there are any empty lines between the current code block and the previous one. If not, it joins them together with a newline character.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the markdown document does not contain any nested code blocks, which would require more sophisticated parsing logic to handle correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,458],"elapsed":15.162720677,"_type":"aimessage"}]
