Here's an example of how you might write the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regular expression for matching code fences in Markdown\n    re_code_fence = r\"^```julia[\\r\\n]?(.*?)```\"m\n\n    # Initialize the output string and match all code fences\n    output = \"\"\n    matches = eachmatch(re_code_fence, md)\n\n    # Loop over matches and append the content inside the code fence to the output\n    for m in matches\n        # Remove the code fence itself from the match\n        julia_code = replace(m.captures[1], r\"^```julia\\n\" => \"\")\n        julia_code = replace(julia_code, r\"\\n```$\" => \"\")\n\n        # Append the code to the output with a newline if there is more than one code block\n        if !isempty(output)\n            output *= \"\\n\"\n        end\n        output *= julia_code\n    end\n\n    return output\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression to match lines that start with ````julia` and ends with `````. It then iterates over all matches, removing the code fences from the captured group (which contains the actual Julia code), and appending each piece of code to the output string with a newline if there are multiple code blocks.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the Markdown document only contains `julia` language code blocks delimited by triple backticks. It does not handle nested code fences or other Markdown elements such as headers, lists, or links. If your Markdown document has more complex structure, you may need a more sophisticated parsing approach.","status":200,"tokens":[0,446],"elapsed":11.795277384,"_type":"aimessage"}]
