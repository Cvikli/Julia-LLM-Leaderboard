It works by splitting the markdown into lines, then checks each line to see if it starts with \"```julia\" or \"``` Julia\" (to account for both possible syntaxes). If it does, we start capturing code. Once we see \"```\" again, we stop capturing. The code is then joined together with newlines in between each line.","status":200,"tokens":[0,413],"elapsed":10.906856979,"_type":"aimessage"}]
