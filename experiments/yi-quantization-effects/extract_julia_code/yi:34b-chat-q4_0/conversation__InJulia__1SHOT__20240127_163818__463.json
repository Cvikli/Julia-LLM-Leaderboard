Here's how you could implement the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Parse the markdown document into an AST\n    ast = parse(md)\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to hold the extracted code\n    output = \"\"\n\n    # Traverse the AST and collect Julia code blocks\n    visit(ast, NodeVisitor(n -> begin\n        if isa(n, CodeBlockNode) && n.lang == \"julia\"\n            # Append the code to the output\n            output *= strip_fences(n.text)\n        end\n    end))\n\n    # Return the extracted code as a string\n    return output\nend\n\nfunction strip_fences(code)\n    # Remove three backticks from the beginning and end of the code block\n    return replace(code, r\"```\" => \"\")\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nmd = read(\"example.md\", String) # Replace with your markdown file path\njulia_code = extract_julia_code(md)\nprintln(julia_code)\n```\n\nIn this example, `extract_julia_code` takes a string containing Markdown content and returns the extracted Julia code as a string. The `strip_fences` function is used to remove the code fences (three backticks) from the beginning and end of each code block before joining them together with a newline.\n\nPlease note that you should replace `\"example.md\"` with the actual path to your Markdown file in the example usage.","status":200,"tokens":[0,424],"elapsed":11.208497411,"_type":"aimessage"}]
