Splitting the markdown document into lines with `split(md, '\\n')`.\n2. Iterating over these lines and checking if each line matches a code fence start using `occursin(language_regex, line)`.\n3. If a line does not match a code fence start but is not empty (since blank lines are usually skipped in code blocks), it is added to the result string with a newline.\n4. The final code fence at the end of the document is removed if present.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no nested code fences and that all code fences start and end with the same language identifier (in this case, \"julia\"). It also assumes that there are no line breaks within a code block that are not represented by a newline character in the source Markdown document.","status":200,"tokens":[0,469],"elapsed":12.449819322,"_type":"aimessage"}]
