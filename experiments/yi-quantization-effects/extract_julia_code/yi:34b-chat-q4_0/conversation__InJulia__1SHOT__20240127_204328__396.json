Here's how you could implement `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regex pattern to match fenced code blocks with language 'julia'\n    language_pattern = r\"^ *```julia\"m\n    content_pattern = r\"^[`]{3}(?<lang>\\w+)[`]?\\n(?<content>.*?)\\n[`]{3}$\"m\n    \n    # Use a stack to keep track of the code blocks and their content\n    code_blocks = Vector{String}()\n    current_block = \"\"\n    in_fenced_code = false\n    \n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if ismatch(language_pattern, line)\n            # Start of a new fenced code block\n            in_fenced_code = true\n            current_block = String[]\n        elseif !in_fenced_code || (isempty(line) && current_block == \"\")\n            # Not in a code block or empty line, do nothing\n        else\n            # Append to the current block\n            push!(current_block, line)\n        end\n        \n        if ismatch(content_pattern, join(current_block, \"\\n\"))\n            # We have a complete code block\n            m = match(content_pattern, join(current_block, \"\\n\"))\n            lang = m[:lang]\n            content = m[:content]\n            \n            if lang == \"julia\"\n                code_blocks += [join(current_block, \"\\n\")]\n            end\n            # Reset the current block for next content\n            current_block = String[]\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Join all code blocks together with a newline\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\") * \"\\n\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each line in the Markdown document and checking if it matches the start of a fenced code block (````julia` pattern) or the content within a code block (`^[`]{3}(?<lang>\\w+)[`]?\\n(?<content>.*?)\\n[`]{3}$` pattern) using regular expressions with `m` flag for multiline matching.\n\nIt maintains a stack to keep track of the current code block content and only adds blocks that have the language `julia` to the result. Finally, it joins all the extracted code blocks together with a newline character.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes the Markdown document is well-formed and does not contain nested code blocks or invalid syntax within the code fences. It also assumes that each ````julia` code fence starts a new block, even if the previous one was empty.","status":200,"tokens":[0,669],"elapsed":17.856525627,"_type":"aimessage"}]
