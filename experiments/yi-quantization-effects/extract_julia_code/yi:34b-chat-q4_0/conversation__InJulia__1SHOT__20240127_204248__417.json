[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Below is an example of how you might implement the `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Replace three backticks with a single newline to remove code fences\n    clean_md = replace(md, r\"^```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```$\"m => s\"\\n\\1\\n\")\n    \n    # Split on newlines to get each code block as a separate string\n    code_blocks = split(clean_md, \"\\n\\n\"; keepempty=false)\n    \n    # Filter out empty strings and join the non-empty ones with newlines\n    joined_code = join(filter(!isempty, code_blocks), \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works as follows:\n\n1. It first replaces each occurrence of ````julia` followed by a newline and then the same amount of lines as were between the opening and closing fences, and finally another newline, with just a single newline character. This effectively removes the code fences without altering the content inside them.\n\n2. The resulting markdown document is split into an array of strings at each instance where two or more consecutive newlines occur, resulting in one element per code block (or paragraph).\n\n3. Any empty elements (which would correspond to blank lines) are filtered out of the array.\n\n4. Finally, the non-empty elements are joined back together with newline characters between them, creating a single string containing all the Julia code blocks from the original markdown document.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that each code block is surrounded by three backticks and that there are no other types of code fences (e.g., for different languages) in the document. If you need to handle multiple language-specific code blocks, you would need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[85,435],"elapsed":11.694959288,"_type":"aimessage"}]
