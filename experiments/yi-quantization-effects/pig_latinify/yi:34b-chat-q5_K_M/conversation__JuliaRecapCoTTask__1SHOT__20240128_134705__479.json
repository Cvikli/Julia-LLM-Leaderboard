[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It checks if a string is empty and skips it, then applies a substitution to move the first letter to the end of the word (appending \"ay\"). Finally, it concatenates the moved letter with \"ay\" to create the pig latin version of the word.\n\n# Solve the Task\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strs::Vector{String})\n    threads = threadid() - 1\n    n_threads = length(strs)\n    @assert n_threads <= Threads.nthreads() \"Number of strings exceeds available threads\"\n    \n    # Distribute work across threads\n    thread_chunks = Vector{Vector{String}}(undef, n_threads)\n    for i in 1:n_threads\n        start_index = (i-1) * length(strs) / n_threads\n        end_index = start_index + length(strs) / n_threads - 1\n        thread_chunks[i] = strs[(start_index):(end_index)]\n    end\n    \n    # Parallelize the processing\n    @threads for i in eachindex(thread_chunks)\n        pig_latinify!(thread_chunks[i])\n    end\n    \n    # Combine results back into a single vector\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(strs))\n    for i in 1:length(strs)\n        result[i] = strs[i]\n    end\n    return result\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify!(strs::Vector{String})\n    for s in strs\n        if isempty(s)\n            continue\n        end\n        first_letter = first(s)\n        rest_of_word = replace(sub(s, r\"^([a-zA-Z])\", s\"\\1ay\"), \" \" => \"\")\n        s[1:length(s)] = rest_of_word * first_letter * \"ay\"\n    end\n    return strs\nend\n```\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function now has two parts: the initialization of thread-specific chunks and the actual parallel processing. The `pig_latinify!` function is a modified version of the original to work on a subset of strings rather than individual ones.\n\n# Double-check that the Solution is Correct\n\n```julia\nusing Test\n\n@testset \"Pig Latin Transformer\" begin\n    strs = [\"Hello\", \"World\", \"!\"]\n    expected_result = [\"Helloay\", \"Worlday\", \"!ay\"]\n    actual_result = pig_latinify(strs)\n    @test actual_result == expected_result\nend\n```\n\nThe test suite ensures that the `pig_latinify` function works as expected on a simple example.","status":200,"tokens":[0,836],"elapsed":27.743270735,"_type":"aimessage"}]
