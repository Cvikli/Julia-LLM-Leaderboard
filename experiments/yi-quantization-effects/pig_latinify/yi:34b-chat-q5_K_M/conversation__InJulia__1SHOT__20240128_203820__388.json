Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can use the `@threads` macro to run a block of code on multiple threads. Here's an example of how you could implement the `pig_latinify` function that operates on a vector of strings:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(texts)\n    num_threads = Threads.nthreads()\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(texts))\n    @assert num_threads > 1 \"This function requires at least two threads to work correctly\"\n\n    @threads for (i, text) in enumerate(texts)\n        result[i] = pig_latinify_single(text)\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_single(text::String)\n    # Here's a simple implementation of Pig Latin translation:\n    first_vowel_pos = findfirst(c -> c in 'aeiouy', text[1:])\n    if first_vowel_pos === nothing\n        return text * \"way\"\n    else\n        prefix = text[1:(first_vowel_pos - 1)]\n        suffix = text[(first_vowel_pos):]\n        return suffix * prefix * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis code defines two functions: `pig_latinify`, which is the main function that you will call with a vector of strings; and `pig_latinify_single`, which does the actual translation for one string. The `@threads` macro in the `pig_latinify` function tells Julia to run the loop over each element of the vector using multiple threads.\n\nPlease note that the `@threads` macro should be used with caution, as it may lead to race conditions if the code inside the loop is not thread-safe. In this case, we're just calling a function that doesn't modify any global state or shared mutable data, so it's safe to run in parallel.\n\nTo use the `pig_latinify` function, you simply need to pass a vector of strings:\n\n```julia\ntexts = [\"Hello world!\", \"This is a test.\", \"Pig latin is fun.\"]\ntranslated_texts = pig_latinify(texts)\n```\n\nThe `translated_texts` vector will contain the Pig Latin translations of each string in `texts`.","status":200,"tokens":[66,554],"elapsed":18.264780091,"_type":"aimessage"}]
