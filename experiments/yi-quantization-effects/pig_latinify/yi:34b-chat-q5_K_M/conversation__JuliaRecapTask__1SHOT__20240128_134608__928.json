[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The transformation is done in parallel using multiple threads, with each thread processing a chunk of the original vector.\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function first determines the number of threads to use (`n_threads`) and then splits the input vector into equally-sized chunks. Each chunk is processed by a separate thread, and the results are collected and combined into a single vector once all threads have finished their work.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_chunk` function actually performs the transformation for each chunk. It handles the details of transforming the words into Pig Latin based on whether the first character is a vowel sound or not, as well as handling \"qu\" combinations.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you are using a Julia version that supports `@async` and `wait()` in the way shown. This feature was added in Julia 1.3. If you are using an older version of Julia, you may need to use a different approach for managing threads.","status":200,"tokens":[0,752],"elapsed":24.923143003,"_type":"aimessage"}]
