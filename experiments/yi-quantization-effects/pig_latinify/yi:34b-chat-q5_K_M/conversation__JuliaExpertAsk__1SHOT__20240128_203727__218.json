The `isascii`, `isalpha`, `islower`, and `isspace` functions are used to check if a character is ASCII, alphabetic, lowercase, or a space, respectively. The `isuppercase` function is used to check if a character is uppercase.\n\nThe pig latin rules are applied depending on whether the first letter is:\n\n1. A consonant (moved to the end and \"ay\" is added).\n2. A vowel (\"way\" is added to the end).\n3. Non-alphabetic or uppercase (handled separately by adding \"way\" at the end).\n4. Followed by a space or hyphen (\"way\" is added).\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes that each word can be processed independently and that there are no unicode characters in the input strings, which would require more sophisticated handling.","status":200,"tokens":[96,522],"elapsed":17.235033011,"_type":"aimessage"}]
