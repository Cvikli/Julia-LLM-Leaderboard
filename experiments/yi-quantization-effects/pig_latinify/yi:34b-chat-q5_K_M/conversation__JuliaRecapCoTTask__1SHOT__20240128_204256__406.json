[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `@spawn` macro asynchronously starts a new task on a free thread, and `Threads.wait` waits for all spawned tasks to complete. This allows us to run each string transformation on a separate thread while keeping the main thread unblocked.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_thread` function is called within a thread using `@spawn` and is responsible for converting a single word to pig latin. It writes the result back to an output vector that is passed as an argument. The `out` vector must have exactly one element, which will hold the transformed string after the thread finishes execution.\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function initializes the `results` vector with `undef` to indicate that it can be initialized by the threads, and then launches each transformation task using `@spawn`. Finally, it waits for all tasks to complete using `Threads.wait` and returns the results vector.\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function also checks if there are any strings in the input vector and informs the user about how many threads will be used for processing.","status":200,"tokens":[0,563],"elapsed":18.64988519,"_type":"aimessage"}]
