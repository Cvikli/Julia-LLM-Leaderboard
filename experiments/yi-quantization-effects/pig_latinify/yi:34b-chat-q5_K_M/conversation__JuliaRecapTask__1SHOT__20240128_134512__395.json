[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It accounts for words starting with vowels and handles empty strings gracefully. The `pig_latinify` function uses the `@threads` macro from the `Base.Threads` module to parallelize the transformation over a vector of strings.\n\nPlease note that `@threads` is used here in an unblocking manner, meaning that each thread will process one element of the vector independently and without blocking other threads. This assumes that the processing time for each word is relatively small compared to the overhead of thread creation and synchronization.\n\nThe example usage at the end demonstrates how to apply `pig_latinify` to a vector of strings.","status":200,"tokens":[377,412],"elapsed":13.835108743,"_type":"aimessage"}]
