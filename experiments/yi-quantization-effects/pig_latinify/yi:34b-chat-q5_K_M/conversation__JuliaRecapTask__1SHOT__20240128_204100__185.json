[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

This is the standard way of translating to pig latin.\n- Non-letter characters at the beginning of the word are ignored since they don't follow the same pattern in pig latin.\n- The `length_per_thread` variable ensures that we have at least one word per thread and adjusts the number of threads based on the length of the input vector. This is to avoid race conditions where multiple threads might try to access the same element of `words` or `piglatin_words` simultaneously.\n- The `@assert` statement is used to check that the number of words is a multiple of the chunk size to ensure correct threading behavior. If this condition is not met, an assertion error will be raised, informing the user that the input must be divisible by the chunk size for proper threading.\n\nPlease note that using threads can introduce complexity and potential issues, such as race conditions or deadlocks if the code is not properly synchronized. In this example, we've tried to minimize these risks by ensuring each word is processed independently and by using the `@threads` macro which provides some level of implicit synchronization. However, users should be aware that parallel processing can sometimes lead to subtle bugs that are not present in a serial implementation.","status":200,"tokens":[0,876],"elapsed":29.107328372,"_type":"aimessage"}]
