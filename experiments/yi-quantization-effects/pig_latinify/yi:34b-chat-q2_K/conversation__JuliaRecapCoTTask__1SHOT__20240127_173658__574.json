[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `nthreads()` function from the `Threads` module is used to determine the number of threads available for processing. The actual conversion to Pig Latin is done within an asynchronous block, ensuring that each word translation happens in its own thread.\n\nThe `convert_to_pig_latin` function breaks a string into words and then applies the conversion logic to each word. Non-alphanumeric characters are preserved as they are. If a word starts with a vowel or space, \"ay\" is appended to the end; otherwise, \"ay\" is prepended to the word followed by any subsequent non-alpha characters.\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes an English-style Pig Latin conversion where words are translated into single-syllable representations without regard for actual phonetic pronunciation or foreign words.","status":200,"tokens":[0,548],"elapsed":14.329633964,"_type":"aimessage"}]
