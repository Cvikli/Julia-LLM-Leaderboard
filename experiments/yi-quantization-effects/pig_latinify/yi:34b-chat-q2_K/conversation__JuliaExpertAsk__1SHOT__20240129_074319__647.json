It uses the `@threads` macro to parallelize the computation over the vector elements, with each element being processed on a separate thread. The `remotecall` function is used to invoke the `pig_latinify` function on each thread, and `wait` is used to wait for all futures to complete before combining their results. Finally, the results are joined back into a single vector of strings using `vcat` and `join`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,436],"elapsed":11.621343714,"_type":"aimessage"}]
