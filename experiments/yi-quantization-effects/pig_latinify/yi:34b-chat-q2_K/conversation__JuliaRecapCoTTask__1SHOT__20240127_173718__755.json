[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

If you're running this on an older version of Julia that does not have `Threads.@spawn`, you can use `pmap` instead or write your own threaded implementation.\n- The `pig_latinify_inner` function handles the actual transformation logic and is called by `pig_latinify` for each element of `texts`.\n- If a word consists solely of whitespace characters, it is considered an empty string for the purposes of pig latin translation.\n- The function `first(word)` returns the first rune of a string as a `Rune` type (Julia's equivalent of `Char`), which is necessary to handle Unicode properly. The `isspace` function checks if a character is whitespace.\n- The `join` function at the end joins the resulting array of words back into a single string with spaces between them.\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes you are using Julia 1.7 or later, as earlier versions do not have the `Threads.@spawn` macro.","status":200,"tokens":[0,735],"elapsed":19.249646594,"_type":"aimessage"}]
