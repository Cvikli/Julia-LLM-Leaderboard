[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It then distributes the work across multiple threads or processes the strings in sequence if no threading is requested (by default). The actual conversion from English to Pig Latin is done within the `process_string` function, which simply appends 'ay' to each word and concatenates consecutive characters that are not vowels nor part of a number or symbol.\n\nThe `pigeon_latinify` function handles thread creation based on the provided `nthreads` parameter, while the `process_string` function performs the actual transformation logic. The `process_string` function is designed to be reentrant and safe for use within multiple threads without any additional synchronization or locking mechanisms.","status":200,"tokens":[0,602],"elapsed":16.34925063,"_type":"aimessage"}]
