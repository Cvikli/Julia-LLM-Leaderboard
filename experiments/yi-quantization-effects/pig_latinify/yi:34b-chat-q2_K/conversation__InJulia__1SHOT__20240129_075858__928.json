Below is an example implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads; using Vectorization\nimport Base: +, -, *, /, <, <=, ==, !=, >, >=, promote_op, promote_all\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String}; nthreads=Threads.nthreads())\n    @assert length(strings) % nthreads == 0 \"The number of strings must be divisible by the number of threads\"\n    chunks = Vector{Future}(undef, nthreads)\n    for i in 1:nthreads()\n        chunk_start = (i-1) * length(strings) // nthreads + 1\n        chunk_end = min(chunk_start + length(strings) // nthreads, length(strings))\n        chunks[i] = @spawnat i pig_latinify_chunk(strings, chunk_start:chunk_end)\n    end\n    wait.(chunks)\n    return vcat(chunks[1].result::Vector{String}...)\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_chunk(strings::Vector{String}, start::Int, end::Int)\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(strings))\n    for (i, s) in enumerate(strings[start:end])\n        if i == 1\n            # First word of a chunk is followed by an empty string.\n            # This prevents race conditions when concatenating the strings later.\n            results[1] = \"\"\n            words = split(s, r\" +\")\n        else\n            words = String[]\n            for w in split(s, r\" +\")\n                if startswith(w, lowercase(w)) == false\n                    push!(words, lstrip(String, w))\n                end\n            end\n        end\n        @assert length(words) == length(strings[start:end]) \"Splitting a chunk failed\"\n        for (i, w) in enumerate(words)\n            results[start + i - 1] = w * \" \" * join(words[i+1:end], \" \")\n        end\n    end\n    return results\nend\n```\n\nThis function will operate on a vector of strings with each thread handling a chunk of the input. The first word of each chunk is prepended with a space to prevent race conditions when concatenating the strings later. The `pig_latinify` function then spawns `nthreads()` number of tasks, one for each thread, and waits for them to finish before returning the result as a vector of strings.\n\nPlease note that this code uses both `ThreadingUtilities` (implicitly through `@spawnat`) and `Vectorization` due to their interdependence in Julia's standard library.","status":200,"tokens":[0,678],"elapsed":18.195778423,"_type":"aimessage"}]
