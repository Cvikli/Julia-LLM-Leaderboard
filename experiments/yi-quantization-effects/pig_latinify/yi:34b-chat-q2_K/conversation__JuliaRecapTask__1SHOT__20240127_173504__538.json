[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function is defined to operate on a vector of strings.\n2. It uses `@async` and `Future` to run each word conversion in parallel.\n3. Within the asynchronous block, it splits the text into words using `split`, applies `pig_latinify` to each word, and then joins them back together with spaces.\n4. The recursive function `rest` is used to handle the case where the first part of the string (first letter not a vowel) needs to be concatenated with the rest of the string.\n5. The `pig_latinify` function itself handles the conversion of each word. If the first character is not a vowel, it appends \"ay\" to the result; otherwise, it simply returns the original word.\n\nTo test the function:\n\n```julia\nusing Test\n\ntexts = [\"Hello World\"]\nexpected_result = [\"hello world\"]  # Note the lowercase 'h' and space between \"Hello\" and \"World\" in pig latin\n@test pig_latinify(texts) == expected_result\n```\n\nDouble-checking the solution:\n\n- The code should compile without errors.\n- Running the test should return `true`, indicating that the solution is correct.","status":200,"tokens":[377,599],"elapsed":15.873024218,"_type":"aimessage"}]
