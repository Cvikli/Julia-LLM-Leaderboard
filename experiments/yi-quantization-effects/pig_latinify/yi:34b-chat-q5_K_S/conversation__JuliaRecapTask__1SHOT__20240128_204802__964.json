[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

This is achieved by using the `@threads` macro provided by Julia's Base library.\n- Inside the loop, we check for special cases where words start with \"qu\" or are articles (\"a\", \"an\", \"the\") and handle them differently from other words.\n- For words ending in 'e', we remove the 'e' and add 'ay' to the end.\n- For all other words, we move the first letter to the end and append 'ay'.\n- The `Vector{String}(undef, length(words))` at the beginning creates an undefined (uninitialized) vector of strings with the same length as the input vector, which is then filled in by the loop.\n\nDouble-checking:\n- The code is written to be performant and leverages Julia's multi-threading capabilities through `@threads`.\n- It handles various types of words according to the rules of Pig Latin translation.\n- Since there are no special instructions, we have followed the general guidelines provided for solving problems in the Julia language.","status":200,"tokens":[0,493],"elapsed":15.921509507,"_type":"aimessage"}]
