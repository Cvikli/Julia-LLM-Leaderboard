[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It checks if the first letter of the string is a vowel (excluding 'y' as a vowel) and applies the appropriate rule for transforming it into pig latin. If not, it splits the string around the first character and concatenates the parts with \"ay\" to form the pig latin translation. The `eachindex` iterator is used to ensure that each thread works on a different element of the vector.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the strings are ASCII or Unicode text, and it does not handle punctuation or multi-byte characters. It also does not perform any error checking for empty strings or very short strings where the pig latin translation might be nonsensical (e.g., \"at\" becoming \"tay\").","status":200,"tokens":[0,455],"elapsed":14.688893572,"_type":"aimessage"}]
