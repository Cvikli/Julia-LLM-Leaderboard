It uses the built-in Julia macro `@threads` to parallelize the transformation of each word in the vector across multiple threads. The `pig_latinify` function itself is recursive and handles the transformation of individual words into their pig latin equivalents.","status":200,"tokens":[96,297],"elapsed":9.591003397,"_type":"aimessage"}]
