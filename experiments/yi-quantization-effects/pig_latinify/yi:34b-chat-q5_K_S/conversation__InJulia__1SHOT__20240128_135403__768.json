Here's an example implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(texts::Vector{String})\n    nthreads = nworkers()\n    tasks = Vector{Future}(undef, length(texts))\n    for (i, text) in enumerate(texts)\n        tasks[i] = @spawn pig_latinify_thread(text)\n    end\n    return fetch.(tasks)\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_thread(text::String)\n    # Pig Latin rules:\n    #   1. Add \"hay\" (or \"way\") after the first consonant if there is one.\n    #   2. Move all consonants and the following vowel to the end of the word, preceded by \"ay\".\n    #      If a word starts with a vowel, add \"way\" at the end.\n    output = \"\"\n    for word in split(text)\n        if is_consonant_at_start(word[1])  # Check if the first character is a consonant\n            new_first_letter = 'a'\n            output *= new_first_letter + \"y\"\n            word = word[2:end] * output\n        elseif is_vowel(word[1])  # If the word starts with a vowel, add \"way\" to the end\n            output *= \"ay\"\n            word = word * output\n        end\n        for consonant in findall(is_consonant, word)  # Move all consonants and following vowels to the end\n            new_first_letter = word[1]\n            word = replace(word, first(consonant):last(consonant) => \"\") * new_first_letter\n            output *= \"ay\"\n        end\n        output *= word\n    end\n    return output\nend\n\nfunction is_vowel(c::Char)\n    return c in 'a' : 'z' ? c == 'a' || c == 'e' || c == 'i' || c == 'o' || c == 'u' : false\nend\n\nfunction is_consonant(c::Char)\n    return !is_vowel(c) && (c in 'A' : 'Z' || c in 'a' : 'z')\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ntexts = [\"Hello World!\", \"This is a test.\"]\nresult = pig_latinify(texts)\nprintln(result)  # Expected output: [\"Haylo Woldway!\", \"Thishay isay atestay.\"]\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n1. The `pig_latinify` function creates a vector of futures where each future represents the result of transforming one string in the `texts` vector using `pig_latinify_thread` on a separate thread.\n\n2. The `pig_latinify_thread` function is where the actual work is done. It follows the rules you've outlined to transform each word into Pig Latin.\n\n3. The `is_vowel` and `is_consonant` functions are helper functions used within `pig_latinify_thread` to determine if a character is a vowel or consonant.\n\n4. The `findall` function is used to find all occurrences of consonants in a word, which are then moved to the end with the \"ay\" suffix added.\n\n5. The `replace` function is used to replace the found consonant range with an empty string, effectively moving it to the end of the word.\n\n6. Finally, all the words are concatenated back together to form the Pig Latin version of the original text.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you're running on a Julia version that supports the `Threads` module (Julia 1.5 or higher) and that your system has multiple processors for parallel processing to take place.","status":200,"tokens":[0,958],"elapsed":30.780560679,"_type":"aimessage"}]
