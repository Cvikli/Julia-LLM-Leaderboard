It calls a private helper function `_pig_latinify` to perform the actual transformation, which finds the first vowel (excluding 'y' as a vowel here) and moves all the characters up to that point to the end of the word, suffixed by \"ay\". If no vowels are found, it appends \"way\" to the original string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,316],"elapsed":10.029849662,"_type":"aimessage"}]
