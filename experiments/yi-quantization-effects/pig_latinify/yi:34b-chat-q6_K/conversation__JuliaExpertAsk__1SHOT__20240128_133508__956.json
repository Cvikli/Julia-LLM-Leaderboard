It defines a dictionary of vowels and then checks if the first character of each string is a vowel. If it is, the entire string is appended with \"way\". If not, it finds the index of the first vowel using `findfirst` and moves everything before that to the end of the string, adding \"hay\". If no vowels are found, it adds \"yay\" to the end. Finally, it updates each string in place with the pig latinified version.","status":200,"tokens":[0,442],"elapsed":16.437213537,"_type":"aimessage"}]
