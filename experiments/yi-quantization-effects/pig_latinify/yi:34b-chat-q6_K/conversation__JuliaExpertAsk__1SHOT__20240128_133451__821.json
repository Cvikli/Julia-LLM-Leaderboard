Within each thread, it processes a single string by converting it to Pig Latin. The conversion follows these rules:\n\n1. If the first letter of the word is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), add \"way\" to the end of the word.\n2. If the first letter is not a vowel, move all the letters up to the first vowel to the end of the word and add \"ay\".\n\nThe `strip` function at the end removes any leading or trailing whitespace from each string in the vector.","status":200,"tokens":[0,360],"elapsed":13.363777524,"_type":"aimessage"}]
