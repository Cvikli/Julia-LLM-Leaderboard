The `pig_latinify_thread` function is a worker function that performs the actual translation of one string into Pig Latin. It's important to note that this code uses experimental features of Julia and may not be compatible with older versions.","status":200,"tokens":[0,307],"elapsed":11.384004905,"_type":"aimessage"}]
