[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The transformation is done by moving the first consonant (or the entire word if it starts with a vowel or \"qu\") to the end, followed by \"ay\". Special cases such as \"sh\" and \"qu\" are handled by replacing them with specific sequences before performing the main transformation.\n\nThe function `pig_latinify` works by splitting the input vector into chunks of 500 strings each (or fewer if the last chunk is smaller). Each chunk is processed by a separate thread using `Threads.@threads` to parallelize the work. The `pig_latinify!` function itself is not threaded since it operates on a single string and does not benefit from parallelization within a single task.\n\nThe helper functions `is_vowel` and `is_consonant` are used inside the `pig_latinify!` function to determine whether a character is a vowel or a consonant based on a predefined set of vowels.\n\nFinally, the code tests the function by providing an example vector of words and prints out their Pig Latin versions after processing.","status":200,"tokens":[0,932],"elapsed":35.221419999,"_type":"aimessage"}]
