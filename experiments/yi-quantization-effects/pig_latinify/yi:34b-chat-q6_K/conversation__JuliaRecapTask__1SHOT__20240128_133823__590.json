[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

If no vowel is found, an empty string is appended to the front of the word. The word is then translated to pig latin by adding \"ay\" to the end if there was a vowel found or just returning the original word if not.\n\nThe `@inbounds` macro is used to ensure that bounds checking is disabled for the loop, which can improve performance when iterating over arrays with known indices.\n\nSince each iteration operates on a separate thread, it's important to ensure that the function is safe to call from multiple threads. In this case, we are only modifying local variables within the `@inbounds` loop, so there are no data races or other issues that would require synchronization primitives like locks.","status":200,"tokens":[0,460],"elapsed":17.312024862,"_type":"aimessage"}]
