[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The basic rule for translating a word into pig latin is to:\n\n1. Move the first letter of the word to the end of the word and append \"ay\".\n2. If the first letter is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), add \"way\" to the end instead.\n3. If the word starts with a silent \"e\" or an \"h\" after a vowel, the \"h\" and the preceding vowel are treated as part of the next syllable.\n4. For words that start with a consonant blend (two or more consonants without a vowel between them), only the first consonant is moved to the end. The rest remain in their original positions.\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify_helper(word)\n    # Check if word starts with a vowel\n    if startswith(word, \"aeiou\") || (length(word) > 1 && startswith(word, 'h') && isuppercase(word[2]))\n        return word * \"way\"\n    end\n    \n    # Otherwise, move the first letter to the end and add \"ay\"\n    first_letter = first(word)\n    rest_of_word = word[2:end]\n    return rest_of_word * first_letter * \"ay\"\nend\n```\n\n# Double-check that the Solution is Correct\n\nWe can write a simple test to ensure that our `pig_latinify` function works as expected. Here's an example of how to do this using Julia's `Test` package:\n\n```julia\nusing Test\n\n@testset \"Pig Latin Transformation\" begin\n    # Define some test words and their pig latin equivalents\n    words_and_translations = [(\"Hello\", \"elloHay\"), (\"Banana\", \"ananaBay\")]\n    \n    for (word, expected_translation) in words_and_translations\n        # Test each word and its translation\n        @test pig_latinify(collect([word]))[1] == expected_translation\n    end\nend\n```\n\nBy running this test suite, we can ensure that our `pig_latinify` function correctly transforms words into their pig latin equivalents.","status":200,"tokens":[0,747],"elapsed":28.154866919,"_type":"aimessage"}]
