[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

If not, we split the word into its first letter and the rest and concatenate them in the correct order with \"ay\" at the end.\n- We return the vector of translated words.\n- In the example usage, we use `@threads` to loop over each word in parallel using a separate thread. The `@threads` macro makes the `for` loop iterate in parallel over all the elements of the `strs` vector.\n\nPlease note that the `@threads` macro is used here for demonstration purposes only. In practice, you should be aware of the overhead and potential issues with data races when using it. For small tasks like this, it might not provide a significant performance benefit, and careful synchronization would be required to ensure safe threaded execution.\n\nAlso, remember that `@threads` does not work with ranges (like `i:length(strs)`), so we need to manually loop over the collection.","status":200,"tokens":[377,595],"elapsed":22.645440093,"_type":"aimessage"}]
