[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `@threads` macro is a convenient way to run a for loop across multiple threads. It automatically handles the distribution of iterations among available threads and ensures that changes to shared variables are visible to all threads.\n\nThe function first checks if the text starts with \"qu\" and if so, it moves those two characters to the end followed by \"ay\". For other vowel-initial words, the vowel and the following consonant (if any) are moved to the end, and an \"ay\" is appended. For all other words, only the first letter is moved to the end with \"ay\" added.\n\nPlease note that this implementation does not use non-blocking operations for thread synchronization. If performance is critical and you need to avoid blocking operations, you might want to consider using more advanced techniques like `fetch` and `put!` from the `Future`s package or other mechanisms for managing shared state across threads.\n\nBefore using this function in a production environment, make sure to test it thoroughly, as pig latin rules can be complex and there may be edge cases not covered by this simple implementation. Also, ensure that you have a proper way to handle errors if any occur within the threads, as uncaught exceptions can lead to undefined behavior.","status":200,"tokens":[0,554],"elapsed":20.870728078,"_type":"aimessage"}]
