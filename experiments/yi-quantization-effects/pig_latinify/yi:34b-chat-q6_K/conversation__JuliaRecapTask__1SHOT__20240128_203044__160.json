[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It then uses `@threads` macro to parallelize the transformation over each chunk, ensuring that each thread works on a separate portion of the input vector. The `@threads` macro also handles the case where there is an odd number of words by adjusting the chunk size to include all words in the last chunk.\n\nThe pig latin translation itself is a simple operation that appends \"ay\" to the end of the word, shifted one position to the right, and preceded by any non-space characters from the original string. The `strip` function removes leading and trailing whitespace, which is necessary to ensure that words starting with a space are handled correctly (e.g., \"a b c\" becomes \"ayb c\").\n\nFinally, all the partial results are collected into a single vector of strings after the threads have finished their work.","status":200,"tokens":[0,515],"elapsed":19.3869583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
