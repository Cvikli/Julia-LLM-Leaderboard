It creates a new thread for each string and asynchronously calls the `convert_to_pig_latin` function to perform the transformation. The `wait(threadpool)` call waits for all threads to finish before returning the vector of transformed strings.\n\nThe `convert_to_pig_latin` function is not implemented here because pig latin conversion itself doesn't naturally parallelize, as it requires processing the entire string. However, you could theoretically break up the string into chunks and process those in parallel, but this would require more complex logic to handle edge cases and ensure proper output formatting.\n\nPlease note that the `ThreadPool` API is part of Julia 1.8 and later. For earlier versions, you may need to use other thread-pool implementations or adapt the code to use `@async` with `Channel`s for communication between threads.","status":200,"tokens":[96,375],"elapsed":14.096117593,"_type":"aimessage"}]
