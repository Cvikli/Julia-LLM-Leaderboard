It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Approach\n\n1. Create a function `pig_latinize` that takes a string as input and returns the pig latin translation of the word.\n2. Implement the pig latin translation logic within the function.\n3. Create a vector processing function `process_vector` that applies `pig_latinize` to each element of a vector in parallel using threads.\n4. Test the functions with provided and generated examples.\n\n# Code\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinize(word)\n    # Translation logic: Move the first letter to the end, add \"ay\", and insert an extra space if the word starts with a vowel.\n    first_letter = String(word[1])\n    if isalpha(first_letter) && isspace(word[2]) == false\n        return string(SubString(word, 2), ' ', first_letter, \"ay\")\n    else\n        return string(first_letter, \"ay\")\n    end\nend\n\nfunction process_vector(words)\n    # Initialize an output vector of the same length as the input vector.\n    out_vec = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n\n    # Launch a thread for each word in the vector and write its translation to the corresponding position in the out_vec.\n    Threads.@threads for (i, word) in enumerate(words)\n        out_vec[i] = pig_latinize(word)\n    end\n\n    return out_vec\nend\n\n# Test with provided examples\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]) # This should return [\"ellohay\", \"ppleay\", \"tronghay\", \"orldway\"]\n```\n\n# Solution Checking\n\nTo check the solution, we can run the `pig_latinify` function with the provided example and ensure that the returned vector contains the expected translations. The function should also work correctly with other examples, such as words that start with a vowel or are already in pig latin.","status":200,"tokens":[197,471],"elapsed":25.672454279,"_type":"aimessage"}]
