[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It divides the string into chunks based on the number of threads available and then uses thread synchronization to ensure that all the processing is done without race conditions. The actual transformation from English to Pig Latin is done in the `pig_latinify_single` function, which takes a single string and applies the rules to convert it to Pig Latin.\n\nThe `@sync` macro ensures that all threads wait for each other to finish before proceeding. This is necessary because we are modifying the same vector `strs` from different threads, and without synchronization, we would have race conditions. The `@async` macro allows us to run the transformation on each chunk asynchronously within a thread.\n\nThe `isequal(' ')` function is used to find the space character in the string. The `findnext` function returns the position of the first occurrence of a substring if it exists, or `0` if not found. Since we are looking for the space character, which is usually at the end of the string (unless there's another space within the string), we use `- 1` to exclude the space itself from the first syllable.\n\nThe `strip` function removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string. The `sub` function returns a substring from the original string by replacing the first occurrence of a pattern with an empty string.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes there is at least one word per line in the strings, as it looks for spaces to determine where to apply the Pig Latin rules. If some strings contain no spaces, the result will be incorrect.","status":200,"tokens":[0,682],"elapsed":25.707730523,"_type":"aimessage"}]
