The `make_workers` function is a simple helper function that creates a vector of threads, one for each word to be translated. The `translate_to_pig_latin` function handles the actual translation logic based on the rules provided.","status":200,"tokens":[0,255],"elapsed":9.481082823,"_type":"aimessage"}]
