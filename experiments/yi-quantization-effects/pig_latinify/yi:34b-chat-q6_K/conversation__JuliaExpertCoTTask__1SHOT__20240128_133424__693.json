[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It assumes that you are using a Julia version that supports these features. If you are working with an older version, you may need to use other threading mechanisms or translate the function into a parallel task using the `Base.Threads` module.","status":200,"tokens":[0,415],"elapsed":15.486552298,"_type":"aimessage"}]
