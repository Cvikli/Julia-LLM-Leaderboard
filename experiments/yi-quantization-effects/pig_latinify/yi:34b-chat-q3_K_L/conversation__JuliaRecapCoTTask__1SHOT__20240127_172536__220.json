[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses `@threads` macro to parallelize the transformation over multiple threads, with one thread assigned to each element in the vector. The `pig_latinify_string` function itself is not parallelized as it does not have any obvious points where work can be divided among threads without complicating the logic. Instead, the parallelization is applied at the level of the vector operation.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_string` function first checks if the first letter is a vowel or the second letter in a sequence like \"he\" or \"she\" where the vowel comes after an initial consonant blend. If so, it adds \"way\" to the end of the word. Otherwise, it moves the first letter to the end and adds \"ay\". It then checks if there are any more vowels in the remaining part of the string and continues applying the rule until it reaches the end or finds another vowel-initial substring that needs to be moved and \"ayed\".\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you are using a recent enough version of Julia that has the `@threads` macro available (since 1.3). If you are using an older version, you may need to adapt the threading approach accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,669],"elapsed":18.780643453,"_type":"aimessage"}]
