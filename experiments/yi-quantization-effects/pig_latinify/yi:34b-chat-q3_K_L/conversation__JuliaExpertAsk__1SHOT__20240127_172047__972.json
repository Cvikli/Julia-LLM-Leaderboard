It then uses a parallel for loop (`@threadfor`) to operate on each chunk in a separate thread. The first iteration is slightly different from the rest, as it doesn't have a preceding word to consider. Within the loop, the pig latin transformation is applied to each string, and the result is appended to a running `pig_latin_string`. Finally, the completed strings are collected into a new vector and returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,357],"elapsed":9.847914971,"_type":"aimessage"}]
