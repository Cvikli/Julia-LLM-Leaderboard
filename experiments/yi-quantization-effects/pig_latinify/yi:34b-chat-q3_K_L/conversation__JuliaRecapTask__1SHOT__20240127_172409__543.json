X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

We define a function `pig_latinify` that takes a vector of strings as input and returns a vector of the same length containing the pig latin transformation of each word.\n2. We use `Threads.nthreads()` to get the number of threads available, which we'll use to divide the work among threads.\n3. Inside the function, we create an output vector of the same size as the input vector with undefined values.\n4. We use a loop to iterate over each word in the text, and within this loop, we check if the current index is a multiple of `nthreads`. If so, we spawn a new thread to process that word using `Threads.@spawn`. Otherwise, we process the word on the current thread.\n5. We define an inner function `pig_latinify_word` that takes a single word and transforms it into pig latin. This function is used within both the main loop and the threads spawned from it.\n6. Inside `pig_latinify_word`, we have a series of nested if-else statements to transform each letter based on its type (vowel, consonant, or syllable ending). We use dictionaries to map characters to their types for easy lookups.\n7. We also define a helper function `move_consonant_cluster` that moves the first consonant cluster at the beginning of the word to the end, which is a common step in pig latin transformations.\n\n#### Double-check that the solution is correct\n\n1. The `pig_latinify` function should take a vector of strings and return a vector of the same length containing the pig latin transformation of each word.\n2. Each iteration of the loop within `pig_latinify` should run on a separate thread if the current index is a multiple of `nthreads`.\n3. The `pig_latinify_word` function should correctly transform a single string into its pig latin equivalent by following the rules outlined in the problem description and using the helper functions provided.\n4. The `move_consonant_cluster` function should move the first consonant cluster to the end of the word as described in the instructions.\n5. The solution should be tested with a variety of input strings to ensure that it correctly handles different cases such as words starting with vowels, consonants, and consonant clusters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,1511],"elapsed":42.761701717,"_type":"aimessage"}]
