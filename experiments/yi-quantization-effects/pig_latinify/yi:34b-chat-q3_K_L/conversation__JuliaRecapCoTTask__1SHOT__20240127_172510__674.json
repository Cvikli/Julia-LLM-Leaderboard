[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses multiple threads to parallelize the transformation process, with the number of threads controlled by the `nthreads` parameter. The `transform_pig_latin!` function is run within each thread and updates the output vector directly.\n\nTo use this function, you would simply do:\n\n```julia\ntexts = [\"Hello World\", \"Goodbye Universe\"]  # Example texts to be translated to pig latin\npig_latin_texts = pig_latinify(texts)\nprintln(pig_latin_texts)  # Output: [\"Helpay\", \"Gobyeay Universe\"]\n```\n\nPlease note that the `findnext` function is used to find the index of the first vowel. If no vowels are found, it assumes the end of the string as the location for the consonant prefix. The `wait.(threads)` command waits for all spawned threads to finish before returning the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,657],"elapsed":18.450933793,"_type":"aimessage"}]
