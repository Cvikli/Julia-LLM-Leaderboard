[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses threading to process each string in parallel. The actual transformation logic is done inside `pig_latinify_single`, which is run on separate threads using `Threads.@spawn`.\n\nThe `findnext` and `findprev` functions are used to find the position of the first vowel and the last consonant before the first vowel, respectively. The pig latin transformation rules are then applied based on these positions.\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes the use of Julia 1.7 or later due to the use of `findnext` and `findprev`, which are new in Julia 1.7. If you need to support earlier versions of Julia, you may need to implement similar functionality using regular expressions or other means.","status":200,"tokens":[0,681],"elapsed":19.663540684,"_type":"aimessage"}]
