We use `Future` type from Julia's concurrency package to wait for the results of each task.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_chunk` function is where the actual transformation of the text to pig latin takes place. It uses a simple rule to translate the first letter of the word followed by \"ay\" or \"way\" depending on the vowel sound of the first letter.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that each string in the vector can be translated to pig latin without issues (e.g., no special characters that would need special handling). Additionally, it's important to ensure that the length of the `texts` vector is a multiple of the number of threads to avoid race conditions or incomplete chunks.","status":200,"tokens":[0,706],"elapsed":19.607989809,"_type":"aimessage"}]
