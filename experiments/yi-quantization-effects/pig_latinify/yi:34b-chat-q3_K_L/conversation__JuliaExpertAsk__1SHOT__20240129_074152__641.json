It uses multiple threads to process the strings in parallel using an internal helper function `threaded_pig_latinify`. The actual transformation logic is left as a placeholder for you to implement.\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function wraps the multi-threaded processing inside `Threads.@spawn` and uses `take!` to retrieve the results from the tasks once they are completed. It is important to ensure that the result vector has enough capacity to hold all the transformed strings, which is why it is pre-allocated in the code above.","status":200,"tokens":[0,642],"elapsed":18.32451666,"_type":"aimessage"}]
