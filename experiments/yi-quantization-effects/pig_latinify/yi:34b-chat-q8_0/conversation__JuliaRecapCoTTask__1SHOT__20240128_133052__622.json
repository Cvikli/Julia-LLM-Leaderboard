Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Each task is responsible for translating one word into Pig Latin. The translation logic is encapsulated in the `translate_word` function, which is spawned as a separate task using `@spawn`.\n\nOnce all words within a sentence have been translated, they are concatenated and appended to the original text vector. For the first sentence, this will overwrite the original string with its Pig Latin translation. For subsequent sentences, the translated string is appended to the previous sentence's result, as instructed by the special instructions.\n\nThe `take!` function is used to retrieve the result of a future, and `collect` is used to ensure that we get all results without blocking the calling thread.\n\n## Double-check That the Solution is Correct\n\nTo double-check that the solution is correct:\n\n1. Ensure that the translation logic in `translate_word` correctly translates each word into Pig Latin.\n2. Verify that the parallelization using tasks is working as expected, and that all words are being translated without deadlock or other concurrency issues.\n3. Confirm that the appending of sentences is done correctly, with the first sentence overwritten and subsequent sentences appended to the previous one.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes the task of translating a word into Pig Latin can be done independently for each word. If there are dependencies between words within a sentence or if the instructions require handling of punctuation differently, those considerations would need to be addressed in the `translate_word` function and the way sentences are appended.","status":200,"tokens":[11,721],"elapsed":32.861808397,"_type":"aimessage"}]
