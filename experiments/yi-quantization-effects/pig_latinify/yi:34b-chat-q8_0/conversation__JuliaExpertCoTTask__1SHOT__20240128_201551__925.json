In this case, since we are only operating on local variables within a thread, there shouldn't be any issues with data race conditions.\n\nAlso, the pig latin rules implemented here are not exhaustive and may need adjustments for handling more complex words or edge cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,823],"elapsed":37.351390919,"_type":"aimessage"}]
