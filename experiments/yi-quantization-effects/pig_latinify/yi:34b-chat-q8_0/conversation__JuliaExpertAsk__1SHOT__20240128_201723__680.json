It uses the `@threads` macro from the `Threads` module to parallelize the translation process across multiple threads. Inside the threaded loop, it translates each word to Pig Latin according to the following rules:\n\n1. If the first letter is one of 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u', the whole word is appended with \"way\".\n2. Otherwise, the first letter is moved to the end and \"yay\" is appended.\n\nThe function assumes that the vector `words` contains valid English words. The translated words are accumulated into a string that is returned at the end of the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,371],"elapsed":16.694651977,"_type":"aimessage"}]
