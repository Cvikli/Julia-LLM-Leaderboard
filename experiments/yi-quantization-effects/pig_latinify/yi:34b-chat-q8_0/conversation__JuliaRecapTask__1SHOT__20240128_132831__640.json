[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The function also includes a custom `is_vowel` function to determine if a character is a vowel for the purpose of the pig latin rules.\n\nThe `@threads` macro from the `Base.Threads` module is used to parallelize the loop over words, ensuring that each word is processed by a separate thread. The `findfirst()` function is used within the `is_vowel` function to check if the character exists in the array of vowels without iterating through the entire array.\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes that the input strings are valid English words and does not perform any error checking or handling for invalid inputs.","status":200,"tokens":[377,470],"elapsed":21.569199138,"_type":"aimessage"}]
