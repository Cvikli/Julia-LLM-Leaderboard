[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `nthreads` keyword argument allows the user to specify how many threads should be used for the translation. If not specified, it defaults to 1 thread (sequential processing).\n\nThe function `translate_to_pig_latin` is defined within the `pig_latinify` function to handle the conversion of a single string to pig latin. It removes punctuation and splits the text into words. For each word, it decides whether it's the first word or not, and constructs the pig latin translation accordingly.\n\nThe `Threads.@threads` macro is used to iterate over the texts in parallel. Each thread will call `translate_to_pig_latin` on a different text element, and the results are collected back into the output vector.\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes that the input strings do not contain any characters other than letters (a-z), as it is designed for simplicity and educational purposes. In a real-world scenario, you would need to handle edge cases such as non-English characters, punctuation, and whitespace properly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,538],"elapsed":24.466759423,"_type":"aimessage"}]
