It uses the `@threads` macro to run the pig latinization of each string in parallel on separate threads. The `pig_latinize!` function is called for each element of the vector, and it is responsible for transforming the string into its pig latin equivalent.\n\nThe `pig_latinize!` function first checks if the first character of the string is a vowel. If so, it moves everything after the first vowel to the end of the word, preceded by \"ay\" (e.g., \"Hello\" becomes \"elloHay\").\n\nIf the first character is not a vowel, it searches for the first occurrence of a vowel in the string. If there are no vowels (which would be an error if the input were not pre-validated), it appends \"ay\" to the end of the word. If there is at least one vowel, it moves everything after the first vowel to the end of the word, including the preceding consonants up to but not including the first vowel.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes all strings in `strings` are valid English words, and it does not handle edge cases such as strings without vowels or non-alphabetic characters. Additionally, thread safety is not guaranteed for the global `strings` vector if it is modified outside of the `pig_latinify` function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,625],"elapsed":28.236306055,"_type":"aimessage"}]
