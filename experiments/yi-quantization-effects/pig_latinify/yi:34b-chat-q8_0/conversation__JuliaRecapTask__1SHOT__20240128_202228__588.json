[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses the built-in `Threads` module to parallelize the transformation across multiple threads. The `@threads` macro is used to parallelize the loop over each chunk of the words array. Within each thread, the `pig_latinify_word` function is called for each word in the chunk.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_word` function itself determines whether a word starts with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, or y) and applies the appropriate pig latin transformation: if it does, the word is suffixed with \"way\"; otherwise, everything but the first letter is moved to the front of the word, and the first letter followed by \"ay\" is appended.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes a 1-based indexing for the array `words` (consistent with the problem description). It also ensures that each word is processed exactly once by using an `enumerate` loop within the threaded region.","status":200,"tokens":[0,461],"elapsed":20.943404346,"_type":"aimessage"}]
