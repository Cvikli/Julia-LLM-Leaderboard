You can use the following rules to transform English words into their Pig Latin equivalent:\n\n1. Take the first consonant (or consonant cluster) of the word.\n2. Move it to the end of the word, after the last vowel. If there is no vowel, add an `h` at the end and move that.\n3. Attach \"-ay\" to the end of the word.\n4. If a word begins with a vowel, simply add \"-yay\" to the end.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\ndog -> dog-ay\ncat -> cat-ay\napple -> apple-ay\neat -> eat-hay\n```\n\nRemember to use `Task`s for asynchronous computation within threads if needed, as mentioned in the comments.","status":200,"tokens":[0,412],"elapsed":18.531760212,"_type":"aimessage"}]
