[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The work is divided into chunks based on the number of threads available, and each chunk is processed by a separate thread using `Threads.@spawn`.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_string` function follows the rules outlined in the special instructions to convert a single string to Pig Latin. It checks if the first letter is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u) and appends \"way\" if it is, or moves the first consonant to the end and adds \"ay\" otherwise.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you are using a version of Julia that supports `Threads` (Julia 1.6 or later). Also, the Pig Latin rules implementation may need adjustment based on the specific requirements for accuracy.","status":200,"tokens":[0,707],"elapsed":32.154901044,"_type":"aimessage"}]
