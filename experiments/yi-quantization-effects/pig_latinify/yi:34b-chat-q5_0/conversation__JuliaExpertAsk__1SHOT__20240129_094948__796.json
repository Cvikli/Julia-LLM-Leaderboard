It uses `@spawn` to spawn a new thread for each string in the vector, which then calls `pig_latinify_thread` to convert the string to Pig Latin. The `wait` function is used to wait for all threads to finish, and `fetch` is used to retrieve the results from each future object. Finally, the results are collected into a vector and returned.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_thread` function itself splits the input string into characters, finds the tail (last) part of the word, and then recombines the word with \"ay\" appended to the end, following the rules of Pig Latin.","status":200,"tokens":[0,331],"elapsed":10.514248286,"_type":"aimessage"}]
