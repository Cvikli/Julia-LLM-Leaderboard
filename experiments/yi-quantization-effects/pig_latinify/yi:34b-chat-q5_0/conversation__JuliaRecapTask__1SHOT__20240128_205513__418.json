[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin.

It checks if the word starts with a vowel or is empty; if so, it appends \"way\" to the word. Otherwise, it splits the word into its first character and the remaining characters and concatenates them in reverse order with \"ay\" at the end.\n\nTo use this function, you would simply call it with a vector of strings:\n\n```julia\njulia> pig_latinify([\"dog\", \"apple\", \"banana\"])\n3-element Vector{String}:\n \"ogday\"\n \"ppleway\"\n \"ananaay\"\n```\n\nThe function returns a new vector containing the pig latin translations of each word in the original vector.","status":200,"tokens":[0,339],"elapsed":10.909987209,"_type":"aimessage"}]
