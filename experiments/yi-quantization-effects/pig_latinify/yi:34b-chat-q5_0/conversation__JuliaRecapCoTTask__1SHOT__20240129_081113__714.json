[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(texts::Vector{String})\n    # Create an output vector of the same length as texts to store the translated strings\n    pig_latin_texts = Vector{String}(undef, length(texts))\n    \n    # Define a function to translate a single string to pig latin\n    function translate_to_pig_latin(text::String)\n        # Split text into characters\n        chars = collect(text)\n        \n        # Remove the first character (consonant or vowel) from the front of the word\n        first_char = popfirst!(chars)\n        \n        # Prepend 'ay' to the end of the word if the first character is a consonant\n        if !isalpha(first_char) || isspace(first_char) || isvowel(first_char)\n            return join(chars, \"\") * \"ay\"\n        else\n            # Otherwise, prepend it to the beginning of the word and add 'ay' at the end\n            return first_char * join(chars, \"\") * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Use multiple threads to translate each string in parallel\n    @threads for i in 1:length(texts)\n        pig_latin_texts[i] = translate_to_pig_latin(texts[i])\n    end\n    \n    return pig_latin_texts\nend\n```\n\nThis function defines a recursive method to translate a single string to Pig Latin. It then uses `@threads` to run this translation in parallel for each string in the vector, leveraging multiple threads. The `@threads` macro is used to iterate over an iterable object and run the body of the loop in parallel using as many threads as possible.\n\nTo ensure that the solution is correct, you can test it with a simple example:\n\n```julia\ntexts = [\"dog\", \"cat\", \"apple\"]\npig_latinified_texts = pig_latinify(texts)\nprintln(pig_latinified_texts)  # Should print something like [\"ogday\", \"atay\", \"applepay\"]\n```\n\nRemember to check for any special instructions provided by the user. If there are none, this solution should be sufficient for the task described.","status":200,"tokens":[0,538],"elapsed":17.412384726,"_type":"aimessage"}]
