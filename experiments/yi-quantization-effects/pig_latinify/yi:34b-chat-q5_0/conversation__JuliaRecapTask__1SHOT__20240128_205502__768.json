[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The transformation is done in parallel using Julia's built-in multithreading functionality via the `@threads` macro.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function handles the actual translation from English to Pig Latin. It accounts for words that start with a vowel by appending \"way\", and for words that start with a consonant by dropping the first letter and appending \"ay\" to the rest of the word.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you are working in an environment where multithreading is available and safe to use. If you are running Julia on a single-threaded system or if threading is not appropriate for your context, you would need to adjust the `pig_latinify` function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,379],"elapsed":12.212000568,"_type":"aimessage"}]
