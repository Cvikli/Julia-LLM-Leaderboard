[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    threads = Vector{Future}()\n    for word in words\n        push!(threads, @spawn pig_latinify_word(word))\n    end\n    return collect(fetch.(threads))\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_word(word)\n    vowels = \"aeiouy\"\n    if word[1] in vowels\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        return join([word[2:end], word[1]], \"ay\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\n# Checking Correctness\n\nTo check the correctness of the solution, we can test it with some example strings and ensure that they are transformed correctly into their pig latin counterparts. Here's a simple test:\n\n```julia\n@testset \"Pig Latin Transformer\" begin\n    @test pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]) == [\"ellohway\", \"appleway\", \"strongeay\", \"orldway\"]\nend\n```\n\nThis test should pass if the `pig_latinify` function is working correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,280],"elapsed":8.903491185,"_type":"aimessage"}]
