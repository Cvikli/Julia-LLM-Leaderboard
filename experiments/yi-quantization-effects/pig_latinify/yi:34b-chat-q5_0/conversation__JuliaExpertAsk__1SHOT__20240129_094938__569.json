The `pig_latinify` function is a skeleton that uses Julia's multithreading capabilities via thread pools to translate each string in parallel. You would need to define the actual translation logic within the `translate_to_pig_latin` function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,308],"elapsed":9.788979865,"_type":"aimessage"}]
