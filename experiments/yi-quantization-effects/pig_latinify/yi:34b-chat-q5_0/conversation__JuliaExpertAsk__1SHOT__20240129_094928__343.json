It initializes an empty result vector and then uses the `@threads` macro to parallelize the loop over each string. The `@threads` macro makes the loop body run concurrently on different threads, with each thread processing one or more elements of the input vector.\n\nInside the threaded loop, the Pig Latin translation logic is implemented. A variable `vowel_found` is used to determine if a vowel has been encountered in the word. If so, the word is translated into Pig Latin by adding \"ay\" at the end. If not, each character from the second (or first if a vowel was found) character onward is appended to the Pig Latin translation.\n\nFinally, the result vector is returned with the translated strings. Note that this code assumes that the input strings do not contain any null characters or other control characters that would cause issues in the translation logic.","status":200,"tokens":[0,517],"elapsed":16.511577074,"_type":"aimessage"}]
