[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

This function is threadsafe because it doesn't modify any shared state or use any global variables.\n\nWe then use the `@threads` macro from the `ThreadingUtilities` package to parallelize the translation over the vector of strings. The `nthreads()` function is used to determine the number of available threads on the system, and we pass this as an argument to `pig_latinify` so that users can specify a different number of threads if desired.\n\nThe `@threads` macro wraps a for loop and distributes the iterations across multiple threads. It ensures that each string is translated in its own thread without any shared state modifications, making it safe for concurrent execution.\n\n### Note on Performance\n\nPlease note that Pig Latin translation itself is not computationally intensive and does not benefit much from parallelization unless the text contains very long words or phrases with complex pronunciation rules that require significant CPU time per word. In such cases, the actual overhead of thread management might outweigh the benefits of parallelization for this particular task.","status":200,"tokens":[0,830],"elapsed":22.53270265,"_type":"aimessage"}]
