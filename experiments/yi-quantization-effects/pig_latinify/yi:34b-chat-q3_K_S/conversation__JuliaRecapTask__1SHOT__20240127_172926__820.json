X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

We create a channel to send tasks and a vector to store the futures of those tasks.\n2. For each word in the vector, we asynchronously run the `pig_latinify_word` function inside a task with a local reference to its future result.\n3. To avoid blocking the main thread, we use `waiting = true` initially and then wait for a task to complete or open using a loop that checks if the first task is open (`isopen(tasks[1])`). If not, it takes the next available task from the channel `tasks`.\n4. The `pig_latinify_word` function handles converting the word to pig latin by checking if the first letter is a vowel or not. It also accounts for uppercase and lowercase letters when determining the first letter of a word.\n5. The `firstletter`, `uppercasefirst`, `lowercasefirst`, and `tail` functions are helper functions to deal with the specifics of converting words in pig latin.\n6. Finally, we return the vector of futures, which can be used to collect the results when needed.\n\n### Usage Example\n\n```julia\nusing Base: @async\n\n# Example vector of strings to convert to pig latin\nwords = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n\n# Call the pig_latinify function\nresults = pig_latinify(words)\n\n# Collect all futures and print results\nfor result in results\n    println(fetch(result))\nend\n```\n\n### Notes\n\n- This implementation uses `@async` to start each task asynchronously, which can be a performance optimization if the tasks are truly independent. However, it does not ensure that the tasks will run in separate threads; they could still run sequentially on a single thread under certain conditions (e.g., if the tasks take too long to complete).\n- The `Channel` type is used for task scheduling and communication. It's a lightweight synchronization primitive that allows passing items between two concurrent routines.\n- The `Future` type is used to represent the eventual result of an asynchronous computation. It abstracts away the details of thread management and provides a simple way to wait for the completion of a task without blocking other tasks.\n- Since this is a toy example, we don't need to worry about edge cases like very long words or words that are already in pig latin. In practice, you might want to add error handling for invalid inputs.","status":200,"tokens":[0,992],"elapsed":26.955648683,"_type":"aimessage"}]
