X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses the `@async` macro to run the translation of each string in parallel, and then waits for all threads to finish before returning the result vector. The translation itself is done within an asynchronous task using `@spawnable` and `Threads.@spawnable` to ensure that the pig latin transformation is done in parallel across multiple threads.\n\nThe function `_pig_latinify` is a helper function used by `pig_latinify` to actually perform the translation of a single string. It uses a local variable to track if the result has been calculated, and yields control back to the scheduler until it's time to process the current string. This ensures that only one thread at a time calculates the pig latin transformation for a given string, which is necessary to prevent race conditions in the multi-threaded case.","status":200,"tokens":[0,612],"elapsed":17.27975989,"_type":"aimessage"}]
