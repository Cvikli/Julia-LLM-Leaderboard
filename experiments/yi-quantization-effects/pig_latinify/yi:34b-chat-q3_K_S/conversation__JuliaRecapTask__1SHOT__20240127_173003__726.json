[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It calculates the number of threads and splits the work into chunks, processing each chunk asynchronously using `@async`.\n- The `pig_latinify_chunk` function is where the actual work of translating strings to Pig Latin is done. It is called for each chunk within a separate thread.\n- The `pig_latinify_text` function translates individual strings by breaking them into words and then constructing the Pig Latin version using a suffix (`ay`) or `shay` if the word begins with a vowel sound.\n- The `vowel` function is used to determine if a character is a vowel in English for deciding which suffix to use.\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes that the input strings do not contain any punctuation marks and that all characters are valid ASCII characters. If you need to handle non-English text or special characters, you would need to modify the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,884],"elapsed":24.010376947,"_type":"aimessage"}]
