It uses threading to run the transformation on multiple threads simultaneously, using an asynchronous `async` block for each word. The `join_threads` function is used to collect the results from all the threads.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_word` function determines whether a word starts with a vowel sound and handles the pig latin transformation accordingly. It uses a utility function `first_letter` to get the first letter of the word asynchronously, which is also used in the `async` block within `pig_latinify`.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you are using a version of Julia that supports async/await and threads, such as Julia 1.5 or later.","status":200,"tokens":[0,485],"elapsed":13.537399073,"_type":"aimessage"}]
