This macro automatically adjusts the number of iterations based on the available threads in the pool.\n- Inside the loop, each string is translated into its Pig Latin equivalent and stored in the corresponding position of `output_strings`.\n- The `pig_latinify_string` function is a simple example of how to translate a single string into Pig Latin using regular expressions. It handles only a subset of possible inputs; for a more robust implementation, you would need to account for various edge cases and non-English characters.\n\nPlease note that the `ThreadPools` package must be installed before this code will work:\n\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"ThreadPools\")\n```\n\nAlso, ensure that you're using a recent version of Julia that supports threads and thread pools (Julia 1.5 or later).","status":200,"tokens":[69,633],"elapsed":21.86761491,"_type":"aimessage"}]
