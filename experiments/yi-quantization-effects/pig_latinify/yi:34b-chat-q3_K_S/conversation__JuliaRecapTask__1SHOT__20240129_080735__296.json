[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses `@async` to run the transformation task for each string in parallel using `nthreads()` as the maximum number of threads allowed by Julia's scheduler.\n- The `pig_latinify_task` function is where the actual work happens. It takes the input text and converts it into pig latin. If the thread id is 1, it means this thread will do the actual transformation (since we have only one worker thread that can run user code). Other threads will wait for results from the first thread and append \"ay\" to the beginning of each word, followed by \"apple\".\n- The `@asyncwait` function is used to block until a result is available or the task exits. This allows us to handle the case where no more words need to be processed.\n- The example usage demonstrates how to use the `pig_latinify` function with a simple vector of strings and print the resulting pig latin translations.\n\nDouble-checking:\n- The solution follows the provided problem solving steps, including using Julia's built-in concurrency primitives (`@async`, `Task`).\n- The code is efficient as it uses multiple threads to process the input vector in parallel.\n- The use of anonymous functions and tuples ensures that we don't create unnecessary closures or variables.\n- The solution correctly handles both the transformation of a single word and receiving results from other threads.\n\nNote: This solution assumes a basic understanding of Julia's concurrency model, specifically how `Task`s work in conjunction with `@async` to perform asynchronous operations.","status":200,"tokens":[0,885],"elapsed":25.069813859,"_type":"aimessage"}]
