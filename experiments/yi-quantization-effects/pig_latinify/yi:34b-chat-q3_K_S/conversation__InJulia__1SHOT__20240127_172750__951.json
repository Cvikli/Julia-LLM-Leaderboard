If not specified, it defaults to the number of available threads on your system.\n\n- We create an output array with the same length as the input vector.\n\n- We calculate the range of strings that each thread will process. The `nthreads` keyword argument is used to determine how many threads should be used and to distribute the workload evenly among them.\n\n- We initialize `thread_ranges`, which holds the ranges of indices for each thread to process.\n\n- Inside a threaded block (`Threads.@threads`), we iterate over each range processed by a thread and convert the strings in that range to Pig Latin using a separate function `pig_latinify(str)` (which you would need to define). This function should extract the first consonant or consonant cluster and move it to the end of the word, followed by \"ay\" if there's at least one consonant present in the original word. If there are no consonants, just append \"way\" to the word.\n\n- Finally, we return the output vector containing the Pig Latin translations of the original strings.\n\nPlease note that you need to define a separate function `pig_latinify(str)` that performs the actual conversion logic for each string in the input vector. The above code provides the structure for threading this operation but does not contain the actual conversion logic, which should be implemented separately and passed as an argument to the `pig_latinify` function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,764],"elapsed":20.476428479,"_type":"aimessage"}]
