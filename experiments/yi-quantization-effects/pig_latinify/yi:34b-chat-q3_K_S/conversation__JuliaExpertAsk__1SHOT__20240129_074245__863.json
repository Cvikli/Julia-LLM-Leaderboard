It uses `Threads.nthreads()` to determine how many threads to use for the computation. The transformation is done by two functions:\n\n1. `pig_latinify`: This function creates chunks of the input vector that will be processed by individual threads, starts each thread with a buffered channel to communicate the work items, and then waits for all threads to finish their work.\n\n2. `pig_latinify_thread`: This function is run inside an async block by each thread to actually perform the pig latin transformation on a given string. It uses `split` and `join` to rearrange the characters in the correct order for pig latin without using any explicit looping logic.\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function returns a new vector containing the transformed strings from all threads.","status":200,"tokens":[0,710],"elapsed":19.805991577,"_type":"aimessage"}]
