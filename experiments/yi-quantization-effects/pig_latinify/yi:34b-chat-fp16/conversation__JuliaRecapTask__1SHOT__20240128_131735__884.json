[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin.

The pig latin translation follows these rules:\n\n- If the first letter is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), add \"way\" to the end of the word.\n- If the first letter is not a vowel, take the first consonant (or consonant cluster) and move it to the end of the word, then add \"ay\". If there's more than one initial consonant, only the first is moved.\n\nThe `@threads` macro provided by the `Threads` standard library allows each iteration of the loop to run in a separate thread, which can speed up the processing if the strings are long and the transformations are computationally intensive. However, it's worth noting that string operations in Julia are generally not highly parallelizable due to the overhead of creating and managing threads.\n\nTo ensure correct behavior, we should always test our code:\n\n```julia\nusing Test\n\n@testset \"Pig Latin Transformer\" begin\n    original_words = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"dog\", \"eggplant\"]\n    expected_pig_latin_words = [\"appleway\", \"bananaway\", \"cherryay\", \"dogay\", \"eggplantay\"]\n\n    pig_latinified_words = pig_latinify(original_words)\n\n    @test pig_latinified_words == expected_pig_latin_words\nend\n```\n\nThis test checks that the `pig_latinify` function works as expected for a set of sample words.","status":200,"tokens":[0,626],"elapsed":48.91209592,"_type":"aimessage"}]
