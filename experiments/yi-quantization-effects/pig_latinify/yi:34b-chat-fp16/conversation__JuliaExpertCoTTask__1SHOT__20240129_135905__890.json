It uses `Threads.@spawn` to spawn a new thread for each word, and then waits for all threads to finish using `Threads.wait`. The result is collected in a vector and returned.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_word` function handles the actual transformation of a single word into pig latin based on whether it starts with a vowel or not.","status":200,"tokens":[0,319],"elapsed":24.753126032,"_type":"aimessage"}]
