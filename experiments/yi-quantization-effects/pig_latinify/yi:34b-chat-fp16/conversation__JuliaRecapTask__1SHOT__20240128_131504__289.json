[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses the `@threads` macro provided by Julia's `Threads` module to iterate over the vector and apply the `pig_latinize` function to each element in parallel.\n\nThe `pig_latinize` function itself is a simple translator that takes a word and returns its pig latin equivalent. It handles both cases where the word starts with a vowel (in which case it appends \"ay\") and where it starts with a consonant (in which case it moves the first letter to the end and appends \"ay\").\n\nPlease note that the `@threads` macro does not automatically vectorize loops. It simply enables parallel execution of iterations within the loop by creating multiple threads to work on different parts of the loop concurrently. This is known as thread-level parallelism, which can be useful for tasks that are embarrassingly parallel (like the one described in this task).\n\nRemember to enable multi-threading in your Julia session before using `@threads` by calling `Threads.nthreads()` or setting environment variables such as `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` or `NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS` (on Windows) to the desired number of threads.","status":200,"tokens":[377,475],"elapsed":37.163857881,"_type":"aimessage"}]
