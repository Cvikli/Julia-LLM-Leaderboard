[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The transformation is done in parallel using `@threads` macro, which allows each thread to process a chunk of the input vector. The `chunksize` and `remainder` are calculated based on the number of threads and the length of the word vector to ensure proper distribution of work.\n\nThe `convert_to_pig_latin` function implements a simple set of rules for converting words to pig latin. It checks if the first letter is a vowel and applies different transformations accordingly.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you are using a Julia version that supports the `@threads` macro, which was introduced in Julia 1.5. If you are using an earlier version, you may need to use other parallelization techniques or update your Julia installation.","status":200,"tokens":[0,677],"elapsed":52.887878214,"_type":"aimessage"}]
