[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It splits the input vector into chunks that can be processed by each thread using `Threads.nthreads()` to determine the number of threads and `ceil(Int, length(words) / num_threads)` to calculate the chunk size.\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function uses `@threads` macro to parallelize the processing of each chunk across multiple threads. The `pig_latinify_word` function is used within the loop to convert individual words to pig latin. This function handles the edge case where a word starts with a vowel and the common case where it does not.\n\nThe output vector is recombined by iterating over the results of each thread and collecting non-empty strings.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you are using at least Julia version 1.5, as `@threads` was introduced in that version.","status":200,"tokens":[0,604],"elapsed":47.179170551,"_type":"aimessage"}]
