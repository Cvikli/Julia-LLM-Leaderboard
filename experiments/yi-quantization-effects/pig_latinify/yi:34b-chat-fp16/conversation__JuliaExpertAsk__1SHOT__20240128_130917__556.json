It does this by spawning a separate thread for each string using the `@spawn` macro from the `Base.Threads` module. The `Future` type is used to handle the asynchronous execution of the tasks.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_thread` function actually performs the transformation of a single string into pig latin, which involves adding \"ay\" to the end of each non-empty word, and moving the first letter of the word to the end if it's not already part of the \"ay\" suffix.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you are using a recent version of Julia with support for multiple threads. The `@spawn` macro is available since Julia 1.5, and before that, you would have to use `Threads.@spawn`. Additionally, the `Future` type was introduced in Julia 1.2, so if you are using an older version, you may need to adapt this code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,545],"elapsed":42.350863666,"_type":"aimessage"}]
