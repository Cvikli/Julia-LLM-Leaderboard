[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It calculates the number of threads to use with `Threads.nthreads()` and then divides the texts into chunks for parallel processing. Each thread processes a chunk of the text vector, calling the `pig_latinify_string` function to convert individual strings to pig latin.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_string` function handles the actual transformation of a string to pig latin. It checks if the first character is a vowel or \"y\" followed by a vowel, and if so, it appends \"way\" to the original text. Otherwise, it moves the first character to the end and adds \"ay\".\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function ensures that each thread works on a separate chunk of the input vector, which guarantees parallelism. The results from all threads are collected into a new vector and returned as the output.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you are running on a system with multiple cores. If you run it on a single-core system, it will still work but not take advantage of parallel processing.","status":200,"tokens":[0,708],"elapsed":55.310802763,"_type":"aimessage"}]
