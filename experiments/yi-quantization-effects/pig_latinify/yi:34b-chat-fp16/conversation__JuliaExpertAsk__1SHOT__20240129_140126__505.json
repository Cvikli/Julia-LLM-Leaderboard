The `@threads` macro is used to run the loop iterations on separate threads, which can speed up the processing if the work is parallelizable.\n\nIn this implementation, if a string is empty, we skip it. Otherwise, we extract the first letter and the rest of the word and concatenate them in Pig Latin fashion (appending \"ay\" to the end). The resulting vector of strings is then returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,240],"elapsed":18.585888461,"_type":"aimessage"}]
