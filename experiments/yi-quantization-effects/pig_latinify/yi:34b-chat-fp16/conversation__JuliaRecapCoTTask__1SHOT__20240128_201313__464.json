[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

If there are specific instructions or requirements, please provide them, and I'll update the solution accordingly.\n\nHere is a systematic approach to solving this task using Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads: @threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(input_strings::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Initialize an output vector with the same length as input_strings\n    output_strings = Vector{String}(undef, length(input_strings))\n\n    # Define a function to translate a single string to pig latin\n    function translate_to_pig_latin(s::AbstractString)::String\n        # Example pig latin translation rules:\n        #   - Words starting with a vowel are followed by \"ay\"\n        #   - Other words are moved to the end of the sentence, preceded by \"ay\"\n        vowels = Dict('a' => true, 'e' => true, 'i' => true, 'o' => true, 'u' => true)\n        first_vowel_idx = findfirst(c -> vowels[c], s) do c\n            c == lowercase(c) ? uppercase(c) : c  # Ensure we search for uppercase characters\n        end\n        if first_vowel_idx !== nothing\n            return \"$s ay\"\n        else\n            return join([s[first_vowel_idx + 1:end], s[1:first_vowel_idx - 1], \"ay\"])\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Use threads to translate each string in parallel\n    @threads for (i, s) in enumerate(input_strings)\n        output_strings[i] = translate_to_pig_latin(s)\n    end\n\n    return output_strings\nend\n```\n\nThis function defines a `pig_latinify` that takes a vector of strings as input and returns a vector of the same length containing the pig latin translations. It uses `@threads` to parallelize the translation process across all threads available in the system. Each thread is responsible for translating one string from the input vector.\n\nThe `translate_to_pig_latin` function defines the rules for translating a single string into its pig latin equivalent, handling both cases where the word starts with a vowel and where it doesn't.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes all necessary dependencies are installed (e.g., Julia itself and the `Threads` module). If you encounter any issues or have specific requirements for the task, please provide more information, and I'll be happy to assist further.","status":200,"tokens":[0,629],"elapsed":49.1487694,"_type":"aimessage"}]
