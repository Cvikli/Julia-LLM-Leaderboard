[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

This is a simple way to determine whether a word should be translated into Pig Latin.\n- The `pig_latin_rule` function applies the rule for transforming a word into Pig Latin, handling both the case where the word starts with a consonant and the case where it starts with a vowel.\n- The `pig_latinify` function is the main entry point that transforms an array of strings into their Pig Latin equivalents using threads.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you have a list of English stop words available, which I've represented as `STOPWORDS`. You would need to define or load this list in your environment for the code to work correctly. Additionally, this implementation may not cover all edge cases in Pig Latin translation, but it should handle common cases well.","status":200,"tokens":[0,763],"elapsed":59.683721493,"_type":"aimessage"}]
