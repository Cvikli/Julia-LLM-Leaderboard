[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The function uses the `@threads` macro to parallelize the transformation over each word in the vector. It ensures that the number of threads used is equal to the number of available processors and that the work is divided equally among them, with any remainder being handled by the last thread.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_word` function defines the rules for transforming a single word into Pig Latin. The first letter of the word is appended to the end along with \"ay\", and if the second letter of the word (or the first letter if there's no second letter) is one of the five vowels, then an \"h\" is prepended to the Pig Latin word.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes a Unicode-compliant Julia version, where `'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, and `'u'` are considered vowels regardless of case.","status":200,"tokens":[0,664],"elapsed":51.86846399,"_type":"aimessage"}]
