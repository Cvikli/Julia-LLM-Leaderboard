[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `transform_word_to_pig_latin` function defines how to convert a single word into its pig latin equivalent. It checks if the first letter is a vowel or consonant and applies the appropriate transformation rules. If the first character is not a letter, it simply returns the original word.\n\nThe `@threads` macro ensures that each iteration of the loop is executed in a separate thread, which can lead to significant speed improvements for large vectors of strings if the computer has multiple cores available.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes all input strings are valid UTF-8 encoded text and does not perform any error checking or handling. It also does not account for words that are not English or do not follow traditional English spelling rules, which might require additional logic to handle correctly in pig latin.","status":200,"tokens":[0,492],"elapsed":38.40183587,"_type":"aimessage"}]
