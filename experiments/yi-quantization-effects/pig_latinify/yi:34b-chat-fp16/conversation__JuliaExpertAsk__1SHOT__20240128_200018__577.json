It then waits for all threads to finish using `Threads.wait.(tasks)`. The `pig_latinify_single` function is where the actual transformation takes place. It checks if the first character of the string is a vowel and applies the appropriate pig latin rule.","status":200,"tokens":[96,269],"elapsed":20.869969053,"_type":"aimessage"}]
