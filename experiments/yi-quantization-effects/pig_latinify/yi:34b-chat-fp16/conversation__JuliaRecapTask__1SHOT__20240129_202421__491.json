[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `@threads` macro from the `Threads` module is used to parallelize the transformation over each string in the vector. The `convert_to_pig_latin` function does the actual conversion for each word, handling the rules for vowels and 'y' followed by a vowel.\n\nThe `is_vowel_or_y` function checks if the first character of the word is a vowel or 'y' followed by a space or another vowel (this accounts for \"y\" acting as a vowel). If it isn't, the first character is moved to the end of the word. Finally, \"ay\" is appended to the word to complete the pig latin transformation.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you are using at least Julia 1.3, which introduced the `@threads` macro for parallel loops.","status":200,"tokens":[0,584],"elapsed":45.689446506,"_type":"aimessage"}]
