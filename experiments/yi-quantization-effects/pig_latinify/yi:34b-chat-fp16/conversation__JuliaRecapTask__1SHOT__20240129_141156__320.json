[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The transformation itself is encapsulated within the `pig_latinify_word` function, which splits the word on hyphens, removes any leading apostrophes (for possessive forms), and then reassembles the word by moving the first part to the end and appending \"ay\".\n\nThe main `pig_latinify` function iterates over each word in the vector and calls `pig_latinify_word` to perform the transformation. To run this on separate threads, we use the `@threads` macro provided by Julia's standard library. This macro is a convenience wrapper around `Threads.@spawn` and `fetch` that automatically spawns a new thread for each iteration of the loop and waits for all spawned threads to finish before continuing with the next iteration.\n\nThe example usage at the end demonstrates how to apply the `pig_latinify` function to a vector of words and print out the resulting pig latin translations.","status":200,"tokens":[0,625],"elapsed":48.812529961,"_type":"aimessage"}]
