[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Each thread will process a subset of the words in parallel. The `pig_latinify` function itself is quite simple and follows the rules for translating English into Pig Latin:\n\n1. If a word begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u) or has \"qu\" at the beginning, add \"ay\" to the end of the word.\n2. If a word begins with a consonant other than \"q\" or \"qu\", move that initial consonant and any following consonants (including \"y\" when it's used as a consonant) to the end of the word and add \"ay\".\n3. For words starting with \"qu\", if there is no \"u\" after the \"q\", treat it like a consonant and follow rule 2. If there is a \"u\" after the \"q\", it's considered a vowel sound, so apply the first rule.\n\nThe function also handles empty strings by adding just the first letter followed by \"ay\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,559],"elapsed":43.730962388,"_type":"aimessage"}]
