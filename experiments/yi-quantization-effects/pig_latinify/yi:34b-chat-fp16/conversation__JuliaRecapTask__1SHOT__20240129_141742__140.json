[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `@threads` macro is a convenient way to run a loop over multiple threads without having to write boilerplate code for thread management. Each iteration of the loop is executed in its own thread, and the results are collected back into the original vector.\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function first checks that the input vector is not empty, then creates an output vector with the same length as the input, and finally uses a threaded loop to apply the transformation function to each word in the input vector. The transformation function itself is defined within the `pig_latinify` function to keep everything self-contained.\n\nPlease note that using threads can sometimes lead to subtle bugs if the code is not carefully written, especially when it comes to sharing mutable state between threads. In this case, since each word transformation is independent and does not modify any shared data, threading can be used safely.","status":200,"tokens":[0,442],"elapsed":34.488257486,"_type":"aimessage"}]
