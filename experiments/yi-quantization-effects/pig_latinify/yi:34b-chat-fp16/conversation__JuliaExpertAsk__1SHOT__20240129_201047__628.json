The pig latin translation rule is implemented within the loop, where each word is checked for a vowel at the beginning and translated accordingly. If the first letter is not a vowel, all leading consonants (and 'y' if it's there) are moved to the end of the word followed by \"ay\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,349],"elapsed":27.108049762,"_type":"aimessage"}]
