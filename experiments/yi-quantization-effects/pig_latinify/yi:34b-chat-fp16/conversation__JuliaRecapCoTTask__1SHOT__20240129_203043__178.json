[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses the `@spawn` macro to spawn a new thread for each string in the vector, and then waits for all threads to finish using `wait.(threads)`. The `fetch` function is used to retrieve the results from each future object.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_impl` function is where the actual transformation takes place. It finds the first vowel (a, e, i, o, u) in the string and moves all characters after it to the beginning of the word, followed by \"ay\". If there's no vowel, it just appends \"ay\" to the end of the word.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you are using a Julia version that supports `@spawn` for strings (which was added in Julia 1.7). Additionally, the pig latin translation is a simplified version that does not account for all possible cases such as consonant clusters or special characters.","status":200,"tokens":[11,472],"elapsed":36.921209629,"_type":"aimessage"}]
