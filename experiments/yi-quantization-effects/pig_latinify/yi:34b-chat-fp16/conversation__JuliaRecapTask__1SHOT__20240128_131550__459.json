[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The function is written in a way that adheres to the provided guidelines and takes advantage of Julia's syntax and features. It uses `@threads` macro to parallelize the loop over the strings, ensuring that each iteration runs on a separate thread.\n\nThe pig latin transformation rules are implemented using regular expressions and string manipulation functions. The function also handles empty strings by making them translate to \"ay\" in pig latin.\n\nThe example usage at the end of the code demonstrates how `pig_latinify` can be used with a vector of strings, and it prints out the result after transforming the input strings into their pig latin counterparts.","status":200,"tokens":[0,592],"elapsed":46.262843746,"_type":"aimessage"}]
