Here's how you can define the function:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(texts)\n    nthreads = nworkers()\n    chunksize = length(texts) รท nthreads\n\n    # Initialize an output vector of the same size as the input vector\n    pig_latin_texts = Vector{String}(undef, length(texts))\n\n    @threads for i in eachindex(texts)\n        if i % chunksize == 0 && i > 0\n            # If we're at the beginning of a chunk, print progress\n            println(\"\\rProcessing chunk $i / $(nthreads)\")\n        end\n\n        # Get the current string and convert it to pig latin\n        current_text = texts[i]\n        pig_latin_texts[i] = pig_latin(current_text)\n    end\n\n    println(\"\\rFinished processing all chunks. Transforming results into a vector.\")\n\n    # Collect the results from each thread and return them as a vector\n    return collect(pig_latin_texts)\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(text)\n    # Example pig latin conversion rules:\n    #   - If the first letter is a vowel, add \"way\" to the end.\n    #   - Otherwise, move everything except the first consonant and any following vowels to the end, and then add \"ay\".\n    vowels = 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'\n    if text[1] in vowels\n        return text * \"way\"\n    else\n        consonants = String(text[2:end])\n        vowel_position = findfirst(x -> x in vowels, consonants)\n        if isnothing(vowel_position)\n            # No vowel found, so the entire word is a consonant cluster (e.g., \"snth\")\n            return text * \"ay\"\n        else\n            # Move the first consonant and any following vowels to the end\n            return String(text[1:vowel_position - 1]) * consonants * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. Determines how many threads to use based on the number of available workers (`nworkers()`).\n2. Calculates the chunk size by dividing the length of `texts` by the number of threads.\n3. Loops over each string in the vector, converting it to pig latin using the `pig_latin` function.\n4. Prints a progress message at the beginning of each chunk to indicate processing status.\n5. Collects the results from all threads into a vector and returns them.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you have the `Threads` package imported and that it uses the default number of workers available in your Julia environment. If you want to specify a different number of threads, you can do so by adjusting the `nthreads` variable before using the `@threads` macro.","status":200,"tokens":[0,751],"elapsed":58.537811918,"_type":"aimessage"}]
