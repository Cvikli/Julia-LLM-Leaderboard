[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It does this by splitting the work across multiple threads using `Threads.@threads`. The actual translation to pig latin is done within a closure passed to `process_vector_threads`, which ensures that each chunk of words is processed in parallel.\n\nThe function `translate_to_pig_latin` handles the transformation logic, using regexes to determine if a word starts with a vowel or not. If it does, the word is simply appended with \"ay\"; otherwise, the first letter is removed and the corresponding pig latin suffix is added.\n\nThe `process_vector_threads` function divides the input vector into four chunks and applies the provided function to each chunk in parallel using threads. This is a simple way to parallelize the processing of a vector without having to manage thread creation manually.\n\nOverall, the solution follows best practices for performance by using multiple threads where appropriate and ensuring that the transformation logic is efficient and clear.","status":200,"tokens":[0,753],"elapsed":58.906300927,"_type":"aimessage"}]
