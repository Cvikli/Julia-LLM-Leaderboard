It creates a separate thread for each word using `@async` and waits for all the threads to finish before joining the results together with spaces.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_thread` function is where the actual transformation takes place. It splits the input string into its first letter (a \"word\") and the rest of the string, moves the first letter to the end, and then appends 'ay' to form the Pig Latin version of the word.","status":200,"tokens":[0,357],"elapsed":27.681188732,"_type":"aimessage"}]
