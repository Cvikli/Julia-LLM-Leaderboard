[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses `Base.Threads.@spawn` to spawn a new thread for each word in the vector, which calls the `pig_latinify_single` function to convert the word to Pig Latin. The `wait.(threads)` command waits for all threads to finish before returning the results.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_single` function takes a single string and converts it to Pig Latin by taking the rest of the word after the first letter and appending \"ay\" to it, while also including the first letter at the beginning.","status":200,"tokens":[0,308],"elapsed":24.065232452,"_type":"aimessage"}]
