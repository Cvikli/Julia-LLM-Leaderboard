It divides the strings into chunks based on the number of threads available and then uses `@sync` to ensure that all threads have completed their work before the program continues. Each chunk is processed asynchronously using `@async` to run on separate threads.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_string` function itself contains the logic for translating a single string into Pig Latin. It splits the input string into words, and for each word, it checks if the first letter is a vowel or not. If it's a vowel, the entire word is moved to the end with \"way\" appended. If it's not a vowel, the first letter is moved to the end along with \"ay\" appended. Finally, all the words are joined back together with spaces.","status":200,"tokens":[0,548],"elapsed":42.576607263,"_type":"aimessage"}]
