It checks if the first letter of the word is a vowel and applies the appropriate transformation for pig latin. If not, it moves the first consonant (or the entire word if there's no vowel) to the end and adds \"ay\" to form the pig latin version.","status":200,"tokens":[0,422],"elapsed":32.724230493,"_type":"aimessage"}]
