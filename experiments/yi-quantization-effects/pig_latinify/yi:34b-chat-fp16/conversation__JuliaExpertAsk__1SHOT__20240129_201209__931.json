Each thread will process one string at a time, converting it to Pig Latin and printing the result. The `split` function is used to split the text into words, and then each word is translated according to the rules of Pig Latin (moving the first letter to the end and adding \"ay\"). The resulting string is printed with leading whitespace removed using `replace`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,300],"elapsed":23.303411755,"_type":"aimessage"}]
