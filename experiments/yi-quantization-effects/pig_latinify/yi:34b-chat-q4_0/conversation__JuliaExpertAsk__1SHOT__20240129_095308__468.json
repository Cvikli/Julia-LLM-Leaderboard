You would need to implement the `pig_latinify_string` function to actually translate each string into Pig Latin. The `pig_latinify` function creates a threadpool and submits jobs to it, with each job translating a single string in parallel.","status":200,"tokens":[0,299],"elapsed":8.052931591,"_type":"aimessage"}]
