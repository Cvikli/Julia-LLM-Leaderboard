It uses the `Threads.@spawn` macro to spawn a new thread for each element in the `input_strings` vector, and it defines a `pig_latinize` function that actually performs the transformation from a string into its pig latin equivalent.\n\nThe `pig_latinize` function accounts for whether the first character of the string is a vowel or not to determine how to move the first part of the word to the end in Pig Latin. If it's not a vowel, we move that initial consonant (or set of consonants) to the end and add \"ay\"; if it is a vowel, we add \"way\" to the end instead.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you are using Julia 1.6 or later, as the `Threads` module was introduced in that version. Also, the `pig_latinify` function does not use the `@threads` macro directly because it is designed to work on arrays and we're iterating over a vector here. Instead, we use `Threads.@spawn` within the loop.","status":200,"tokens":[0,746],"elapsed":19.91370315,"_type":"aimessage"}]
