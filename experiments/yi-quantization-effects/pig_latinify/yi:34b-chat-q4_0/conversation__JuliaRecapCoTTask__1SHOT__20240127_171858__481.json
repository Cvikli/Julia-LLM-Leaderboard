[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses the `@threads` macro to parallelize the translation process across multiple threads, ensuring that each word is translated in its own thread. The `translate_to_pig_latin` function defines the rules for translating individual words from English to Pig Latin.\n\nPlease note that Julia's multithreading capabilities are typically used for compute-intensive tasks, and this example may not fully utilize multiple cores due to the small amount of work per thread. However, it demonstrates the use of `@threads` for parallel processing in a simple case.\n\nIf you provide the special instructions, I can modify the solution to meet any additional requirements or constraints.","status":200,"tokens":[0,548],"elapsed":14.781545315,"_type":"aimessage"}]
