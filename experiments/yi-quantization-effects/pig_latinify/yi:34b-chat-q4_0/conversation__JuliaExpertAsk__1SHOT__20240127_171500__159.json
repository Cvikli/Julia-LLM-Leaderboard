The work is divided into chunks, with each chunk processed by a separate thread using `@async` and `@sync` to ensure synchronization.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_threadsafe` function is used within `pig_latinify` to actually translate the words to Pig Latin. It uses a lock on the word itself to ensure that the operation is thread-safe, as each word is modified and then appended to the result vector.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you are using at least Julia 1.3, which introduced the `@sync` macro.","status":200,"tokens":[0,450],"elapsed":11.946081185,"_type":"aimessage"}]
