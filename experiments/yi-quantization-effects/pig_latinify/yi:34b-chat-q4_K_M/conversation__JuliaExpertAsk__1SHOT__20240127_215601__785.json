It creates a separate thread for each word using the `Threads.@spawn` macro and then waits for all threads to finish before collecting the results. The actual translation logic to Pig Latin is implemented in the `transform_to_pig_latin` function, which searches for the first vowel and strips the leading characters up to that point to form a \"vowel-less\" word. It then appends \"ay\" to create the Pig Latin version of the word.\n\nPlease note that this is a simplified example and does not include error handling or edge case handling. In practice, you would want to ensure that your threads are safe from race conditions and that your code can handle words with multiple vowels, punctuation, numbers, and special characters. Additionally, you might want to consider using `@threads` instead of manually creating threads for better performance.","status":200,"tokens":[0,464],"elapsed":13.188097685,"_type":"aimessage"}]
