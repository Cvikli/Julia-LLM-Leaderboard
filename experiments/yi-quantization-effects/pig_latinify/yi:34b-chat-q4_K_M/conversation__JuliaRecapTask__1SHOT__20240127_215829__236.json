Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It also ensures that words starting with vowels are not modified and handles cases where a word begins with a number or a single consonant at the beginning of the text (e.g., \"cat\" becomes \"at catay\").","status":200,"tokens":[0,613],"elapsed":17.71522149,"_type":"aimessage"}]
