Each thread works on one element of the vector, converting it to Pig Latin using the `pig_latinize` utility function. The `pig_latinize` function itself is quite simple and returns the original string with the first letter appended at the end followed by \"ay\". If the word starts with a vowel, no letters are prepended, and if the word is only one character long (a single vowel), then \"way\" is appended instead of \"ay\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,294],"elapsed":8.313500419,"_type":"aimessage"}]
