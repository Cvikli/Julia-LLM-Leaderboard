Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    # We will use a shared array to store the results since we are working with mutable objects\n    results = SharedArray{String}(undef, length(strings))\n\n    # Create a thread pool with as many threads as there are CPUs\n    nthreads = Threads.nthreads()\n    threads = [Threads.@spawn pig_latinify_threaded(string, results) for string in strings]\n\n    # Wait for all threads to finish and collect the results\n    for thread in threads\n        fetch(thread)\n    end\n\n    return Array(results)\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_threaded(string::String, results::SharedArray{String})\n    # Convert the string to pig latin\n    pig_latin_word = \"\"\n    if !isempty(string) && (first(string) == 'a' || first(string) == 'e' || first(string) == 'i' || first(string) == 'o' || first(string) == 'u')\n        pig_latin_word = string[2:end] * \"ay\"\n    else\n        pig_latin_word = string * \"way\"\n    end\n\n    # Store the result in the shared array\n    results[Threads.threadid() + 1] = pig_latin_word\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nstrings = [\"Hello\", \"World\", \"PigLatin\"]\npig_latinified_strings = pig_latinify(strings)\n```\n\nIn the `pig_latinify` function, we create a shared array to store the results. We then create a thread pool using `nthreads` from the `Threads` module and spawn tasks for each string in the vector. The `pig_latinify_threaded` function is run on each thread, where it converts the string to pig latin and stores the result in the shared array.\n\nPlease note that using threads with mutable objects like strings can be tricky, especially when it comes to synchronization and race conditions. In this example, we're assuming that the `pig_latinify_threaded` function is fast enough that no two threads will try to write to the shared array at the same time. If you encounter issues with this code, consider using more sophisticated synchronization mechanisms or task-based parallelism instead of threading.","status":200,"tokens":[0,607],"elapsed":17.287599993,"_type":"aimessage"}]
