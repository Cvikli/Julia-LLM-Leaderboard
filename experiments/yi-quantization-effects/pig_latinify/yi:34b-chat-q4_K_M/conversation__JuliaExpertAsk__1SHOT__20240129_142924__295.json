It uses the `@threads` macro to run each iteration of the loop on a separate thread. The `pig_latinize` function is used within the `@threads` block to convert each string in the vector to Pig Latin.\n\nThe `is_vowel_sound` function is used to determine if the first character of a string is a vowel sound, including 'y' as a vowel at the start of a word. The `pig_latinize` function then uses this logic to convert the string to Pig Latin by appending \"-ay\" to the end of the string, moving the first letter (or \"y\" acting as a vowel) to the end if it's not a vowel sound, and then concatenating the moved letter with \"-ay\".\n\nPlease note that `@threads` is used here without any additional synchronization mechanisms. This means that the threads may write to the vector `strs` simultaneously, which could lead to race conditions and unpredictable results if the strings are modified in place. If you need to ensure thread safety, you should use more sophisticated synchronization primitives or modify the code to avoid shared mutable state.","status":200,"tokens":[0,533],"elapsed":15.486489788,"_type":"aimessage"}]
