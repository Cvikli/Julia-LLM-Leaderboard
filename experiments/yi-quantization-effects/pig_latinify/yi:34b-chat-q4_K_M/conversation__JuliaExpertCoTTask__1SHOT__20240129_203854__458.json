For example, \"hello\" becomes \"ello-hay\".\n   - Since each iteration should run on a separate thread, I will use `ThreadPool` from the `Base.Threading` module to parallelize the transformation process.\n   - I will create a function that takes a string and transforms it into pig latin. Then, I will use `map` with `Threads.@spawn` to apply this function to each element of the vector in parallel.\n\n2. **Write any functions and other code you need:**\n   ```julia\n   function pig_latinify(text)\n       return replace(replace(text, r\"^(\\w)(\\w*)|\\s+\" => s\"\\1ay \\2\"), \" \" => \"-\")\n   end\n   ```\n   This function uses regular expressions to match the first letter and the rest of the word. It then replaces these matches with the pig latin transformation. The space characters are also replaced with dashes to make the output more readable.\n\n3. **Solve the task:**\n   ```julia\n   function pig_latinify_parallel(words)\n       tasks = map(Threads.@spawn -> pig_latinify(word), words)\n       return [fetch(task) for task in tasks]\n   end\n   ```\n   This function uses `map` with `Threads.@spawn` to apply the `pig_latinify` function to each word in parallel. The results are collected using `fetch` and stored in a vector.\n\n4. **Check that your solution is correct:**\n   - I will test the functions with some sample data:\n     ```julia\n     words = [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]\n     pig_latinify_parallel(words) # should return [\"ello-hay\", \"pple-ay\", \"rong-stray\", \"orld-way\"]\n     ```\n\nHere is the complete code:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threading\nusing Test\n\nfunction pig_latinify(text)\n    return replace(replace(text, r\"^(\\w)(\\w*)|\\s+\" => s\"\\1ay \\2\"), \" \" => \"-\")\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_parallel(words)\n    tasks = map(Threads.@spawn -> pig_latinify(word), words)\n    return [fetch(task) for task in tasks]\nend\n\n# Test the functions\nwords = [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]\nresult = pig_latinify_parallel(words)\n@test result == [\"ello-hay\", \"pple-ay\", \"rong-stray\", \"orld-way\"]\n```\n\nThis code defines the `pig_latinify` function to transform a single string into pig latin and `pig_latinify_parallel` to do this in parallel for a vector of strings. It then tests the functions with the provided sample data.","status":200,"tokens":[0,758],"elapsed":22.301376541,"_type":"aimessage"}]
