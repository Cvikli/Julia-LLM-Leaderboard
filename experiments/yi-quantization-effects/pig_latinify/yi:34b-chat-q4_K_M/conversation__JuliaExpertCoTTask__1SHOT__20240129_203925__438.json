Here are a few examples:\n\n```julia\nusing Test\n\n@testset \"Pig Latin Transformation\" begin\n    @test pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]) == [\"ellohay\", \"pplehay\", \"tronghay\", \"orldway\"]\n    @test pig_latinify([\"dog\", \"cat\", \"mouse\"]) == [\"ogday\", \"atcay\", \"mouseday\"]\n    @test pig_latinify([\"\", \"fish\"]) == [\"\", \"fishyay\"]\nend\n```\n\nThese tests should pass if the `pig_latinify` function is working correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,574],"elapsed":16.812417451,"_type":"aimessage"}]
