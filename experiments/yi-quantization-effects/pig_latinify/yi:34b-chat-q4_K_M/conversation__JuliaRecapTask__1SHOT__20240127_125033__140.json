[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It first defines the number of threads available with `Threads.nthreads()` and then creates a vector of the same length as `strs` to hold the transformed strings. The actual transformation logic is encapsulated within the `@threads` block, where each thread operates on one element of the `strs` vector.\n\nThe pig latin transformation itself is a simple rule-based translation:\n\n1. If the string starts with a vowel sound (\"aeiouy\"), add \"way\" to the end of the word.\n2. If the string does not start with a vowel sound, move the first letter to the end and add \"ay\".\n\nNote that this function assumes that the input strings are valid English words. It also does not handle punctuation or multi-word strings.","status":200,"tokens":[377,383],"elapsed":11.228916853,"_type":"aimessage"}]
