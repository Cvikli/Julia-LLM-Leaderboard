Each thread will process one string at a time, transforming it into Pig Latin and storing the result back into the output vector. Note that this example assumes a simple transformation rule for Pig Latin and does not handle edge cases or non-English characters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,357],"elapsed":10.318844923,"_type":"aimessage"}]
