Define a function `pig_latinify` that takes a vector of strings as input.\n2. Inside the function, create a list of threads, each thread responsible for translating one word in the vector.\n3. Wait for all threads to finish and return the translated words as a vector.\n4. Check that the output is correct by comparing it with the expected result.\n\n# Code\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    nthreads = Threads.nthreads()\n    tasks = Vector{Future}()\n    for i in 1:length(words)\n        word = words[i]\n        if word == \"\" || occursin(\" \", word)\n            # Handle edge cases where the word is empty or contains spaces\n            push!(tasks, Future(()->(word)))\n        else\n            # Translate each word to pig latin\n            pig_latin = \"$word-ay\"\n            push!(tasks, Future(()->(pig_latin)))\n        end\n    end\n    # Wait for all threads to finish and collect the results\n    results = Vector{String}()\n    for task in tasks\n        result = fetch(task)\n        if isa(result, Exception)\n            println(\"Error occurred: \", result)\n        else\n            push!(results, String(result))\n        end\n    end\n    return results\nend\n```\n\n# Solution\n\n```julia\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\n```\n\n# Check Correctness\n\nThe expected result for the given input is:\n```\n[\"hello-ay\", \"apple-ay\", \"strong-ay\", \"world-ay\"]\n```\n\nSince we're using `Future` objects to handle asynchronous tasks, we need to fetch the results from each thread. The `fetch` function will block until the computation is complete and return the result or an error if one occurred. We then collect these results into a vector and return it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,470],"elapsed":13.714115369,"_type":"aimessage"}]
