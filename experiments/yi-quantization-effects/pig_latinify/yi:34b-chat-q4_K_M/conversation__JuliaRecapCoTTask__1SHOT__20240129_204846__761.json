[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses the `@threads` macro to parallelize the transformation over each word in the vector using separate threads. The `pig_latin` function is used to transform each word into its pig latin equivalent.\n\nPlease note that the `@threads` macro should be used with caution, as it can lead to race conditions and other issues if not used properly. In this simple example, since we are only printing the results, there is no risk of data races. However, if you were to modify a shared collection or variable within the threads, you would need to use locks or other synchronization mechanisms to ensure thread safety.\n\nAlso, the `pig_latin` function assumes that words start with consonants and handles vowels at the beginning of the word by appending \"way\". This is a simple implementation of the pig latin transformation and may not cover all edge cases (e.g., handling of non-English characters or words that start with a silent consonant).\n\nTo use this function, simply call `pig_latinify(your_words)` where `your_words` is a vector of strings you want to convert to pig latin.","status":200,"tokens":[0,454],"elapsed":13.400114377,"_type":"aimessage"}]
