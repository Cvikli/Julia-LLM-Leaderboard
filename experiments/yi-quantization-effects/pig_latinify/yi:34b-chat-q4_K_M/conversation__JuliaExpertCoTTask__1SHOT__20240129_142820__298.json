The `pig_latinify` function then uses this helper function within threads and collects the results after all threads have finished execution.\n\nTo test the function, we can use the provided vector of strings:\n\n```julia\n# Test the function with the provided data\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]) == [\"hellogay\", \"appleway\", \"strongway\", \"worldway\"]\n```\n\nThis should return `true` if the conversion is correct.","status":200,"tokens":[0,634],"elapsed":18.55533479,"_type":"aimessage"}]
