It uses the `@threads` macro from the Base module to parallelize the processing of each string in the vector across multiple threads. The `process_pig_latin` function is used to convert a single string into its pig latin equivalent.","status":200,"tokens":[0,265],"elapsed":7.644384839,"_type":"aimessage"}]
