[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

If the word is empty or starts with a vowel, it simply appends \"ay\" to the word. Otherwise, it separates the first syllable (consisting of the first letter) from the rest of the word and concatenates them in reverse order.\n\nWe then define `pig_latinify` which operates on a vector of strings. It uses `@threads` macro to run the translation for each string in parallel. The `@spawn` function is used within the `@threads` block to spawn new threads for each element of the input vector. The `wait` function is used to wait for all spawned threads to finish before returning the output vector.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you are using at least Julia 1.5, which introduced the `@spawn` and `wait` functions for managing asynchronous tasks in a more elegant way than the older `Future` objects.","status":200,"tokens":[0,456],"elapsed":13.152211747,"_type":"aimessage"}]
