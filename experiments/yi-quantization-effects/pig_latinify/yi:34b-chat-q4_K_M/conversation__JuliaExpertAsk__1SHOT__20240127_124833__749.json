It uses Julia's built-in multithreading capabilities to run the transformation for each string on a separate thread using the `@threads` macro. The `pig_latinize` and `pig_latinize_word` functions are helper functions used within `pig_latinify` to convert individual strings and words, respectively, to Pig Latin. The code also includes a check for irregular English verbs and nouns that do not follow the standard rule for converting to Pig Latin (appending \"ay\").","status":200,"tokens":[0,551],"elapsed":15.688078547,"_type":"aimessage"}]
