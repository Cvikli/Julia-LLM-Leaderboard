[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses the `@spawn` macro from Base to spawn a new thread for each word in the vector. The `piglatinify` function itself is a separate function that takes a single string and returns its pig latin translation.\n\nThe `piglatinify` function works by checking if the first character of the word is a vowel (using a regular expression). If it's not, it appends \"ay\" to the end; otherwise, it leaves that part empty. It then adds an 's' and reverses all characters except for the last one (which is already in its correct position).\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you are working with a Unix-like system (Linux or macOS) where threads can be created using `@spawn` without additional packages. If you need to run this on Windows, you would need to use a different approach or install the `Threads` package.","status":200,"tokens":[0,444],"elapsed":12.815299601,"_type":"aimessage"}]
