[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Base: @threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    @threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        word = words[i]\n        if word == \"\" || occursin(\" \", word)\n            # Handle empty strings and those with spaces\n            continue\n        end\n        vowel_ind = findfirst(c -> c in 'aeiouy', word)\n        if isnothing(vowel_ind)\n            # No vowel found, not a valid English word\n            continue\n        end\n        new_word = replace(word, first(word)[1] => \"\") * \"ay\"\n        words[i] = new_word\n    end\n    return words\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `@threads` macro to parallelize the transformation of each word in a vector of strings into Pig Latin. The loop is threaded, but care is taken to ensure that empty strings and those with spaces are skipped, as they do not conform to the rules of Pig Latin. Additionally, words without a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, or y) are also skipped, as they cannot be transformed into Pig Latin.\n\nThe `findfirst` function is used to locate the index of the first vowel in the word. If no vowel is found, the word is considered not a valid English word and is skipped. Otherwise, the first letter is removed from the word and \"ay\" is appended to create the Pig Latin version.\n\nThe `replace` function is used to replace the first character of the word with an empty string, effectively removing it. This is necessary because in Pig Latin, the first consonant (or consonant cluster) of the word is moved to the end and \"ay\" is appended.\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes that all strings are valid English words and that there are no non-alphabetic characters in the input. If these conditions are not met, the function may produce unexpected results or errors.","status":200,"tokens":[0,449],"elapsed":13.210615586,"_type":"aimessage"}]
