It uses the `@threads` macro to parallelize the iteration over each string in the vector, running each iteration on a separate thread from the Threads pool. The `Threads` module is imported for this purpose.\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function does not actually perform the translation to Pig Latin; it just schedules the work to be done by the threads. The actual translation is done in the `pig_latinize` helper function, which is called within each threaded iteration of `pig_latinify`.\n\nThe `pig_latinize` function checks if the first character of the string is a vowel (using a predefined array of vowels) and handles the Pig Latin transformation accordingly. If the first character is not a vowel, it moves the first character to the end of the word and adds \"ay\" at the end. If the first character is a vowel, it simply appends \"-way\" to the string.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you are using a recent version of Julia (1.6 or later) that supports the `@threads` macro for parallel execution.","status":200,"tokens":[0,443],"elapsed":12.892324955,"_type":"aimessage"}]
