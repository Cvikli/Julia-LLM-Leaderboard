[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It iterates over the vector using a threaded loop, and for each word, it checks if the first letter is a letter (using the `isalpha` function). If yes, it constructs the pig latin form by appending \"ay\" to the rest of the word, excluding the first letter. If not, it leaves the word unchanged.\n\nThe `pig_latin_words` vector is pre-allocated with the same length as the input `words` vector to ensure efficient memory usage. The resulting pig latin words are stored in this vector and returned at the end of the function.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes a 1-based indexing for the strings in the vector, which is consistent with the provided guidelines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,340],"elapsed":9.976248666,"_type":"aimessage"}]
