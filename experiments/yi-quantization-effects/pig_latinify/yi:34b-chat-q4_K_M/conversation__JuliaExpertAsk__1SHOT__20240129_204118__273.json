Each thread is responsible for transforming one string in the vector according to the Pig Latin rules. The `strip` function is used to remove leading and trailing whitespace from each text, as this can affect the transformation. The regular expressions are used to identify vowels and consonants at the beginning of a word.","status":200,"tokens":[0,446],"elapsed":12.952243602,"_type":"aimessage"}]
