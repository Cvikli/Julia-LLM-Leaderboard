[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Base: tail, iterate\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    nthreads = nprocs()\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    @threads for (i, word) in enumerate(words)\n        vowels = 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'\n        first_vowel_idx = findfirst(c -> c in vowels, word)\n        if first_vowel_idx !== nothing\n            result[i] = string(word[first_vowel_idx:end], word[1:(first_vowel_idx - 1)], \"ay\")\n        else\n            result[i] = string(word, \"way\")\n        end\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses `@threads` to parallelize the transformation of each word in the vector. It searches for the first vowel in each word and then constructs the pig latin equivalent using that position. If no vowel is found, it appends \"way\" to the original word. The result is stored in a new vector.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes all words will fit within the memory of a single machine. If you need to handle very large datasets or if the dataset does not fit in memory, you might want to consider using a distributed computing framework like Dask or Ray.","status":200,"tokens":[0,324],"elapsed":9.537155619,"_type":"aimessage"}]
