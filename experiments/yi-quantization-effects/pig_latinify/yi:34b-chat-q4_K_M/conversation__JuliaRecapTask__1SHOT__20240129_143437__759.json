[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It iterates over each word, checks if the first letter is a letter (using the `isalpha` function), and then constructs the pig latin equivalent by appending \"ay\" to the rest of the word after dropping the first letter. If the first character is not a letter, it simply returns the original word.\n\nThe `pig_latin_words` vector is pre-allocated with `undef` to ensure that each element has the correct type and size before being filled in by the threads. This is important for performance when using `@threads`.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the input strings are valid English words, as it does not perform any additional checks or handling of non-letter characters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,336],"elapsed":9.860831029,"_type":"aimessage"}]
