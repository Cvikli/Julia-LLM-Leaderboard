[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The function uses `@threads` to parallelize the transformation across multiple threads. It also includes a helper function `pig_latinify_chunk` to process each chunk of texts in parallel.\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function works as follows:\n\n1. It calculates the number of threads available and the chunksize, which is the number of elements each thread will process.\n2. It uses `@threads` to iterate over the vector of strings, with each iteration running on a separate thread.\n3. Within each thread, it processes a chunk of texts by removing the first letter from each string and appending \"ay\" to the end. If the string is empty, it returns an empty string.\n4. The results are collected into a vector and returned as the output.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_chunk` function works as follows:\n\n1. It creates an empty vector of strings to hold the Pig Latin versions of each input text.\n2. For each text in the chunk, it determines if the text is empty; if so, it adds an empty string to the output vector.\n3. If the text is not empty, it removes the first letter and appends \"ay\" to the end, creating the Pig Latin version of the word.\n4. The resulting strings are added to the output vector.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you have a recent enough Julia version that supports `@threads`. If you're using an older version, you may need to use `Threads.@spawn` and `fetch` instead.","status":200,"tokens":[0,736],"elapsed":21.709142982,"_type":"aimessage"}]
