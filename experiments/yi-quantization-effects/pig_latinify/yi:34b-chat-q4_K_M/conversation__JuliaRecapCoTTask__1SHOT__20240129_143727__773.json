[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses thread-based parallelism to process the strings in chunks, with each chunk being processed by a separate thread. The `pig_latinify_chunk` function is used to convert a chunk of strings into their pig latin equivalents and then combines the results back into a single vector.\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function divides the input texts into chunks based on the number of threads available and then uses `Threads.@threads` to parallelize the processing of these chunks. Each thread processes its own chunk and stores the results in a local array, which is then combined with the overall result vector after all threads have completed their work.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_chunk` function handles the actual transformation of each string into pig latin. It strips any leading whitespace from the rest of the word (everything but the first letter) and then concatenates the first letter, the rest of the word, and \"ay\" to form the pig latin version of the word.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you are using a recent version of Julia (1.6 or later) that supports thread-based parallelism with `Threads.@threads`. If you are using an older version of Julia, you may need to use different parallelization techniques, such as task-based parallelism with `@async` and `wait`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,644],"elapsed":18.997689504,"_type":"aimessage"}]
