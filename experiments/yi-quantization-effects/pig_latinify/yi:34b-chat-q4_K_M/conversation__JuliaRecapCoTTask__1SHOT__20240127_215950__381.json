[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The function creates a vector of threads, each thread responsible for translating one word from the input vector into Pig Latin. After all threads have completed their work, the output vector is returned.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_word` function determines whether a word begins with a vowel sound (based on a set of common vowels) and applies the appropriate transformation rule for Pig Latin conversion. If the word starts with a vowel sound, we add \"way\" to the end of the word; otherwise, we concatenate the second half of the word followed by the first letter and then \"ay\".\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes the use of Julia's standard library for threading (`Threads`). It is important to ensure that your Julia environment is set up with the necessary packages to support multithreading before running this code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,435],"elapsed":12.535071705,"_type":"aimessage"}]
