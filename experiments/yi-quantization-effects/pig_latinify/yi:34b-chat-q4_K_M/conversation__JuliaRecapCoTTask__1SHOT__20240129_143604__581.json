[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses the `@threads` macro to parallelize the transformation across multiple threads. The `pig_latin` function itself handles the actual conversion of a single word to pig latin, following these rules:\n\n1. If the first letter is 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u', the word is suffixed with 'way'.\n2. Otherwise, the rest of the word (everything but the first letter) is taken and suffixed with 'ay'.\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function assumes that the input words do not already contain non-standard characters (like apostrophes or hyphens) that would need to be handled for a strict pig latin translation. If such characters are present, they should be removed or accounted for before applying this transformation.\n\nPlease note that this code does not include any error checking or handling of edge cases. It is designed to work with a simple list of words where each word starts with a single letter and does not contain punctuation.","status":200,"tokens":[0,464],"elapsed":13.653750197,"_type":"aimessage"}]
