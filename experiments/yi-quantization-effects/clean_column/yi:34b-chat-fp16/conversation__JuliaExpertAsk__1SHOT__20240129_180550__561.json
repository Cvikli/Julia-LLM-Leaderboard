The entire string is lowercased using `lowercase()`.\n2. Leading and trailing whitespaces are stripped using `strip(col)`.\n3. Spaces and hyphens within the string are replaced with underscores using `replace(' ', '_')` and `replace('-', '_')`, respectively.\n\nThe pipe operator (`|>`) is used to chain these functions together, which is a concise way of writing multiple operations on a value in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[0,165],"elapsed":12.799210077,"_type":"aimessage"}]
