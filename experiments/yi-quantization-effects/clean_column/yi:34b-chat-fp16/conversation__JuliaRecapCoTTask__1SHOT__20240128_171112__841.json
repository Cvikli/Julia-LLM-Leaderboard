[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Given the special instructions provided:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    return lowercase(strip(col)) |> replace => '-' => '_'\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a pipeline operator to chain several operations on the column name. It first lowercases and strips leading and trailing whitespaces using `lowercase` and `strip` functions, respectively. Then, it replaces all hyphens with underscores using the `replace` function with a custom substitution rule.\n\nThe `|>` operator is used to compose functions, where the result of each operation is passed as the first argument to the next function in the pipeline. The `replace => '-' => '_'` syntax is a convenient way to define a substitution rule without using a lambda or anonymous function.\n\nPlease note that if you are using an older version of Julia, you might need to install the `StringInterpolation` package to use the `|>` operator. If this is not possible due to the \"prefer Julia standard libraries\" guideline, you can rewrite the function without using `|>` as follows:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    return lowercase(strip(col))\nend\n\nclean_column(col) = replace(col, '-' => '_')\n```\n\nThis version separates the pipeline into two functions for clarity and adheres to the guidelines by avoiding any packages.","status":200,"tokens":[0,308],"elapsed":24.019790126,"_type":"aimessage"}]
