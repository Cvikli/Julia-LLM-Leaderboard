[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Given the task description and the special instructions provided, here is a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name as specified:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    return lowercase(strip(col)) |> replace => \"-\" => \"_\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes an `AbstractString` representing a column name and returns the cleaned version of the string. It first uses `lowercase` to convert the string to lowercase, then `strip` to remove any leading or trailing whitespaces. Finally, it uses `replace` with a lambda expression as its first argument to replace all hyphens (`-`) with underscores (`_`).\n\nPlease note that in the provided code, there is a syntax error where the pipe character (`|>`) is used without proper arguments. The correct usage would be:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    return lowercase(strip(col)) |> replace(\"-\" => \"_\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function adheres to the guidelines provided, using standard Julia syntax and libraries for efficiency and clarity. It does not use any new packages and is designed to handle strings of various types that implement the `AbstractString` interface.","status":200,"tokens":[0,275],"elapsed":21.44762052,"_type":"aimessage"}]
