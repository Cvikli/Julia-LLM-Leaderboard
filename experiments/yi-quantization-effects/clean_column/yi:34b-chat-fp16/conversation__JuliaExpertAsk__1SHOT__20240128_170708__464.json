The entire string is lowercased using the `lowercase()` function.\n2. Leading and trailing whitespaces are stripped using the `strip()` function.\n3. Spaces and hyphens are replaced with underscores by concatenating an underscore to the end of the string.\n\nPlease note that this function does not perform any error checking or handling of special characters other than spaces and hyphens.
