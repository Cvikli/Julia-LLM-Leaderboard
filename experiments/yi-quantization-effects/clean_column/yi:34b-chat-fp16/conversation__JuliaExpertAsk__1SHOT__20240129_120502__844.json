It is lowercased using `lowercase()`.\n2. Leading and trailing whitespaces are stripped using `strip()`.\n3. Any spaces or hyphens within the string are replaced with an underscore using `replace(..., r\"\\s|-\" => \"_\")`. The regular expression `r\"\\s|-\"` matches any whitespace character (`' '`) or hyphen (`'-'`).\n\nThe function is designed to be used on a single column name at a time and will ensure that the resulting string is clean and ready for use in a Julia program, especially when dealing with data processing or manipulation where consistent naming conventions are important.","status":200,"tokens":[0,209],"elapsed":16.197778643,"_type":"aimessage"}]
