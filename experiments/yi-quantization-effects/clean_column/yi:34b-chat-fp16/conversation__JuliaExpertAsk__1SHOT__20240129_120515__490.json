The string is stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace using `strip()`.\n2. All characters are converted to lowercase using `lowercase()`.\n3. Spaces (`' '`) and hyphens (`'-'`) are replaced with underscores (`'_'`) using `replace()`.\n\nPlease note that in Julia, strings are immutable, so this function returns a new string rather than modifying the original input.","status":200,"tokens":[0,159],"elapsed":12.315167694,"_type":"aimessage"}]
