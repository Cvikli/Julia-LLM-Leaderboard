[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Given the special instructions are empty, I will proceed with the default task description.\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    return lowercase(replace(strip(col), [\" \", \"-\"] => \"_\"))\nend\n```\n\nThis function `clean_column` takes a string (`col`) and returns a new string with the following modifications:\n\n1. The input string is lowercased using `lowercase()`.\n2. Any leading or trailing whitespaces are stripped using `strip(col)`.\n3. Spaces and hyphens within the string are replaced with underscores using `replace(..., [\" \", \"-\"] => \"_\")`.\n\nThe function is generic enough to work with any abstract type of strings (`AbstractString`), which is in line with the provided guidelines. It uses standard Julia libraries and functions without importing additional packages.","status":200,"tokens":[0,203],"elapsed":15.808723167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
