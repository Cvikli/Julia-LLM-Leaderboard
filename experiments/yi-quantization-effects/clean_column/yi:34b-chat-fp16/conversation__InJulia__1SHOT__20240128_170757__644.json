The `lower` function lowercases the string, `strip` removes leading and trailing whitespaces, and `replace` is used to replace spaces and hyphens with underscores using a regular expression.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\njulia> clean_column(\"My Column\")\n\"my_column\"\n```\n\nNote that the `clean_column` function does not handle edge cases such as special characters other than spaces and hyphens, nor does it ensure that the resulting name conforms to any specific naming conventions for column names in a particular context (e.g., SQL, CSV files, etc.). If you need to account for additional cases or have specific requirements, you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,291],"elapsed":22.539423759,"_type":"aimessage"}]
