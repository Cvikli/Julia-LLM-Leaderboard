This is to ensure that the resulting name has an underscore followed by \"column\" since your example transformation from \"My Column\" to \"my_column\" implies this additional step.\n\nIf you have a vector of strings representing column names, you can apply this function element-wise using broadcasting:\n\n```julia\ncolumn_names = [\"My Column\", \"His Column\", \"Her Column\"]\ncleaned_names = clean_column.(column_names)\nprintln(cleaned_names)  # Output will be a vector of cleaned names\n```\n\nThe `.(` syntax is used to apply the function `clean_column` to each element of the `column_names` vector, and the resulting vector of strings is stored in `cleaned_names`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,308],"elapsed":11.417438941,"_type":"aimessage"}]
