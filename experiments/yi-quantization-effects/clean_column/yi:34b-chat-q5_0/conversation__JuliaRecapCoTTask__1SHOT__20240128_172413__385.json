[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    # Lowercase the column name\n    lc_col = lowercase(col)\n    \n    # Strip leading and trailing whitespaces\n    trimmed_col = strip(lc_col)\n    \n    # Replace spaces and hyphens with underscore\n    cleaned_col = replace(trimmed_col, r\"\\s|-\" => \"_\")\n    \n    return cleaned_col\nend\n```\n\nThis function `clean_column` takes a string `col` representing a column name as input. It first lowercases the string, then strips any leading and trailing whitespaces using the built-in `strip` function. Finally, it replaces all spaces and hyphens with underscores using `replace` with a regular expression pattern. The resulting string is returned.\n\n# Double-check\n\nThe function adheres to the provided guidelines:\n\n- It uses standard Julia syntax and functions.\n- It does not rely on any external packages, as none are necessary for this simple task.\n- Type annotations are general enough to accommodate different types of strings (`AbstractString`).\n- Performance is optimized by using built-in string manipulation functions like `lowercase`, `strip`, and `replace`.\n- Clarity is maintained through readable code that performs each step in a logical sequence.\n- The function is generic enough to work with any kind of string without being too restrictive.\n\nThe function is consistent with the instructions provided: it lowercases the column name, strips whitespaces, and replaces spaces and hyphens with underscores.","status":200,"tokens":[0,350],"elapsed":11.278122482,"_type":"aimessage"}]
