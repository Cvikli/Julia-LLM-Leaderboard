[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    return lowercase(strip(col)) |> replace => \"-\" => \"_\"\nend\n\n# Example usage:\noriginal_column = \"My Column\"\ncleaned_column = clean_column(original_column)\nprintln(\"Original column name: $original_column\")\nprintln(\"Cleaned column name: $cleaned_column\")\n```\n\nThis function uses pipe-forward (|> ) operator to chain the string manipulation operations. First, it lowers the case using `lowercase()`, then strips any leading and trailing whitespaces with `strip()`. Finally, it replaces all hyphens with underscores using `replace(col, \"-\" => \"_\")`.\n\nPlease note that the `replace` function in Julia 1.0 and later returns a lazy sequence, so we use the `|>` operator to chain the operations without explicitly creating a temporary variable. If you need a concrete vector or string as output, you would need to collect the result:\n\n```julia\ncleaned_column = String(collect(replace(col, \"-\" => \"_\")))\n```\n\nHowever, if you are using Julia 1.0 or later, this is not necessary since the `replace` function returns a string by default.","status":200,"tokens":[11,288],"elapsed":9.316372909,"_type":"aimessage"}]
