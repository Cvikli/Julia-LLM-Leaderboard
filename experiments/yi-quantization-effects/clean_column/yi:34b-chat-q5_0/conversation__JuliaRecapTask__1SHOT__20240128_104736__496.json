[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    # Lowercase the string\n    lc_col = lowercase(col)\n    \n    # Strip leading and trailing whitespaces\n    stripped_col = strip(lc_col)\n    \n    # Replace spaces and hyphens with underscores\n    cleaned_col = replace(stripped_col, r\"\\s|-\" => \"_\")\n    \n    return cleaned_col\nend\n```\n\nThis function `clean_column` takes a string `col` representing a column name and returns a new string with the following modifications:\n\n1. The string is lowercased using `lowercase()`.\n2. Any leading or trailing whitespaces are stripped off using `strip()`.\n3. Spaces and hyphens within the string are replaced with underscores using `replace()` and a regular expression.\n\nThe function is written to be type-stable by using `AbstractString` as the input type, which is the Julia base type for strings. This ensures that the function can work with any kind of string without sacrificing performance.","status":200,"tokens":[0,241],"elapsed":7.750147836,"_type":"aimessage"}]
