Lowercases the string using `lowercase()`.\n2. Strips leading and trailing whitespaces using `strip()`.\n3. Replaces any spaces and hyphens with an underscore using `replace(::String, '-' => '_')` which is a Julia function that takes a regular expression as its first argument and a replacement string as its second argument.\n\nThe `|>` operator is used to chain the functions together, ensuring that each operation is performed sequentially on the input string.","status":200,"tokens":[105,161],"elapsed":7.378261786,"_type":"aimessage"}]
