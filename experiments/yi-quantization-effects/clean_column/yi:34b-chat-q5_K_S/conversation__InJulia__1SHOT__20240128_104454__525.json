Below is a simple function that does the following:\n\n1. Lowercases the string.\n2. Strips leading and trailing whitespace using `strip`.\n3. Replaces spaces and hyphens with underscores using `replace`.\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col)\n    return lowercase(strip(replace(col, [' ' => '_', '-' => '_'])))\nend\n```\n\nHere's how you can use the function:\n\n```julia\njulia> col = \"My Column\"\n\"My Column\"\n\njulia> clean_column(col)\n\"my_column\"\n```\n\nThis function is relatively efficient because it uses string manipulation functions that are optimized in Julia. If you have a large dataset with many columns, this function will help ensure that your column names are consistent and easy to work with.","status":200,"tokens":[0,208],"elapsed":6.580039948,"_type":"aimessage"}]
