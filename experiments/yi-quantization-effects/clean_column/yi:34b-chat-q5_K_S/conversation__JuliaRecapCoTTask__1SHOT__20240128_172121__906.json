[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Given that there are no special instructions provided, I will proceed to solve the task using the given steps and Julia language features.\n\n```julia\n# Recall useful Julia snippets\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    return strip(lowercase(col)) |> replace => \"-\" => \"_\"\nend\n\n# Test the function\ncol_name = \"My Column\"\ncleaned_name = clean_column(col_name)\n@assert cleaned_name == \"my_column\"\n```\n\nIn this solution, I've used `strip` to remove leading and trailing whitespaces, `lowercase` to convert the string to lowercase, and then `replace` with a regular expression substitution to replace hyphens with underscores. The pipe operator (`|>`) is used to chain these functions together.\n\nFinally, I've added a test using an assertion to verify that the function works as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[0,202],"elapsed":6.487488497,"_type":"aimessage"}]
