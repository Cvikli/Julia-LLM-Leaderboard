It first lowercases the string, then strips any leading or trailing whitespace using `strip()`, which is a standard Julia function that removes both leading and trailing whitespace from its argument. Finally, it replaces any spaces and hyphens with an underscore using `replace(col, '-' => '_')`. The `*` operator is used to concatenate the strings without whitespace between them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,177],"elapsed":4.524318555,"_type":"aimessage"}]
