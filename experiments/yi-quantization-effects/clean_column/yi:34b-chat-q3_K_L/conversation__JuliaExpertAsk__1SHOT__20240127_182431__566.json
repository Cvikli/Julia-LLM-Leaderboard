Then it replaces hyphens with underscores. Finally, it replaces all sequences of one or more whitespace characters with a single underscore. This ensures that the column name is converted to a standardized format with only lowercase letters and underscores.","status":200,"tokens":[105,119],"elapsed":3.428814216,"_type":"aimessage"}]
