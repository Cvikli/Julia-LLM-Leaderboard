The `lowercase` function converts the string to lowercase, while `strip` removes leading and trailing whitespaces. The second argument to `strip` specifies that any hyphens (`-`) should be converted to underscores (`_`), but only when they are not followed by another underscore.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\njulia> clean_column(\"My Column\")\n\"my_column\"\n\njulia> clean_column(\"my column\")\n\"my_column\"\n\njulia> clean_column(\"my-column\")\n\"my_column\"\n```\n\nThis function is designed to be used with column names that may have mixed cases, leading or trailing whitespaces, or hyphens. It ensures that the resulting name is consistent and easier to work with in a case where you want to use these columns as keys in a data structure or for further processing.","status":200,"tokens":[0,281],"elapsed":7.457675391,"_type":"aimessage"}]
