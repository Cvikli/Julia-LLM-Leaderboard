The `strip()` function is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespaces, `lowercase()` is used to convert the string to lowercase, and then we replace any spaces (`' '`) and hyphens (`'-'`) with an underscore (`'_'`) using string concatenation. The `* '_'` at the end ensures that an underscore is appended if there isn't one already.","status":200,"tokens":[0,152],"elapsed":4.002641957,"_type":"aimessage"}]
