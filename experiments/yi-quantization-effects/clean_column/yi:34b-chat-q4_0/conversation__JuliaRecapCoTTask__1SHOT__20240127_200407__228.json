[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    return replace(lowercase(strip(col)), r\"[- ]\" => \"_\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `lowercase` and `strip` functions to lowercase the string and strip leading and trailing whitespaces. Then it uses `replace` with a regular expression to replace all occurrences of '-' and spaces with an underscore. The regular expression `r\"[- ]\"` matches both hyphens and spaces.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this task:\n   - Use the `lowercase` function to lowercase the string.\n   - Use the `strip` function to remove leading and trailing whitespace.\n   - Use the `replace` function with a regular expression to replace unwanted characters.\n\n2. Solve the task:\n   - Define the `clean_column` function that takes an `AbstractString` as input.\n   - Apply the necessary transformations in the order of lowercasing, stripping whitespace, and replacing spaces and hyphens with underscores.\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n   - Test the function with different types of column names to ensure it handles various cases (e.g., \"MyColumn\", \"my column\", \"my-column\") correctly.\n   - Ensure that the function is type-stable and does not introduce any unnecessary allocations.\n\nPlease provide the Special Instructions to proceed with the task specific to your requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,344],"elapsed":9.259575191,"_type":"aimessage"}]
