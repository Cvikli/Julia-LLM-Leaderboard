The cleaning process involves:\n\n1. Lowercasing the column name using `lowercase(col)`.\n2. Stripping any leading and trailing whitespaces with `strip(col)`.\n3. Replacing spaces and hyphens with underscores using `replace(col, r\"\\s|-\" => \"_\")` where `r\"\\s|-\"` is a regular expression matching any whitespace or hyphen.\n\nThe function is designed to be brief and concise, and it adheres to the latest Julia language syntax.","status":200,"tokens":[0,229],"elapsed":6.634262773,"_type":"aimessage"}]
