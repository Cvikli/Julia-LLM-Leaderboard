It first lowercases the string, then strips any leading or trailing whitespace using `strip()`, which is a built-in Julia function that removes both leading and trailing whitespace from the string. Finally, it replaces spaces and hyphens with underscores using `replace()`, which is also a built-in function for replacing patterns in strings.\n\nYou can use this function to clean column names as follows:\n\n```julia\njulia> col_name = \"My Column\"\n\"My Column\"\n\njulia> clean_column(col_name)\n\"my_column\"\n```\n\nIn the example above, `clean_column` is applied to a string called `col_name`, and it returns the cleaned version of the column name.","status":200,"tokens":[0,299],"elapsed":8.624984352,"_type":"aimessage"}]
