Lowercases the string using `lowercase()`.\n2. Strips leading and trailing whitespace using `strip()`.\n3. Replaces spaces and hyphens with an underscore using `replace(r\"\\s|-\" => \"_\")`, where `r\"\\s|-\"` is a regular expression matching any whitespace or hyphen characters.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\njulia> clean_column(\"My Column\")\n\"my_column\"\n```\n\nPlease note that the function assumes `col` is an abstract string and does not perform type checking or handle edge cases such as non-string inputs. It's also worth noting that if you are working with a specific data structure (like a DataFrame from the DataFrames.jl package), there might be built-in methods to clean column names that are more efficient and robust.","status":200,"tokens":[0,336],"elapsed":9.707482268,"_type":"aimessage"}]
