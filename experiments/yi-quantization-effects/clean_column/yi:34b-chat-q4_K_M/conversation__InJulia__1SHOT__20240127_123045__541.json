Lowercases the column name using `lowercase()`.\n2. Strips any leading or trailing whitespace using a regular expression that matches one or more occurrences of space, tab, carriage return, or newline characters at the beginning (`^`) or end (`$`) of the string.\n3. Replaces sequences of spaces and hyphens with underscores using another regular expression that matches one or more occurrences of either whitespace or hyphen characters.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\njulia> clean_column(\"My Column\")\n\"my_column\"\n\njulia> clean_column(\"  MyColumn-  \")\n\"mycolumn\"\n```\n\nPlease note that the `replace` function in Julia 1.6 and later versions allows for a more concise syntax with its `=>` operator, which was not available before. If you are using an older version of Julia, you would need to use the `sub` function or write a custom function to achieve the same result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,338],"elapsed":9.553062203,"_type":"aimessage"}]
