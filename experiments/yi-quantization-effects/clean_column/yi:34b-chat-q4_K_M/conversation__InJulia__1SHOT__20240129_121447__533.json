The column name is lowercased using `lowercase()`.\n2. Any leading or trailing whitespace is stripped using `strip(col)`.\n3. Spaces and hyphens are replaced with an underscore, followed by an underscore (`\"_\"`) to ensure the resulting string ends with an underscore.\n\nNote that this function does not handle edge cases like non-alphanumeric characters or multiple consecutive whitespaces. It is designed to clean up simple column names as described in the example.\n\nTo use the function, simply call it with a column name:\n\n```julia\njulia> clean_column(\"My Column\")\n\"my_column\"\n```\n\nThis will return \"my_column\" as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[0,251],"elapsed":7.232980388,"_type":"aimessage"}]
