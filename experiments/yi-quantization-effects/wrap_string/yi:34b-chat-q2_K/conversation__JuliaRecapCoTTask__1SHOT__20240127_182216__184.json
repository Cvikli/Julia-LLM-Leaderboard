[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

This is a very long sentence that needs to be wrapped at Hello World. This is a very long sentence that needs to be wrapped at Hello World.\")\n\"Hello World. This is a very long sentence that needs to be wrapped at Hello World.\\nThis is a very long sentence that needs to be wrapped at Hello World.\"\n```\n\nPlease note that the function `wrap_string` works by splitting the input string into words and then joining them back together with newlines inserted where necessary. The default text width of 10 is used in the example, but this can be changed to any desired value when calling the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,303],"elapsed":7.880290609,"_type":"aimessage"}]
