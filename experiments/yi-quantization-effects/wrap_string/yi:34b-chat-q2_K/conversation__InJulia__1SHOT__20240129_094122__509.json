It also includes a default value of 10 for `text_width` if none is provided. The function then joins each line with a newline character (`\"\\n\"`) to create a multi-line string.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use the `wrap_string` function:\n\n```julia\n# Example text to wrap\ntext = \"Hello there, this is a longer sentence that should be wrapped across multiple lines.\"\n\n# Apply the wrapping\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text)\n\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nWhen you call `wrap_string` with the text and print the result, it will output something like:\n\n```plaintext\nHello there, this is a longer sentence that should be wrapped across multiple lines.\n```\n\nThe original string has been broken into several lines, respecting the maximum length specified by `text_width`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,409],"elapsed":10.893029478,"_type":"aimessage"}]
