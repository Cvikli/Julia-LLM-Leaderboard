This is a very long sentence that should be wrapped at the specified text width.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, 20)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nThis function splits the input `text` into words and iterates over them. For each word, it checks if adding it to the current line would exceed the specified `text_width`. If so, a new line is started. After all words have been processed, the resulting lines are joined with a newline character (`\"\\n\"`) to create the wrapped text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,234],"elapsed":18.13702418,"_type":"aimessage"}]
