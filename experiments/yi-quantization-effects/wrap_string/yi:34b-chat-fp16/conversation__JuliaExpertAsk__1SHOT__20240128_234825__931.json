The `split` function is used to split the text into an array of words, and `length(lines)` is the sum of the lengths of all the words that have already been added to the current line. The `join` function is then used to join the lines back into a string with newline characters between them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,246],"elapsed":19.053815533,"_type":"aimessage"}]
