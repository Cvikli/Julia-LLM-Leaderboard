[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded.

It ensures that each line does not exceed `text_width` characters (including spaces between words). If a word would cause the line to exceed the width limit, or if we encounter a literal newline character within the text, a new line is started.\n\nThe function also handles the case where a word is longer than the maximum allowed width by throwing an `ArgumentError`. This is to ensure that the input text can be safely wrapped without truncating any words.\n\nHere's an example of how to use this function:\n\n```julia\njulia> wrap_string(\"Hello there, how are you today?\\nthis is a test string with long words.\")\n\"Hello there, how are you today?\\n\\nthis is a test string with long words.\"\n```\n\nIn this example, the text has been wrapped at 10 characters per line, and any lines that were shorter than 10 characters have been indented with a space. The function also handles the newline character in the middle of the text correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,432],"elapsed":14.288936448,"_type":"aimessage"}]
