It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Below is a simple definition of the `wrap_string` function in Julia that does what you've described:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text, text_width::Int=10)\n    lines = []\n    current_line = \"\"\n    for word in split(text)\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) <= text_width\n            current_line *= \" $word\"\n        else\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = \"$word\"\n        end\n    end\n    push!(lines, current_line)\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function splits the text into words using `split`, then iterates over each word. It appends each word to a line until the line length plus the word length would exceed `text_width`. When that happens, it starts a new line and continues appending. Finally, it joins all the lines back together with newline characters between them.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use this function:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"Hello there! This is some text that I want to wrap into multiple lines.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, 20)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n# Output will look something like this (with line breaks added by the println function):\n# Hello there! This is\n# some text that I\n# want to wrap into\n# multiple lines.\n```\n\nYou can adjust the `text_width` parameter as needed to change the maximum length of each line.","status":200,"tokens":[0,365],"elapsed":11.883489159,"_type":"aimessage"}]
