It then iterates over these words and for each word, checks if adding it to the current line would exceed the specified `text_width`. If so, it starts a new line. Finally, it joins all the lines back together with a newline character between them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,246],"elapsed":7.991910665,"_type":"aimessage"}]
