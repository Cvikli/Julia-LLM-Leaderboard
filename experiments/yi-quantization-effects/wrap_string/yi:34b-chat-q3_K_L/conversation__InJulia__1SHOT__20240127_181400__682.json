Below is a definition of the `wrap_string` function in Julia that wraps text at a specified width and includes a demonstration of its usage:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString; text_width::Int=10)\n    # Split the string into lines based on word boundaries.\n    lines = split(text, r\"\\s+\")\n    \n    # Initialize an empty string to accumulate wrapped lines.\n    wrapped_text = \"\"\n    \n    # Iterate over each line and wrap it if necessary.\n    for line in lines\n        if length(line) > text_width\n            # Split the current line into parts that fit within the width limit.\n            parts = split(line, lpad(' ', text_width))\n            \n            # Append each part to the wrapped text, followed by a newline.\n            for part in parts\n                wrapped_text *= part * \"\\n\"\n            end\n        else\n            # If the line fits within the width limit, just add it without wrapping.\n            wrapped_text *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return wrapped_text\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ntext = \"Hello there! How are you doing today? This is a very long sentence that I expect will be wrapped across multiple lines.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, text_width=80)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nThis function splits the input string at whitespace to get individual words and then decides whether each word or combination of words fits within the specified `text_width`. If it does not, the line is split at spaces to create a new wrapped line that begins with the next word after the width limit was reached. The result is a multi-line string where each line is no longer than the specified width.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the text provided can be cleanly wrapped based on word boundaries and does not handle cases where there might be non-breaking characters or special handling for punctuation. It also does not preserve exact character counts but rather wraps at the specified width, which may result in some variation from line to line.","status":200,"tokens":[0,486],"elapsed":13.415207588,"_type":"aimessage"}]
