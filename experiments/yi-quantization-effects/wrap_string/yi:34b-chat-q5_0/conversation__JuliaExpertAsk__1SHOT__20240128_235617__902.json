For each word, it checks if adding that word to the current sum of line lengths would exceed the `text_width`. If so, it starts a new line. Finally, it joins all the lines back together with newline characters between them.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\njulia> wrap_string(\"Hello world this is a very long sentence that should be wrapped into multiple lines based on a maximum width of 10 characters per line.\")\n\"Hello\\nworld\\nthis\\nis\\na\\nvery\\nlong\\nsentence\\nthat\\nshould\\nbe\\nwrapped\\ninto\\nmultiple\\nlines\\nbased\\non\\na\\nmaximum\\nwidth\\nof\\n10\\ncharacters\\nper\\nline.\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,286],"elapsed":9.072189315,"_type":"aimessage"}]
