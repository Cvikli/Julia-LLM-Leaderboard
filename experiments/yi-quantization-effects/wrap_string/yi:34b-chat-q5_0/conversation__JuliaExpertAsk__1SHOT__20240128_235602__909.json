It appends each word to a current line, checking if the length of the current line plus the length of the word would exceed the specified `text_width`. If so, it starts a new line and adds the current line to the result. The final line is added only if it's not empty.","status":200,"tokens":[0,270],"elapsed":8.560979458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
