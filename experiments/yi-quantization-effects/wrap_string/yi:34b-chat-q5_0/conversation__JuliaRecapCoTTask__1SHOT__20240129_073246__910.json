[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

It ensures that each line does not exceed the specified `text_width` by adding a new line when necessary. The final string is obtained by joining the lines with a newline character `\"\\n\"`.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\njulia> wrap_string(\"This is a very long sentence that should be wrapped into multiple lines.\")\n\"This is a very long sentence that should \\n be wrapped into multiple lines.\"\n```\n\nIn this example, the function inserts a new line after the word \"sentence\" because the length of the current line plus the next word would exceed the `text_width` of 10 characters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,314],"elapsed":10.106723191,"_type":"aimessage"}]
