It checks if the combined length of the current line plus the word exceeds the specified `text_width`. If so, it adds a new line to the result. The `join` function is used to concatenate the lines with empty strings when needed, and then the final string is joined with newline characters between each line.","status":200,"tokens":[0,269],"elapsed":8.528975421,"_type":"aimessage"}]
