[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded.

For each word, it checks if adding it to the current line would exceed the specified `text_width`. If so, it adds the current line to the result and starts a new line. After all words have been processed, it returns a string with the wrapped lines.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```julia\njulia> wrap_string(\"Hello there! How are you today?\")\n\"Hello there!\\nHow are you today?\"\n\njulia> wrap_string(\"Hello there! How are you today?\", text_width=10)\n\"Hello\\nthere! How\\nare you\\ntoday?\"\n```\n\nIn the first example, since the default `text_width` is 10 and each word fits within that limit, no wrapping occurs. In the second example, with a custom `text_width` of 10, the function correctly wraps the text at the end of each line to ensure that each line does not exceed 10 characters.","status":200,"tokens":[378,460],"elapsed":21.106794611,"_type":"aimessage"}]
