[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded.

If the length of the current line plus the length of the word exceeds the specified `text_width`, a new line is started. After all words have been processed, the resulting lines are joined with a newline character.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\njulia> wrap_string(\"Hello there This is a very long sentence that should be wrapped into multiple lines.\")\n\"Hello there\\nThis is a very long sentence that should be wrapped into multiple lines.\"\n```\n\nIn this case, the `text_width` parameter is not specified, so the default value of 10 is used. The function wraps the text at each space where the total length of the line would exceed 10 characters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,313],"elapsed":10.075789687,"_type":"aimessage"}]
