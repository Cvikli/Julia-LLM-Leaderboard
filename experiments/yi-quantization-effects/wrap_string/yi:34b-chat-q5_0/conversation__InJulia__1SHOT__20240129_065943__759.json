Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can define a function to wrap the string into multiple lines while maintaining a specific text width. Here's how you can implement such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString; text_width::Int=10)\n    # Split the text into words\n    words = split(text)\n    output = \"\"\n    current_line = \"\"\n    for word in words\n        # Calculate the length of the current line with the new word\n        new_length = length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 # +1 for the space\n        # If the line is longer than the maximum width, start a new line\n        if new_length > text_width\n            output *= \"\\n\" * (current_line == \"\" ? word : current_line * \" \" * word)\n            current_line = \"\"\n        end\n        # Append the word to the current line\n        current_line = (current_line == \"\" ? word : current_line * \" \" * word)\n    end\n    # Handle the remaining characters in the last line\n    output *= \"\\n\" * current_line\n    return output\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ntext = \"Hello there! This is a very long string that I want to wrap into multiple lines.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nThis function splits the text into words, and for each word, it calculates whether appending it to the current line would exceed the specified `text_width`. If so, a new line is started. The function then joins the lines back together with newline characters in between.\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes that all words fit within the maximum text width when preceded by a space. If you have very long words that are longer than the specified `text_width`, they will still be appended to the current line, potentially causing an overflow. In such cases, you might want to consider additional logic to handle these edge cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,457],"elapsed":14.513985845,"_type":"aimessage"}]
