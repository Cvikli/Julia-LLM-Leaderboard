Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can create a function `wrap_string` that breaks up a string into multiple lines based on the specified `text_width`. The following code demonstrates how to implement such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString; text_width::Int=10)\n    output = IOBuffer() # Use an IOBuffer to accumulate the output without allocating a vector\n    for word in split(text)\n        if length(word) + position(output.data, 0) > text_width\n            write(output, \"\\n\") # Add a new line if the current position plus word length exceeds the width\n        end\n        write(output, word)\n    end\n    String(take!(output)) # Convert the buffer to a string and return it\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ntext = \"Hello there! This is a very long text that should be wrapped into multiple lines.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, text_width=50)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nThis function uses an `IOBuffer` to write the output without allocating memory for a vector. It splits the input string into words using `split` and then writes each word to the buffer, adding a new line after each word if it would cause the resulting line to exceed the specified `text_width`.\n\nPlease note that this function is not perfect; it does not handle cases where a word exactly equals or exceeds the `text_width`, nor does it deal with preserving whitespace (e.g., leading and trailing spaces). It's also not optimized for performance. For advanced use cases, you might want to look into existing libraries that provide more robust text wrapping functionality.","status":200,"tokens":[0,383],"elapsed":12.159523705,"_type":"aimessage"}]
