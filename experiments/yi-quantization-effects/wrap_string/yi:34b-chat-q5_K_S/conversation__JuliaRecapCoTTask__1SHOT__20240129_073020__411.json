[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

If the length of the line exceeds `text_width`, it breaks the line and adds a new one. The function also handles the case where the last word does not reach the `text_width` limit by trimming the trailing space.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\njulia> wrap_string(\"Hello World This is a very long sentence that should be wrapped.\")\n\"Hello World\\nThis is a very long sentence that should be wrapped.\"\n```\n\nIn this example, the function breaks the string into two lines at the space between \"World\" and \"This\" because the length of the word \"World\" plus the following space exceeds the `text_width` of 10 characters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,326],"elapsed":10.493164186,"_type":"aimessage"}]
