Below is an example of how you can write a `wrap_string` function in Julia that wraps text at the specified width and includes an example usage:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    lines = []\n    current_line = \"\"\n    for word in split(text)\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) >= text_width\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = \"\"\n        end\n        current_line *= \" \" * word\n    end\n    if current_line != \"\"\n        push!(lines, current_line)\n    end\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ntext = \"Hello there this is a very long sentence that will need to be wrapped across multiple lines.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, 20)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nThis function splits the text into words using `split` and then builds an array of lines. It adds a new line whenever the current line length plus the length of the next word would exceed the specified `text_width`. The `wrap_string` function returns the wrapped text as a string with each line separated by a newline character.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that words are delimited by whitespace and does not handle special cases such as hyphenated words or multi-word units (e.g., \"e-mail\"). It also does not ensure that the last line is full width. You might want to adjust these behaviors based on your needs.","status":200,"tokens":[0,373],"elapsed":11.845659828,"_type":"aimessage"}]
