Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can define a function `wrap_string` that wraps a string at word boundaries to ensure it does not exceed a certain width per line. Below is an example of how you might implement this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString; text_width::Int=10)\n    # Iterate over the characters in the text, adding new lines when necessary\n    output = \"\"\n    for i in eachindex(text)\n        if i == 1 || text[i-1] == ' ' || length(output) + 1 + length(text[i:min(end, i+text_width-1)]) > text_width\n            # If this is not the first character and we're starting a new line or if the current line will exceed the width limit\n            if output != \"\"\n                # Add a new line if needed\n                output *= \"\\n\"\n            end\n            # Append the current word to the output, preceded by a space if it's not the first character in the line\n            output *= (i > 1 ? \" \" : \"\") * text[i:min(end, i+text_width-1)]\n        else\n            # Append the current character to the output without any leading spaces\n            output *= text[i]\n        end\n    end\n    return output\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ntext = \"Hello there! This is a very long sentence that I want to wrap into multiple lines.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nThis function checks if the current position in the text string, along with the next `text_width` characters (excluding the current character), will fit on a single line without exceeding the specified width. If it does not fit, it starts a new line and wraps the word at the current position. The function also handles the first word of the text, which might be preceded by a leading space if it does not fit exactly within the first `text_width` characters.\n\nPlease note that this function is designed to work with basic ASCII strings without any complex Unicode handling for now. It may need to be adjusted for more advanced use cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,498],"elapsed":15.873991123,"_type":"aimessage"}]
