For each word, it checks if its length plus the current sum of lengths of all lines in the output exceeds the specified `text_width`. If so, a new line is added to the output. The function returns a string with the wrapped text, where each line has a maximum length of `text_width` characters.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\njulia> wrap_string(\"A very long sentence that should be wrapped at 10 characters per line.\")\n\"A very long\\nsentence that\\nshould be\\nwrapped at\\n10 characters\\nper line.\"\n```\n\nThis example shows the function wrapping a sentence at 10 characters per line, as specified by the `text_width` parameter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,316],"elapsed":9.149621333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
