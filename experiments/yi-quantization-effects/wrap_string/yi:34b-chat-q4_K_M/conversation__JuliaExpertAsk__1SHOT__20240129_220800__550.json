It iterates over each word in the `String` and checks if appending the current word to the line would exceed the specified text width. If so, it starts a new line. Finally, it joins all the lines back into a single string and returns it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,209],"elapsed":6.046599079,"_type":"aimessage"}]
