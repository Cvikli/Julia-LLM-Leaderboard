For each word, it checks if adding the word to the current line would exceed the maximum `text_width`. If so, a new line is started. Once all the words have been processed, the resulting array of lines is joined with newline characters to create a multi-line string.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\njulia> wrap_string(\"Hello there this is a very long sentence that should be wrapped into multiple lines\")\n\"Hello there\\nthis is a very long sentence\\nthat should be wrapped into multiple lines\"\n```\n\nIn this example, the `wrap_string` function has been used with the default text width of 10. The original sentence exceeds this width, so it is wrapped and returned as a multi-line string.","status":200,"tokens":[65,294],"elapsed":13.9501624,"_type":"aimessage"}]
