[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

For each word, it checks if adding it to the current sum of line lengths would exceed the specified `text_width`. If so, it adds an empty string to the list of lines to ensure that a new line is started. Finally, it joins the lines back into a single string with newline characters between them.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\njulia> wrap_string(\"Hello there this is a very long sentence that should be wrapped at 10 characters per line.\")\n\"Hello there\\nthis is a very\\nlong sentence\\nthat should be\\nwrapped at 10\\ncharacters per line.\"\n```\n\nIn the example above, the original string has been broken into multiple lines, with each line containing no more than 10 characters (including whitespace).","status":200,"tokens":[0,301],"elapsed":8.845829506,"_type":"aimessage"}]
