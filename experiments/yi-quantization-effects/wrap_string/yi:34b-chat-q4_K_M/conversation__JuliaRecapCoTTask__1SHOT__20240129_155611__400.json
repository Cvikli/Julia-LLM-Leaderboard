[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

It checks if each word exceeds the specified `text_width`. If a word does exceed the text width while appending to the lines array, an `ErrorException` is thrown. If appending a word would cause the combined length of the current line to exceed the text width, a new line is started. Finally, all the lines are joined with a newline character to form the wrapped string.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\njulia> wrap_string(\"Hello there this is a very long sentence that should be wrapped at 10 characters per line.\")\n\"Hello there\\nthis is a very\\nlong sentence\\nthat should be\\nwrapped at 10\\ncharacters per line.\"\n```\n\nIn the example, each line is wrapped at 10 characters, as specified by the `text_width` parameter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,334],"elapsed":9.804186237,"_type":"aimessage"}]
