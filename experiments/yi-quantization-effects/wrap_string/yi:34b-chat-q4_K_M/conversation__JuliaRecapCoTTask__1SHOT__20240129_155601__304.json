[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded.

For each line, it splits the words and decides whether to add the word to the current line or start a new line based on the `text_width` limit. The `i` variable is used to track the current position in the line being built.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use this function:\n\n```julia\njulia> wrap_string(\"Hello there, how are you today? This is a very long sentence that should be wrapped at 10 characters per line.\")\n\"Hello there,\\nhow are you today?\\nThis is a very long sentence that should be wrapped at 10 characters per line.\"\n```\n\nIn this example, the text is wrapped at each space where the total length of the remaining text plus the next word would exceed `text_width`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,474],"elapsed":13.949897124,"_type":"aimessage"}]
