[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded.

If adding the word would exceed the width, the current line is wrapped and the next line starts with the word.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\njulia> wrap_string(\"Hello World this is a very long sentence that should be wrapped into multiple lines\")\n\"Hello World\\nthis is a very long sentence that should be wrapped into multiple lines\"\n```\n\nBy default, the function uses a text width of 10 characters per line. You can specify a different value by providing an `Int` for the `text_width` parameter:\n\n```julia\njulia> wrap_string(\"Hello World this is a very long sentence that should be wrapped into multiple lines\", 25)\n\"Hello World\\nthis is a very long sentence\\nthat should be wrapped into multiple lines\"\n```\n\nThis function does not handle newlines within the text itself. If you need to preserve newlines in the input text, you would need to modify the function to account for this.","status":200,"tokens":[0,434],"elapsed":11.933567352,"_type":"aimessage"}]
