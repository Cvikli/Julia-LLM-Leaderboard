[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

It iterates over the words in the text and appends them to the current line until the length of the current line plus the word exceeds the `text_width`. When this happens, the current line is added to the list of lines and the current line is reset to an empty string.\n\nThe function then returns all the lines joined with a newline character (`\"\\n\"`).\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\njulia> wrap_string(\"Hello there this is a very long sentence that will be wrapped into multiple lines\")\n\"Hello there\\nthis is a very long sentence\\nthat will be wrapped into multiple lines\"\n```\n\nBy default, the function uses a text width of 10 characters per line. You can adjust this by providing a different value for `text_width` when calling the function:\n\n```julia\njulia> wrap_string(\"Hello there this is a very long sentence that will be wrapped into multiple lines\", text_width=20)\n\"Hello there this is\\na very long sentence\\nthat will be wrapped into\\nmultiple lines\"\n```\n\nThe function has been written to prioritize clarity and readability over extreme optimization. However, it should perform well for its intended use case.","status":200,"tokens":[0,424],"elapsed":11.390855498,"_type":"aimessage"}]
