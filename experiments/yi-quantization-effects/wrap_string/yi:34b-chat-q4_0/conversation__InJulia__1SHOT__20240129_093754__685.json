Below is a simple implementation of the `wrap_string` function in Julia that wraps a string at word boundaries to fit within a specified text width. The function also handles the case where the last line doesn't reach the maximum width, ensuring that it is not prematurely truncated.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString; text_width::Int=10)\n    lines = []\n    current_line = \"\"\n    for word in split(text)\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) <= text_width\n            # Append the word to the current line\n            current_line *= \" \" * word\n        else\n            # Exceeds width, so add the current line and start a new one\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        end\n    end\n    # Append any remaining characters from the last line\n    if length(current_line) > 0\n        push!(lines, current_line)\n    end\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ntext = \"This is a very long string that will be wrapped into multiple lines.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, text_width=20)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, you should see something like the following printed to the console:\n\n```\nThis is a very long\nstring that will be\nwrapped into multiple\nlines.\n```\n\nThe `wrap_string` function works by iterating over the words in the input string and appending them to a current line. If the length of the current line plus the word exceeds the specified text width, the word is added to the next line. The function also handles the case where the last line doesn't have enough words to fill the width, ensuring that it is not prematurely terminated.","status":200,"tokens":[0,427],"elapsed":11.527464727,"_type":"aimessage"}]
