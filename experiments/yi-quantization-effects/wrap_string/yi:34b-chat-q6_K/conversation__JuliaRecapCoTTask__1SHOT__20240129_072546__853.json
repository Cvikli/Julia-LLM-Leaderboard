[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Given the task description and the special instructions provided, here's how I would approach solving this problem using Julia:\n\nFirst, let's define a function `wrap_string` that takes in a string `text` and an optional argument `text_width`:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString; text_width::Int=10)\n    # Your code goes here\nend\n```\n\nNext, we'll write the body of the function. We need to iterate over each word in the string and check if it, along with any remaining characters (if the word is not at the end of the text), will exceed `text_width`. If so, we add a new line character and continue from the next word.\n\nHere's how I would implement this:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString; text_width::Int=10)\n    lines = Vector{SubString{String}}() # Initialize an empty vector to store wrapped lines\n    current_line = \"\"                     # Initialize an empty string for the current line\n    for word in split(text)               # Iterate over each word in the text\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) > text_width\n            push!(lines, current_line) # If the current line exceeds the width, add it to the result\n            current_line = \"\"          # and start a new line\n        end\n        current_line *= word * ' '      # Append the word to the current line with a space\n    end\n    if length(current_line) > 0         # If there's anything left in the current line, add it to the result\n        push!(lines, current_line)\n    end\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")            # Join all the lines with new line characters\nend\n```\n\nNow let's test our function with an example:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Integer posuere erat a ante.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(text))\n```\n\nThis should print out the text wrapped according to the specified `text_width`.\n\nLastly, we double-check that our solution is correct by ensuring it meets the task requirements:\n\n- It iterates over words in a string.\n- It adds a new line when the width limit would be exceeded.\n- The function takes an optional argument for the text width and has a default value set.\n- The example provided above demonstrates the usage of the function and should output wrapped lines.\n\nIf the solution meets all these criteria, we can conclude that it is correct.","status":200,"tokens":[0,604],"elapsed":22.773024676,"_type":"aimessage"}]
