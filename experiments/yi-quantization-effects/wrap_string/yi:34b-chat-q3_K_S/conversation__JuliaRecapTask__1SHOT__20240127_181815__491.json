[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

This is a test of the wrap_string function.\")\n5-element Vector{SubString}:\n \"Hello World!\"\n \"This is a te\"\n \"st of the wa\"\n \"p_string fun\"\n \"ction.\"\n```\n\nExplanation:\nThe `wrap_string` function iterates over each word in the text, keeping track of the current line and ensuring that it does not exceed the specified `text_width`. If a word exceeds the width or adding it to the current line would cause the line to exceed the width, the line is added to the result, and the current line is reset. The function also handles the case where there are no spaces in the text by default.","status":200,"tokens":[0,318],"elapsed":8.566867383,"_type":"aimessage"}]
