It iterates over each word in the text and appends them to a new line until the line exceeds the specified width. If the line exceeds the width, it is split into multiple lines at each space character. The resulting array of strings is then joined back together with newline characters between each line.","status":200,"tokens":[0,232],"elapsed":6.411298401,"_type":"aimessage"}]
