It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the `wrap_string` function in Julia that wraps text to a specified width by inserting line breaks:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    result = String[]\n    current_line = \"\"\n    for word in split(text)\n        if length(current_line * word) > text_width\n            push!(result, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            current_line *= word * \" \"\n        end\n    end\n    push!(result, current_line)\n    return join(result) * \"\\n\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function splits the text into words using `split()` and then iterates over them. It uses a space as the delimiter to concatenate the words onto the current line. If the length of the current line plus the word exceeds the specified width, it adds the current line to the result array and starts a new line for the next word.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"Hello there! How are you today? This text is quite long and will be wrapped accordingly.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nThis will output something like:\n\n```plaintext\nHello there! How are you today? This text is quite long and will be wrapped accordingly.\n```\n\nThe `*` operator is used for string concatenation in Julia. The asterisk between the two strings multiplies each character of the first string onto the end of the second string, with a space inserted between them if the characters are not numeric. In this case, we're using it to concatenate the words and then the resulting string is joined by spaces.","status":200,"tokens":[0,401],"elapsed":10.645220656,"_type":"aimessage"}]
