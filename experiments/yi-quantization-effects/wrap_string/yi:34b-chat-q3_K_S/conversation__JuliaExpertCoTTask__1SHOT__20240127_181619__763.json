It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"## Solution\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(str::AbstractString; text_width::Int = 10)\n    lines = []\n    for word in split(str, ' ')\n        # If the current line plus the new word would exceed the maximum width, add a new line\n        if length(join([word], \" \")) + length(join(lines, \" \")) > text_width\n            push!(lines, join(lines, \"\\n\"))\n            lines = []\n        end\n        # Add the word to the current line\n        push!(lines, word)\n    end\n    return join(lines, \" \")\nend\n```\n\n## Verification\n\nWrap the provided string:\n\n```julia\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")  # should return \"This function will\\nwrap words into\\nlines\"\n```\n\nThe function works by iterating over the words in a string and appending them to a new line. If at any point the length of the current line, plus the next word, would exceed `text_width`, it adds a newline and starts a new line. This process continues until all words have been processed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,273],"elapsed":7.263602997,"_type":"aimessage"}]
