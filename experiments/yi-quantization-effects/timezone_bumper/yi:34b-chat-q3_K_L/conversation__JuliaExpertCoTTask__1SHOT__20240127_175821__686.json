If so, it returns the original `dt`. If `bump` is a positive integer, it increments the hour of the DateTime by that value and returns the new DateTime. If `bump` is negative, an `ArgumentError` is thrown. The default value for `bump` is set to 3 hours.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the time zone is already adjusted to the desired time zone. If the input `dt` is in UTC and you want to bump it by a specific number of hours in another time zone, you would need to account for time zone conversions as well.","status":200,"tokens":[0,301],"elapsed":8.312997177,"_type":"aimessage"}]
