Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To write a function in Julia that adjusts the time of a `DateTime` object by a specified number of hours, you can use the following code:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    if isa(dt, Date)\n        throw(ErrorException(\"Cannot adjust date without time. Use DateTime type instead.\"))\n    end\n    return DateTime(DateTime(dt) + Hour(bump))\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a `DateTime` object and an optional integer `bump` which specifies the number of hours to add. If no `bump` is provided, it defaults to 3 hours. The function ensures that the input is a `DateTime` by throwing an error if someone tries to adjust a `Date` without specifying a time.\n\nTo use this function, you would simply call it with your `DateTime` object and optionally specify the number of hours to bump:\n\n```julia\njulia> using Dates\n\njulia> local_time = DateTime(\"2023-01-01T12:00:00\")  # Example time\n2023-01-01T12:00:00\n\njulia> new_time = timezone_bumper(local_time, 5)  # Adjust by 5 hours\n2023-01-01T17:00:00\n```\n\nIn this example, `local_time` is a `DateTime` object representing 12:00 PM on January 1st, 2023. When we call `timezone_bumper(local_time, 5)`, it adjusts the time by adding 5 hours to the original timestamp, resulting in `new_time` which is 17:00:00.","status":200,"tokens":[0,419],"elapsed":11.881492406,"_type":"aimessage"}]
