[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

It bumps the hour by the specified amount and ensures that the resulting hour is within the valid range (0-23). If the new hour falls outside of this range, it adjusts the date accordingly by adding or subtracting 24 hours.\n\n# Double Check\n\n- The function works only for `DateTime` types and throws an error for `Date` types.\n- It uses the `LocalTime` from the `TimeZones` package to handle timezone information accurately.\n- The default bump is set to +3 hours, but it can be overridden by the user.\n- The function ensures that the new hour falls within a valid range (0-23) and adjusts the date if necessary.\n- It returns a new `DateTime` with the updated time.\n\n# Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}","status":200,"tokens":[0,434],"elapsed":12.483358976,"_type":"aimessage"}]
