[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"If no special instructions are provided, I'll proceed with the task assuming the following:\n\n1. The `dt` parameter is a `DateTime` object.\n2. The `bump` parameter is an integer specifying the number of hours to add. If not specified, it defaults to +3 hours.\n3. The function should throw an error if `dt` is a `Date` type.\n\nHere's the solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    if typeof(dt) == Date\n        error(\"Cannot add hours to a Date object. Please provide a DateTime object.\")\n    end\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nNow, let's double-check that the solution is correct:\n\n- The function checks if `dt` is a `Date` and throws an error if so.\n- It uses the default value of `3` for `bump` if not provided.\n- The `Hour(bump)` constructor is used to add hours to the `DateTime` object.\n\nThe function is now ready to use with `DateTime` objects. If additional special instructions are provided, please include them in the comment, and I'll update the solution accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,284],"elapsed":8.151642533,"_type":"aimessage"}]
