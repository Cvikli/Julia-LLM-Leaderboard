If no value is provided for `bump`, it defaults to adding 3 hours. The function checks that the input is indeed a `DateTime` type and throws an error if not. It then calculates the new timestamp by adding the specified number of hours using `Dates.Hour` and returns the updated `DateTime` object.","status":200,"tokens":[0,217],"elapsed":6.265719761,"_type":"aimessage"}]
