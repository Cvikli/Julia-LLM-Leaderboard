If `bump` is not provided, it defaults to adding 3 hours. The function ensures that the input is a `DateTime` type; if it's a `Date` type, an error is thrown indicating that the operation can only be performed on `DateTime` types.\n\nThe return value is a new `DateTime` object with the specified number of hours added to the original time.","status":200,"tokens":[0,220],"elapsed":6.335201083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
