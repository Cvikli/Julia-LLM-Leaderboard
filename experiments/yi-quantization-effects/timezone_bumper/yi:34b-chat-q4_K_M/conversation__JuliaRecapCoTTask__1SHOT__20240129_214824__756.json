[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

The default bump value is set to +3 hours.\n\nTo ensure that only `DateTime` types are accepted, we use a type assertion within the function. If the input `dt` is not a `DateTime`, an `ArgumentError` is thrown with a custom message indicating that the function only works with `DateTime` types.\n\nPlease note that this function does not account for daylight saving time (DST) changes or any other timezone-related complexities beyond simple addition of hours to the timestamp. It assumes that the provided DateTime is already in the desired timezone and does not perform any kind of timezone conversion.","status":200,"tokens":[0,274],"elapsed":8.057450717,"_type":"aimessage"}]
