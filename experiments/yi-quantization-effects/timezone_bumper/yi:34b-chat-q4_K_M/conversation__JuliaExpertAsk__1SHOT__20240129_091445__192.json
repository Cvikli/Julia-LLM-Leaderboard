It then ensures that the new hour value falls within the range of valid hours for a `DateTime`, which is from 0 to 23. Finally, it converts the modified Julian day number back into a `DateTime` using the original time zone information from the input `DateTime`.\n\nThe function also handles the case where `bump` is not provided by defaulting to adding 12 hours. This can be useful if you want to represent midnight as the start of the next day or noon as the middle of the current day without having to specify a positive or negative direction for the time adjustment.","status":200,"tokens":[0,321],"elapsed":9.268922821,"_type":"aimessage"}]
