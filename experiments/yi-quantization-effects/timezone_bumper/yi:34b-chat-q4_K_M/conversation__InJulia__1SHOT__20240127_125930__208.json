Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can define a function to increase the time of a `DateTime` by a certain number of hours. Here's how you can create such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    # Convert DateTime to Time type for manipulation\n    time = Time(dt)\n    \n    # Adjust the time by adding hours\n    new_time = time + Duration(bump, Unitful.Hour)\n    \n    # Convert back to DateTime and return\n    return DateTime(new_time)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a `DateTime` object `dt` and an optional integer `bump` which represents the number of hours to add. If `bump` is not provided, it defaults to 3 hours. The function works by first converting the `DateTime` to a `Time` type using the `Time(dt)` method. Then, it adjusts the time by adding the specified number of hours using the `+` operator with a `Duration` object. Finally, it converts the result back to a `DateTime` and returns it.\n\nTo ensure that the function works only for `DateTime` types and not for `Date` types, you can throw an error if someone tries to call the function with a `Date`:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date)\n    error(\"timezone_bumper cannot be applied to Date objects. Please use DateTime objects instead.\")\nend\n```\n\nBy defining the function for both `DateTime` and `Date` types with a default method that errors, you ensure that calling the function with a `Date` will result in an error message indicating that it's not supported.","status":200,"tokens":[0,380],"elapsed":10.744657067,"_type":"aimessage"}]
