If `bump` is not provided or is zero, it defaults to adding 3 hours. The function checks if the input `dt` is indeed a `DateTime` type and throws an `ArgumentError` if it's not. It then adds the specified number of hours to the timestamp using the `Dates.Hour` constructor for type stability.","status":200,"tokens":[0,193],"elapsed":5.558571179,"_type":"aimessage"}]
