It then bumps the time by the specified number of hours (defaulting to 3 hours) using the `Hour` constructor from the `Dates` module. Finally, a new `DateTime` object is created with the bumped time, maintaining the year, month, day, and any sub-second precision from the original timestamp.","status":200,"tokens":[0,250],"elapsed":7.24858036,"_type":"aimessage"}]
