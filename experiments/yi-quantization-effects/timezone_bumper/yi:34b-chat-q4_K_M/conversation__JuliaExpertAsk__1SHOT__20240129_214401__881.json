If `bump` is not provided, it defaults to adding 3 hours. The `utc_timestamp` method is used to convert the `DateTime` to a unix timestamp in UTC, and then `Dates.Hour` is used to add the specified number of hours to this timestamp. Finally, the result is converted back to a `DateTime` object using the `DateTime` constructor.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes the provided `dt` is in UTC. If you need to handle timestamps in other time zones, you would need to provide additional logic to convert the `DateTime` to and from the appropriate time zone before and after adjusting the timestamp.","status":200,"tokens":[0,224],"elapsed":6.487093861,"_type":"aimessage"}]
