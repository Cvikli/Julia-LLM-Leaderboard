Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can create a custom function to adjust the time of a `DateTime` object by a specified number of hours. Here's how you can define such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    # Convert DateTime to Time type for easier arithmetic\n    time = Time(dt)\n    \n    # Adjust the time by the specified number of hours\n    new_time = time + Duration(bump, Unitful.Hour)\n    \n    # Convert back to DateTime and return\n    return DateTime(new_time)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a `DateTime` object `dt` and an optional integer `bump` which specifies the number of hours to add. If `bump` is not provided, it defaults to 3 hours. The time part of the `DateTime` is converted to a `Time` type using the `Time(dt)` function, and then the time is adjusted by adding the specified number of hours using `Duration` from the `Unitful` package (which provides support for units in Julia). Finally, the result is converted back to a `DateTime` object and returned.\n\nTo ensure that this function only works with `DateTime` types and throws an error for `Date` types, you can add a type assertion:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Union{DateTime, Date}, bump::Int=3)\n    if isa(dt, Date)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Cannot adjust date without a time component. Use DateTime instead of Date.\"))\n    end\n    return timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump)\nend\n```\n\nThis way, if you pass a `Date` object, the function will throw an `ArgumentError` explaining that the date adjustment requires a `DateTime` with a time component.","status":200,"tokens":[0,413],"elapsed":11.934333026,"_type":"aimessage"}]
