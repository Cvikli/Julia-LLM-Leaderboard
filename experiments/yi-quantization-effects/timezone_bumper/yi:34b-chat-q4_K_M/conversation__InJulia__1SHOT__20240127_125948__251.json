If no `bump` is provided, it defaults to adding 3 hours. The function works by converting the `DateTime` into its equivalent Julian Date representation (which is just a number of days since January 1st, 2000), then adds the desired number of hours to that date, and finally converts back to a `DateTime` object with the specified time zone.\n\nThe function also includes a check to ensure that it is only applied to `DateTime` objects. If you try to pass a `Date` object, an error will be thrown.","status":200,"tokens":[0,293],"elapsed":8.274718735,"_type":"aimessage"}]
