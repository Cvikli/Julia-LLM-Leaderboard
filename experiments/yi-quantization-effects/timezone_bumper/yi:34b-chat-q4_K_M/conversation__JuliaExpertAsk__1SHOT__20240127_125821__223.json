It then calculates the new date-time by adding the specified number of hours (`bump`) to the current timezone offset using `utcdate2unix()`, which converts a DateTime to a Unix timestamp (seconds since 1970). Finally, it converts back to a `DateTime` and returns the result.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes the `Dates` package is imported and does not handle edge cases such as dates before or after the Unix epoch (Jan 1, 1970).","status":200,"tokens":[102,256],"elapsed":7.408011145,"_type":"aimessage"}]
