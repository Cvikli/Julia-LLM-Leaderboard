If no `bump` is provided, it defaults to adding 3 hours. It works by first converting the `DateTime` to a `Time` type using the `Time(dt)` method, which extracts just the time part of the date without changing its time zone offset. Then, it adds the specified number of hours to this `Time` object using a `Duration` with unit `Hour` from Unitful. Finally, it converts back to a `DateTime` and returns the result.\n\nThe function is designed to work only with `DateTime` types. If you try to pass a `Date` type, an error will be thrown because the `Time(date)` method does not exist for `Date` objects, which means that the function cannot proceed without first converting the date to a time-based object.","status":200,"tokens":[102,308],"elapsed":9.065075064,"_type":"aimessage"}]
