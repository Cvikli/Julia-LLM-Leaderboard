Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the implementation of the `timezone_bumper` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    if isa(dt, DateTime)\n        return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\n    elseif isa(dt, Date)\n        throw(DomainError(\"Cannot increase a Date by hours, use a DateTime instead.\"))\n    end\n    throw(DomainError(dt, \"Invalid type for dt, must be either DateTime or Date.\"))\nend\n```\n\nThis function accepts a `DateTime` object `dt` and an optional integer `bump` specifying the number of hours to increase the timestamp by. If `bump` is not provided, it defaults to adding 3 hours. The function will throw a `DomainError` if the input type is neither a `DateTime` nor a `Date`.\n\nTo use this function, you can do:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\n# Increase a DateTime by some hours\noriginal_dt = DateTime(2023, 1, 1, 12, 30)\nbumped_dt1 = timezone_bumper(original_dt, 5) # Bump by 5 hours\nbumped_dt2 = timezone_bumper(original_dt)    # Default bump of 3 hours\n\nprintln(\"Bumped datetime: $(bumped_dt1)\")\nprintln(\"Default bumped datetime: $(bumped_dt2)\")\n```\n\nPlease note that the `timezone_bumper` function does not consider time zone information. It simply adds a number of hours to the UTC timestamp of the `DateTime` object. If your original `DateTime` has a specific time zone associated with it, you would need to adjust the returned value accordingly. The `Dates` module in Julia assumes that if a time zone is not specified, you are working in UTC.","status":200,"tokens":[0,437],"elapsed":11.196211591,"_type":"aimessage"}]
