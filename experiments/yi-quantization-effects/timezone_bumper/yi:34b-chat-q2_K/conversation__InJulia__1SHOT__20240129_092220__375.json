Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can define the `timezone_bumper` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    if isa(dt, Date)\n        throw(ErrorException(\"Cannot bump time by hours for a Date type. Provide a DateTime instead.\"))\n    end\n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump * sign(bump))\nend\n```\n\nThis function accepts a `DateTime` object and an optional `bump` argument which defaults to 3 hours if not provided. It returns a new `DateTime` shifted by the specified number of hours. If you pass in a `Date` instead of a `DateTime`, it will throw an error informing you that only `DateTime` types can be bumped by hours.\n\nHere's how you can use the function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\ndt = DateTime(2021, 6, 1, 13, 45) # Some example DateTime\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt) # Bump by default (3 hours)\nprintln(bumped_dt)\n# Output: 2021-06-01T16:45:00\n\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, -5) # Bump by -5 hours (5 hours ago)\nprintln(bumped_dt)\n# Output: 2021-06-01T08:45:00\n```\n\nRemember that `Dates.Hour` is a constant used to represent the number of seconds per hour, and `sign(bump)` ensures that if `bump` is negative, it will still shift the date backward in time.","status":200,"tokens":[0,404],"elapsed":10.734008908,"_type":"aimessage"}]
