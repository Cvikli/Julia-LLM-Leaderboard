Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    if isa(dt, DateTime) || (bump >= 0 && dt > Date(1970)) # Check if date is after epoch and bump is non-negative\n        return DateTime(dt.year, dt.month, dt.day, dt.hour, dt.minute, dt.second, dt.millisecond; origin=Base.libc_timezone) + Duration(bump * 60 * 60)  # Add bump hours in UTC time\n    else\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Cannot increase timestamp by $bump hours from Date type or before Epoch (1970-01-01)\"))\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function checks if the provided `dt` is a DateTime or a Date with a time component (`dt > Date(1970)`). If it's a valid DateTime, it adds the specified number of hours to the timestamp using `Duration`. The `origin=Base.libc_timezone` argument ensures that the time zone information is taken into account when adding the duration.\n\nFor compatibility with Julia versions before 1.3, which did not have an explicit `DateTime` type, the following code assumes that any date after Epoch (1970-01-01) will be interpreted as a DateTime:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Union{Date, DateTime}, bump::Int = 3)\n    if isa(dt, Date) || (bump >= 0 && dt > Date(1970)) # Check if date is after epoch and bump is non-negative\n        return DateTime(dt.year, dt.month, dt.day, dt.hour, dt.minute, dt.second, dt.millisecond; origin=Base.libc_timezone) + Duration(bump * 60 * 60)  # Add bump hours in UTC time\n    else\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Cannot increase timestamp by $bump hours from Date type or before Epoch (1970-01-01)\"))\n    end\nend\n```\n\nPlease note that the `DateTime` constructor used here is a convenience alias for `Base.Dates.TimePoint` which was introduced in Julia 1.3 and later renamed to `DateTime` in Julia 1.6. If you need to support older versions of Julia, make sure to include the compatibility constructors as shown above.","status":200,"tokens":[102,568],"elapsed":14.811858105,"_type":"aimessage"}]
