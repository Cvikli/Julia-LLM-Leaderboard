Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, we can define the `timezone_bumper` function as follows:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    if isa(dt, Date)\n        throw(DomainError(\"Cannot increase a date by a time offset. Provide a DateTime instead!\"))\n    end\n    return DateTime(dt.year, dt.month, dt.day, dt.hour, dt.minute, dt.second, dt.millisecond, tz=tz) + Duration(0, 0, 0, bump * 60 * 60)  # Convert to seconds and add\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a `DateTime` object `dt` and an optional integer `bump` specifying the number of hours to increase the timestamp by. If no `bump` is provided, it defaults to +3 hours. The function also checks if the input is a `Date` type and throws an error in that case since we cannot increase just the date without specifying a time component.\n\nTo use this function, you can write:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\ndt = DateTime(2021, 6, 15, 8, 30)  # Some initial DateTime to bump forward\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt)  # Bump forward by 3 hours (default)\nprintln(bumped_dt)  # Output will be the new DateTime with a +3 hour increment from the original dt\n```\n\nPlease note that `Duration` in Julia represents time intervals, and we are using it to represent seconds here since `millisecond` is already fine for representing hours. We convert hours to seconds by multiplying by 60 (minutes per hour) twice: once for minutes and once for seconds.","status":200,"tokens":[75,401],"elapsed":14.781240188,"_type":"aimessage"}]
