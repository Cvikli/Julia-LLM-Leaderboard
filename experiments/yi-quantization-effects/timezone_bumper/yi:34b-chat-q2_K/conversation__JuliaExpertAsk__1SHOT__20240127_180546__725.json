It then checks if the provided `dt` is a `Date` type and throws an error if so, as Date addition with a time interval is not applicable. The actual addition of hours is done using the `Hour` constructor from the DateTime API to ensure correct timezone handling.","status":200,"tokens":[0,205],"elapsed":5.241069384,"_type":"aimessage"}]
