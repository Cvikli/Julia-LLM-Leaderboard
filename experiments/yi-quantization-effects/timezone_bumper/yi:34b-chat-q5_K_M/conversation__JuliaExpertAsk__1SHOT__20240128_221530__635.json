If no value is provided for `bump`, it defaults to adding 3 hours. The function checks if the input `dt` is a `DateTime` type and bumps the time by the specified number of hours. It also ensures that the resulting object remains within the constraints of a `DateTime` (e.g., not allowing days to roll over). If the input is not a `DateTime` type, an `ArgumentError` is thrown with a custom message indicating that the function can only operate on `DateTime` types.","status":200,"tokens":[0,287],"elapsed":9.336661855,"_type":"aimessage"}]
