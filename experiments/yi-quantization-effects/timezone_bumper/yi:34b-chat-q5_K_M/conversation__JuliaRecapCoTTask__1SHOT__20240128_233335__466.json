[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

Finally, it converts back to a `DateTime` object using `Dates.unix2datetime()` and returns the result.\n\nThe default value for `bump` is set to 3 hours, but this can be overridden by providing a different integer value when calling the function.\n\nPlease note that this function does not account for daylight saving time (DST) changes or any other time zone complexities. It simply adds a fixed number of seconds to the Unix timestamp and assumes that the input `DateTime` is already in the desired timezone. If more sophisticated time zone handling is required, additional libraries like `TimeZones.jl` should be used.","status":200,"tokens":[0,328],"elapsed":10.831823479,"_type":"aimessage"}]
