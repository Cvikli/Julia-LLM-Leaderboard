Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can define a function that operates on `DateTime` values as follows:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    # Convert the DateTime to a Time type (without the date component)\n    time = Time(dt)\n    \n    # Adjust the time by the specified number of hours\n    new_time = time + Duration(bump, Unitful.Hour)\n    \n    # Rebuild the DateTime from the adjusted time and the original date\n    return DateTime(Date(dt), new_time)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a `DateTime` object `dt` and an optional integer `bump` which represents the number of hours to add. If `bump` is not provided, it defaults to adding 3 hours. The function first converts the `DateTime` to a `Time` object (which only holds the time component), adjusts the time by the specified duration using `Duration` and `Unitful.Hour` from the `Unitful` package, and then rebuilds the `DateTime` from the adjusted `Time` and the original date.\n\nTo ensure that the function works only with `DateTime` types and throws an error for `Date` types, you can add a type assertion:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    # ... original code above\nend\n\ntimezone_bumper(::Date, ::Int) = throw(ArgumentError(\"timezone_bumper can only be applied to DateTime values, not Date values.\"))\n```\n\nThis way, if someone tries to call `timezone_bumper` with a `Date` object, an error will be thrown explaining that the function is meant for `DateTime` types.\n\nRemember to install the `Unitful` package if you haven't already:\n\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"Unitful\")\n```\n\nYou can use the function as follows:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\nusing Unitful\n\ndt = DateTime(2023, 1, 1, 12, 0)  # An example DateTime value\nbump_hours = 5                    # Adjust by a different number of hours if desired\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, bump_hours)\nprintln(new_dt)\n```\n\nThis will output the new `DateTime` with the time adjusted by the specified number of hours.","status":200,"tokens":[0,561],"elapsed":17.899754701,"_type":"aimessage"}]
