By default, it adds 3 hours. The function checks if the input is indeed a `DateTime` and throws an error if it's not. It then increments the time by the specified number of hours using the `Duration` type from the `Unitful` package (which provides support for units in Julia). Finally, it returns the updated `DateTime` object.","status":200,"tokens":[0,236],"elapsed":18.300858406,"_type":"aimessage"}]
