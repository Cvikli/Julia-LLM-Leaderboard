Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Integer=3)\n    # Convert the DateTime into a TimeType\n    time = Time(dt)\n    \n    # Bump the time by the given number of hours\n    new_time = time + Duration(bump, Unitful.Hour)\n    \n    # Create a new DateTime from the bumped time and the date part of the original DateTime\n    return DateTime(new_time, Date(dt))\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes in a `DateTime` object `dt` and an optional integer `bump` which represents the number of hours to add. If `bump` is not provided, it defaults to adding 3 hours. It then converts the `DateTime` into its corresponding `Time` type and bumps the time by the given number of hours using a `Duration` object. Finally, it creates a new `DateTime` from the bumped `Time` and the original date.\n\nTo ensure that this function works only with `DateTime` types and throws an error for `Date` types, you can define an additional method for `timezone_bumper` with the same signature but different behavior:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Integer=3)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"Cannot add hours to a Date. Use DateTime instead.\"))\nend\n```\n\nThis additional method is a placeholder that will be called if someone tries to use `timezone_bumper` with a `Date` type. It simply throws an error, indicating that the function should only be used with `DateTime` types.","status":200,"tokens":[0,360],"elapsed":27.920906067,"_type":"aimessage"}]
