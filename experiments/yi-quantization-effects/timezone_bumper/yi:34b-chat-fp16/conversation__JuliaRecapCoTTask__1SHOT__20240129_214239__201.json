[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

It does this by first converting the `DateTime` to an Unix timestamp (seconds since the Unix epoch) using `Dates.datetime2unix`, then adding the desired number of hours in seconds, and finally converting back to a `DateTime` using `Dates.unix2datetime`.\n\nThe function checks that `bump` is an integer to prevent any potential issues with non-integer values.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes the provided `dt` is already in UTC timezone, as it does not account for local timezones. If the input `DateTime` is in a different timezone, the result will be incorrect.","status":200,"tokens":[0,268],"elapsed":20.912133064,"_type":"aimessage"}]
