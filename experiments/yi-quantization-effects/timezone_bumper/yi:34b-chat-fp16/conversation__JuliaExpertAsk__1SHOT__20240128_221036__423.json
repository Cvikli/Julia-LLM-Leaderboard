If no `bump` is provided, it defaults to adding 3 hours. The function ensures that the input is a `DateTime` by checking if it's an instance of `Date` using the `isa()` function. If so, it throws an error with a clear message explaining the limitation of the function.\n\nThe return value is a new `DateTime` object with the specified timezone bump applied to the original timestamp. This is achieved by creating a new `DateTime` constructor call with the appropriate year, month, day, and time components incremented by the given amount.","status":200,"tokens":[0,267],"elapsed":20.698798245,"_type":"aimessage"}]
