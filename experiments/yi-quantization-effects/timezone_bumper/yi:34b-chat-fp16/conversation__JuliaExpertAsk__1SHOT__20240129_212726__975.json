If `dt` is a `DateTime`, it adds the specified number of hours to the timestamp using `Duration` from the `Unitful` package, which provides a convenient way to work with time units in Julia. The default value for `bump` is set to 3 hours.","status":200,"tokens":[0,178],"elapsed":13.800094518,"_type":"aimessage"}]
