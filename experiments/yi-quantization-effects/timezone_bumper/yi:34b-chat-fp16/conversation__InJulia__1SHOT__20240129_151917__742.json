Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function in Julia that bumps the time of a `DateTime` object by a specified number of hours (`bump`), or by 3 hours if no argument is provided:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    if typeof(dt) == Date\n        error(\"Cannot add time zone offset to a Date. Please provide a DateTime object.\")\n    end\n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input `dt` is of type `Date`. If it is, an error is thrown because you cannot add a time zone offset to a date without a time component. If `dt` is a `DateTime`, the function adds the specified number of hours to the timestamp using the `Dates.Hour` constructor and returns the updated `DateTime` object.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\njulia> using Dates\n\njulia> timezone_bumper(DateTime(\"2023-01-01T09:00\"))\n2023-01-01T12:00:00\n\njulia> timezone_bumper(DateTime(\"2023-01-01T09:00\"), 5)\n2023-01-01T14:00:00\n```\n\nIn the first example, the timestamp is bumped by 3 hours (the default value for `bump`). In the second example, it's bumped by 5 hours because an explicit value was provided for `bump`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,384],"elapsed":29.78255519,"_type":"aimessage"}]
