Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can define the `timezone_bumper` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    if !isdate(dt)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be a DateTime, not just a Date.\"))\n    end\n    return dt + Duration(bump, Unitful.Hour)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes two arguments: `dt`, which should be a `DateTime` object, and `bump`, which is an integer representing the number of hours to add (defaulting to 3 hours). If you pass in a `Date` object instead of a `DateTime`, it will throw an `ArgumentError`.\n\nTo use this function, simply call it with your `DateTime` object and the number of hours you want to bump by:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\n# Example usage\ndt = DateTime(2023, 1, 1, 12)  # Some initial timestamp\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, 5)  # Bump the time by 5 hours\nprintln(bumped_dt)  # Output: 2023-01-01T17:00:00\n```\n\nThis will output a new `DateTime` object that is 5 hours after the original timestamp.","status":200,"tokens":[0,318],"elapsed":24.640054823,"_type":"aimessage"}]
