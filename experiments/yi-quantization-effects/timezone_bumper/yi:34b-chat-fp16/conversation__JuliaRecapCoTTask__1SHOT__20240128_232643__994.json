[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    if typeof(bump) != Int\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"`bump` must be an integer.\"))\n    end\n    new_date = Date(dt) + Dates.Day(bump * 24)\n    new_time = Time(dt) + Hours(bump)\n    return DateTime(new_date, new_time)\nend\n```\n\nThis function ensures that the input `dt` is a `DateTime` type and then adds either 3 hours (default) or any other integer number of hours specified by `bump` to the time part of the timestamp. The date part is adjusted accordingly to maintain the correct day based on the total number of hours added.\n\nThe function first checks if `bump` is an integer, throwing an error if it isn't. It then calculates a new date by adding the specified number of days (each day has 24 hours) and a new time by adding the specified number of hours. Finally, it combines the new date and time to create a new `DateTime` object.\n\nThis function adheres to the provided guidelines:\n- It uses the standard Julia library for handling dates and times (`Dates`).\n- It is type-stable, using general type annotations where possible.\n- It performs the necessary checks and throws an error if the input is not a `DateTime` type.\n- The function is clear and concise, leveraging multiple dispatch as needed within the standard library.","status":200,"tokens":[0,342],"elapsed":26.674170707,"_type":"aimessage"}]
