It then increases the timestamp of the `DateTime` by `bump` hours using the `Dates.Hour` type, which is a constructor for time intervals in Julia's date-time system. If you try to pass a `Date` object, an error will be thrown as specified.","status":200,"tokens":[75,173],"elapsed":14.512217171,"_type":"aimessage"}]
