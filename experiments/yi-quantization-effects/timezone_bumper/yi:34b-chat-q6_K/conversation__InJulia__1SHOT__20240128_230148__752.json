Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can implement the `timezone_bumper` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    # Check if dt is a DateTime type\n    if typeof(dt) == DateTime\n        # Increase the datetime by the specified number of hours\n        return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\n    else\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"The argument must be a DateTime, not a $typeof(dt)\"))\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function accepts a `DateTime` object and an optional `Int` value for the time zone bump. If no bump is specified, it defaults to adding 3 hours. The function checks the type of the `dt` argument and ensures that it's a `DateTime` before performing the operation. If the input is not a `DateTime`, it throws an `ArgumentError` with a message indicating the expected type.\n\nTo use this function, you can simply call it with your `DateTime` object:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\n# Example DateTime\ndt = DateTime(2023, 1, 1, 12, 0)  # e.g., January 1st, 2023, 12:00 PM\nbump_hours = 5  # Adjust the time zone by 5 hours\n\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, bump_hours)\nprintln(\"The new DateTime is: $new_dt\")\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nThe new DateTime is: 2023-01-01T17:00:00\n```\n\nNote that the function only supports `DateTime` types and does not handle edge cases such as dates that are moved into different months or years due to the time zone bump. It's also important to ensure that the resulting timestamp remains within the same calendar day, as otherwise, it would require adjusting the date component as well.","status":200,"tokens":[0,448],"elapsed":16.65689418,"_type":"aimessage"}]
