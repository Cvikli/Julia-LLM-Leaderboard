If no `bump` is provided, it defaults to 3 hours. It first converts the `DateTime` to a `Time` object so that we can adjust just the hour value. Then it adds or subtracts the number of hours as needed to keep the time within the 0-23 range. Finally, it converts back to a `DateTime` with the adjusted hour.\n\nTo ensure this function works only for `DateTime` types and throws an error for `Date` types, you can add some type checks:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    # Check if dt is of the correct type\n    if !isa(dt, DateTime)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"dt must be a DateTime, not a $typeof(dt).\"))\n    end\n    \n    # Convert the DateTime to a Time object so we can adjust the hour value\n    time = Time(dt)\n    \n    # ...rest of the function as above...\nend\n```\n\nThis will ensure that `timezone_bumper` only works with `DateTime` objects and will throw an error if a `Date` (or any other type) is passed in.","status":200,"tokens":[0,462],"elapsed":17.17455063,"_type":"aimessage"}]
