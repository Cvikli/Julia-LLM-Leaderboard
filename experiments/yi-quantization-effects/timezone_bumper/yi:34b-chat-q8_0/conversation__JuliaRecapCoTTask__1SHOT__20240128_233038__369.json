[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Given the task and special instructions, here's a function that bumps a `DateTime` by a specified number of hours:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    if typeof(dt) == Date\n        error(\"timezone_bumper can only be used with DateTime types, not Date.\")\n    end\n    return dt + Duration(bump * 60 * 60) # Convert hours to seconds (1 hour = 3600 secs)\nend\n```\n\nThis function checks if the input `dt` is a `Date` type and throws an error if so. It then adds the specified number of hours to the `DateTime` using `Duration`, which represents a period of time without a date component.\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes that the local timezone is already applied to the `DateTime`. If you need to account for different timezones, you would need to use a TimeZones.jl package or similar. However, since the task specifies only working with `DateTime` types, I've kept it simple by assuming the input is in the local timezone and does not require any additional timezone handling.","status":200,"tokens":[0,266],"elapsed":12.061853159,"_type":"aimessage"}]
