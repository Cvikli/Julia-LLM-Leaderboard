Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can create a custom function that adjusts the time of a `DateTime` object by a specified number of hours. Here's how you can implement the `timezone_bumper` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    if !(isa(dt, DateTime))\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be a DateTime\"))\n    end\n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes two arguments: `dt` which is a `DateTime` object, and `bump` which is an optional integer specifying the number of hours to add (defaulting to 3 hours). It then checks if the input `dt` is indeed a `DateTime` using the `isa` function, which verifies that the type of the argument matches the expected type. If not, it throws an `ArgumentError` with a custom message.\n\nThe `timezone_bumper` function uses the `Dates.Hour` construct to represent hours as a unit of time in the return statement. This ensures that the result is also a `DateTime` object, which is what we expect.\n\nTo test this function, you can use it with both `DateTime` and `Date` types to ensure it works as expected:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\n# Some sample dates and times\ndt1 = DateTime(2023, 1, 1, 12)  # A DateTime object\ndate_only = Date(2023, 1, 1)    # A Date object\n\n# Bump the time by 5 hours\nnew_time = timezone_bumper(dt1, 5)\n\n# This should throw an error since Date type is not supported\ntry\n    new_date = timezone_bumper(date_only, 5)\n    println(\"This shouldn't happen!\")\ncatch e\n    if e isa ArgumentError\n        println(\"Caught expected error: \", e.msg)\n    else\n        rethrow()  # If it's not the right type of error, re-raise it\n    end\nend\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, you should see that `new_time` is adjusted by 5 hours, and an error is thrown when trying to adjust a `Date` object.","status":200,"tokens":[0,533],"elapsed":16.981832864,"_type":"aimessage"}]
