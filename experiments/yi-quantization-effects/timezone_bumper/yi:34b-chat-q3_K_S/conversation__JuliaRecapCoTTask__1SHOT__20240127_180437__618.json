[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    if isnan(bump) || bump < 0\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"`bump` must be a positive number of hours; received $bump\"))\n    end\n    return DateTime(Int64(dt.time + Dates.Hour(bump * 24)), Int64(dt.zone))\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a `DateTime` object `dt` and an optional integer `bump` representing the number of hours to increase the timestamp by (defaulting to 3 hours). It then checks if `bump` is NaN or negative; if so, it throws an `ArgumentError`. Finally, it returns a new `DateTime` object with the updated time component incremented by `bump` hours and the same time zone information as the original `dt`.\n\nThe function works only on `DateTime` types to ensure that both the date and time components are preserved accurately. The `Dates.Hour(bump * 24)` is used to convert the number of hours into a TimeType that can be added to the `time` component of the `DateTime` object, and then converted back into an integer for precision.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the time zone information in the `DateTime` object is correct and does not adjust for daylight saving or any other time zone transitions. It simply adds the specified number of hours to the time component without altering the date.","status":200,"tokens":[0,336],"elapsed":9.070551882,"_type":"aimessage"}]
