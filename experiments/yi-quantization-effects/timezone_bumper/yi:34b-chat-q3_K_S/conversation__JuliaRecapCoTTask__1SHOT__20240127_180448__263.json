[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

If `bump` is not provided, it defaults to adding 3 hours. It returns a new `DateTime` object with the specified timezone adjustment.\n\nThe `Duration` constructor from the Julia base library is used to create a duration representing the number of hours given by `bump`. The `+` operator is then used to add this duration to the original timestamp `dt`, resulting in a new timestamp that is adjusted accordingly.\n\nIf someone tries to pass a `Date` instead of a `DateTime`, an error will be thrown because the `Duration` object cannot be added to a `Date` directly; it must be a `DateTime` so that the time component can also be adjusted.\n\nPlease note that this function does not take into account daylight saving time or any other complexities regarding timezones. It simply adds the specified number of hours to the timestamp provided.","status":200,"tokens":[0,252],"elapsed":6.79057887,"_type":"aimessage"}]
