[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

This check ensures that we are dealing with a TimeType and not a DateType.\n- If the input is indeed a DateType, an ArgumentError is thrown with an appropriate message.\n- The time component of the DateTime is increased by `bump` hours using `TimeType(dt) + Dates.Hour(bump)`. This assumes that `dt` is a TimeType and does not change its type to DateType even if it was passed in as such.\n- Finally, the resulting DateTime is returned with the local time zone applied.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that `dt` is already in UTC or can be meaningfully increased by an offset without changing its type to a DateType.","status":200,"tokens":[0,395],"elapsed":11.101334102,"_type":"aimessage"}]
