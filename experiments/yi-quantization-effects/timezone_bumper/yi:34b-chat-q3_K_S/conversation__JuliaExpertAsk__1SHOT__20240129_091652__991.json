Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    return dt + Dates.Second((bump * 60 * 60))  # Convert hours to seconds\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a `DateTime` object and an integer `bump` specifying the number of hours to add. If `bump` is not provided, it defaults to adding 3 hours. It then converts the timezone bump from hours to seconds using the `Dates.Second()` constructor with multiplication to perform the conversion, and finally returns the new timestamp.\n\nThis function does not accept `Date` types as input because `DateTime` has both date and time information, while `Date` lacks the latter. If you try to pass a `Date` object to this function, Julia's type system will prevent it at compile-time with an error like:\n\n```plaintext\nERROR: MethodError: Cannot `convert` an object of type Date to an object of type DateTime\n```\n\nIf you want the function to handle both cases explicitly, you would need to write separate logic for each input type or use pattern matching as follows:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    return dt + Dates.Second((bump * 60 * 60))  # Convert hours to seconds\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int = 3)\n    throw(DomainError(\"Cannot add timezone bump to Date objects\"))\nend\n```\n\nThis second version of the function includes an explicit `throw` statement to handle the case where someone tries to add a timezone bump to a date without a timestamp.","status":200,"tokens":[0,383],"elapsed":10.58969268,"_type":"aimessage"}]
