If no `bump` is provided, it bumps by 3 hours by default. It ensures that the new time does not result in a negative or exceedingly large value (greater than 24 hours away from the original time) and then returns the new `DateTime` with the bumped time.","status":200,"tokens":[114,277],"elapsed":12.771347366,"_type":"aimessage"}]
