Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the definition of a Julia function named `timezone_bumper` that increases the time component of a `DateTime` by `bump` hours, where `bump` defaults to 3 hours if not provided:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    # Check if dt is a Date type and throw an error\n    if isa(dt, Date)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"timezone_bumper can only operate on DateTime types, not Date types\"))\n    end\n\n    # Calculate the new time by adding bump hours\n    new_time = LocalTime(dt) + Hour(bump)\n\n    # Construct a new DateTime from the existing date and the new time\n    return DateTime(Date(dt), new_time)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if `dt` is of type `Date`. If it is, an `ArgumentError` is thrown indicating that the function can only operate on `DateTime` types. It then adds `bump` hours to the local time part of the `DateTime` using `LocalTime(dt) + Hour(bump)`. Finally, a new `DateTime` is constructed with the date from the original `DateTime` and the updated time.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes you are working in the local time zone and does not account for daylight saving time or other complexities of time zones. If you need to handle different time zones, you should use a library like TimeZones.jl which provides more sophisticated handling of time zones in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[0,345],"elapsed":9.105959683,"_type":"aimessage"}]
