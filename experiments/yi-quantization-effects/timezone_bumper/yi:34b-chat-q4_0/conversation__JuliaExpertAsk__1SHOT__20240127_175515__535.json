Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    # Check if dt is a Date type and throw an error if so\n    if !isa(dt, DateTime)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"timezone_bumper can only be applied to DateTime types, not $(typeof(dt))\"))\n    end\n    \n    # Adjust the time by bumping the hour value\n    new_hour = mod1(hour(dt) + bump, 24)\n    return DateTime(year(dt), month(dt), day(dt), new_hour, minute(dt), second(dt))\nend\n```\n\nThis function `timezone_bumper` takes a `DateTime` object `dt` and an optional integer `bump` representing the number of hours to add. If no `bump` is provided, it defaults to adding 3 hours. The function ensures that the result has the correct year, month, day, hour, minute, and second values after applying the bump. It also handles the case where the new hour value wraps around to the next day by using the `mod1()` function to keep the value between 0 and 23.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the function:\n\n```julia\njulia> dt = DateTime(2023, 1, 1, 12, 30, 45);\n\njulia> timezone_bumper(dt)\n2023-01-01T15:30:45\n\njulia> timezone_bumper(dt, -6)\n2023-01-01T06:30:45\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,390],"elapsed":10.323643976,"_type":"aimessage"}]
