Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can create a function `timezone_bumper` that advances a `DateTime` value by a specified number of hours. Here's how you might implement this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    if !ismissing(dt) && isa(dt, DateTime)\n        local new_time = Dates.UTInstant(Dates.unix2datetime(floor(Int, Dates.timestamp(dt)))) + Second(bump * 3600)\n        return DateTime(new_time)\n    else\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Timestamp must be a non-missing DateTime value. Received: $dt\"))\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes two arguments: `dt`, which is the `DateTime` to bump by some number of hours, and `bump`, which is an optional integer specifying the number of hours to add (defaults to 3). It then advances the time by `bump` hours using a `UTInstant` to ensure proper handling of leap seconds.\n\nTo make sure it works only for `DateTime` types and throws an error for `Date` types, we can modify the function like so:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Union{Date, DateTime}, bump::Int = 3)\n    if isa(dt, Date)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Cannot increase a Date by hours. Received: $dt\"))\n    end\n    return timezone_bumper(DateTime(dt), bump)\nend\n```\n\nNow when you call `timezone_bumper` with a `Date` type, it will throw an error as expected. The function first checks if the input is a `Date` and if so, throws an error. It then calls the original `timezone_bumper` function we defined above to handle the case where `dt` is a `DateTime`.\n\nRemember that in Julia, you should always check for missing values when working with dates and times, which is why the first line of the inner `timezone_bumper` function includes a check for `ismissing(dt)`.","status":200,"tokens":[75,492],"elapsed":18.572970145,"_type":"aimessage"}]
