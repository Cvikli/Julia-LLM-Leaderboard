If both conditions are met, it increases the time portion of the timestamp by adding `bump` hours using `unix2datetime()` from the Julia Dates package to ensure that the date part remains unchanged. If either condition is not met, an error is thrown.","status":200,"tokens":[0,196],"elapsed":5.280381843,"_type":"aimessage"}]
