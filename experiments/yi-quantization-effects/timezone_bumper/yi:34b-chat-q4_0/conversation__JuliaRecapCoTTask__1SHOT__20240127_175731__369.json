[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

It takes a `DateTime` object as input and an optional integer argument for the number of hours to bump.\n2. By default, it adds 3 hours if no explicit value is provided for the `bump` parameter.\n3. It converts the `DateTime` into its time component using `Date(dt)` and then adds the desired number of hours with a `Duration` object.\n4. To ensure that the new time does not cause a date change, it checks if the resulting time is within one day (24 hours) of the original time. If it's not, a `DomainError` is thrown with an appropriate message.\n5. Finally, it returns the new `DateTime` object.\n\nThe function is designed to work only with `DateTime` types and will throw an error if a `Date` type is provided.","status":200,"tokens":[0,411],"elapsed":11.067914246,"_type":"aimessage"}]
