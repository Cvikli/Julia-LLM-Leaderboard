Here's an example of how you can write the `count_model_rows` function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped_models = groupby(df, :model) # Group rows by model column\n    counts = map(g -> size(g)[1], grouped_models) # Calculate the number of rows for each model\n    return counts\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ndf_cars = ... # Your DataFrame with a `model` column\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThe `groupby` function returns a tuple containing the grouped data and a vector of row groups indices. We're only interested in the grouped data, so we use `map` to apply `size` to each group to get the number of rows for that group. The `size` method with one argument returns the size of an array or a DataFrame as a tuple with the number of rows and columns; we ignore the second part since we don't want the number of columns, only the number of rows per model.\n\nPlease note that you need to have your `df_cars` DataFrame already loaded into the workspace for the example usage to work. The `...` is just a placeholder for the code that would be omitted here because it assumes that you've already read your data into a `DataFrame` named `df_cars` with a `model` column.","status":200,"tokens":[0,370],"elapsed":9.826763778,"_type":"aimessage"}]
