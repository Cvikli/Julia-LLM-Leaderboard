It then returns a dictionary where the keys are the distinct models and the values are the corresponding row counts.\n\nTo use this function with your existing `DataFrame` `df_cars`, simply call the function:\n\n```julia\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThis will give you a dictionary where each model is mapped to its respective row count.\n\nIf you have any other columns in your `DataFrame` that you want to preserve when grouping, you would need to add those columns to the group key by including them in the anonymous function passed to `eachrow` or by modifying the function signature to accept a vector of column names to include in the group key.","status":200,"tokens":[0,312],"elapsed":8.25595209,"_type":"aimessage"}]
