It uses the `groupby` function to group the data by the `:model` column and then `combine` to calculate the length (number of rows) for each group. The resulting `DataFrame` will have two columns: `:model` and `:counts`, where `:counts` contains the number of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,149],"elapsed":3.935418248,"_type":"aimessage"}]
