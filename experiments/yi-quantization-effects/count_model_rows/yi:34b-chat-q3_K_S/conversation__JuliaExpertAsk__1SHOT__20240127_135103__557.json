It groups the data by the `model` and then calculates the number of rows for each group using `mapreduce` with an initial value of 0 to accumulate the row counts. The inner function `x -> length(x)` returns the number of rows in each group, and `+` is used as the reduction operator to sum up these numbers.","status":200,"tokens":[0,157],"elapsed":4.143419826,"_type":"aimessage"}]
