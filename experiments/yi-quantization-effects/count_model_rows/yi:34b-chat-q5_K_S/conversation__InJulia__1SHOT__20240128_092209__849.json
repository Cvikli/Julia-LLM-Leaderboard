If your `DataFrame` is already loaded into a variable named `df_cars`, you can simply call the function as shown at the end of the example.\n\nThe `groupby` function returns a grouped `DataFrame` where each group is a DataFrame with all rows that have the same unique value for the grouping key(s). In this case, we're grouping by the `model` column. Then, we use `combine` to apply a reduction operation (in this case, counting the number of rows using `length`) on each group and return the result as a new DataFrame with one row per group.\n\nThe resulting DataFrame will have a single column containing the counts for each unique model. If you want to preserve the original order of the models in your output, you can add an extra step to sort the data by the grouping key:\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    # Group the data by the 'model' column and get the counts of rows for each group\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = combine(grouped, : => length)\n\n    # Sort the results to preserve the original order of models\n    sort!(counts, :model)\n\n    return counts\nend\n```\n\nThis will ensure that the output DataFrame is sorted by the `model` column, which is useful if you want to maintain a specific ordering in your report or visualization.","status":200,"tokens":[58,544],"elapsed":17.489349156,"_type":"aimessage"}]
