The example above shows how to create a `DataFrame` from a hypothetical CSV file and then use the `count_model_rows` function to count the number of rows for each model.\n\nIf your actual dataset is larger or more complex, you might need to adjust the `groupby` and `mapreduce` operations accordingly. The `groupby` function returns a group object, and `eachrow(grouped)` iterates over that object, allowing you to perform calculations on each group. In this case, we're just counting the number of rows in each group.\n\nRemember to replace \"path/to/file.csv\" with the actual path to your CSV file if you're using a real dataset. If you have the data in memory or as an array, you can construct the `DataFrame` accordingly before calling the `count_model_rows` function.","status":200,"tokens":[211,369],"elapsed":18.782184791,"_type":"aimessage"}]
