To use this function with your `df_cars` DataFrame, you would call it as follows:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\n# Example DataFrame\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model = [\"Car A\", \"Car B\", \"Car C\", \"Car A\"], # Assuming there's a `model` column\n                    # .. and possibly other columns...\n                   )\n\n# Call the function\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThe `counts` variable will now contain a dictionary with the counts for each model in the DataFrame:\n\n```julia\nDict{String, Int64} with 3 entries:\n  \"Car A\" => 2\n  \"Car B\" => 1\n  \"Car C\" => 1\n```\n\nIf you want to include other columns or perform more complex operations on the DataFrame, you can modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,349],"elapsed":10.078108869,"_type":"aimessage"}]
