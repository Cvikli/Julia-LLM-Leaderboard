Here's an example of such a function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return groupby(df, :model) |> g -> length(g)\nend\n\n# Example usage with a DataFrame named df_cars\nmodels_count = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThis function takes a `DataFrame` as input and returns a vector where each element is the number of rows for a given model. The `groupby` function groups the data by the specified column, in this case, `:model`, and then we use the `length` function to get the length of each group.\n\nNote that you need to import the `Statistics` package at the beginning because the `length` function is defined within that package. The pipe operator (`|>`) is used to pass the grouped data to the `length` function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,239],"elapsed":6.877896682,"_type":"aimessage"}]
