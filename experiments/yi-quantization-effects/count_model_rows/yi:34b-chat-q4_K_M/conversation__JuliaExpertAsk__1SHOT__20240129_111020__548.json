Then it uses `mapreduce` to iterate over each group and sum up the number of rows for each model. The `identity` function is used as the initial value for `mapreduce`, which in this case is just the length of the group. Finally, `length(g)` returns the number of rows in each group, and `+` is used to accumulate these counts into a single vector of counts for all models.","status":200,"tokens":[0,188],"elapsed":5.404973919,"_type":"aimessage"}]
