The `nrow` function is used to get the row count, and `=>` is a higher-order function that applies the given function to the first element of the result from `nrow`. Finally, `x -> x[1]` selects the first (and only) element of the result, which is the count for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,179],"elapsed":5.149438666,"_type":"aimessage"}]
