Then it calculates the number of rows for each group using a comprehension. Finally, it creates a new `Series` with the counts as values and the unique models as indices. The resulting Series can be used to access the count of rows for any given model.","status":200,"tokens":[88,190],"elapsed":5.529084414,"_type":"aimessage"}]
