Here's an example of how you might write such a function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped_models = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = Dict()\n    for model in unique(df.model)\n        rows_per_model = length(filter(row -> row[:model] == model, df))\n        counts[model] = rows_per_model\n    end\n    return counts\nend\n\n# Example usage with a hypothetical DataFrame `df_cars`\ndf_cars = # Your actual dataframe\nmodel_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(\"Number of rows for each model:\")\nfor (model, count) in model_counts\n    println(\"$model: $count rows\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a `DataFrame` as input, groups it by the `model` column, and then calculates the number of rows for each unique model. It returns a `Dict` where the keys are the models and the values are the counts of the corresponding rows.\n\nMake sure to replace `df_cars = # Your actual dataframe` with your actual DataFrame. If you have already imported the DataFrames package, you can use the function as shown above. If not, import it at the beginning of your script using `using DataFrames` before defining and calling the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,375],"elapsed":10.830878261,"_type":"aimessage"}]
