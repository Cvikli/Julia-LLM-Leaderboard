Then, we iterate over each unique model in the grouped DataFrame and filter for rows where the `model` equals the current model. Finally, we count the number of rows for each model and store them in a dictionary.\n\nPlease replace `df_cars = # Your data here` with your actual `DataFrame` object containing the `model` column. If you have any other columns in your DataFrame that you want to keep track of, you can add them as additional arguments to the function or include them in the filter operation.","status":200,"tokens":[0,356],"elapsed":10.08031342,"_type":"aimessage"}]
