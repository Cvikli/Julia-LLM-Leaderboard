It then iterates over the unique models and retrieves the first row of each group (which should be representative of the group) to count the number of rows for each model. Finally, it returns a dictionary where the keys are the unique models and the values are the counts of how many rows they have.","status":200,"tokens":[0,188],"elapsed":6.955179176,"_type":"aimessage"}]
