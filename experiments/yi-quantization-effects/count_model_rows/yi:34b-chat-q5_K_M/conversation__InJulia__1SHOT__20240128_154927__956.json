Here's how you can define the `count_model_rows` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = Dict()\n    for model in unique(df.model)\n        if !ismissing(model) # If the model is not missing\n            this_row_count = length(filter(row -> row[:model] == model, df))\n            counts[model] = this_row_count\n        end\n    end\n    return counts\nend\n```\n\nThis function groups the DataFrame `df` by the `model` column and then iterates over each unique `model`. For each `model`, it uses `filter` to filter the rows where `model` matches the current `model` and then calculates the length of that subset using `length`. The result is a dictionary where the keys are the unique models and the values are the counts of how many rows there are for each model.\n\nTo use this function, you would simply call it with your DataFrame as an argument:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = # Your dataframe with a 'model' column\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThis will return a dictionary where the keys are the unique models and the values are the counts of how many times each model appears in the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[58,362],"elapsed":11.93119595,"_type":"aimessage"}]
