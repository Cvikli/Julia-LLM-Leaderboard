It then calculates the number of rows for each group using `mapreduce` with `+` to sum the row counts from each group. Finally, it returns a dictionary where the keys are the grouped models and the values are their respective row counts.","status":200,"tokens":[0,184],"elapsed":5.969670232,"_type":"aimessage"}]
