Then, `collect` is applied to convert the grouped rows into a vector of RowIndices, which is then passed to a anonymous function `r -> r.rowCount` to get the number of rows for each model.\n\nPlease note that you need to replace `# Your actual DataFrame with a 'model' column` with your actual DataFrame named `df_cars` and make sure it has a column called `model`. The function will return a vector where each element is the count of rows for a given model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,275],"elapsed":8.92809254,"_type":"aimessage"}]
