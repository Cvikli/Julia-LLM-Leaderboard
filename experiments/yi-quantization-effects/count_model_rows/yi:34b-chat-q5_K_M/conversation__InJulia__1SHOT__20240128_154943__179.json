Then it iterates over each unique model and filters the DataFrame to get only the rows with that model. Finally, it counts the number of rows for each model and stores them in a dictionary.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes there is a column named `model` in the DataFrame. If your DataFrame has a different name for the relevant column, you should replace `:model` with the actual column name in the code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,483],"elapsed":15.734736868,"_type":"aimessage"}]
