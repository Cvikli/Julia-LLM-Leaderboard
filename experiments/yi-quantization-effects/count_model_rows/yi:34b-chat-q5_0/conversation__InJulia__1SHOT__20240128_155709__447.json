The `groupby` function groups the data by the specified column, and then we iterate over each group to calculate the number of rows for that model using `length`. We store these counts in a dictionary where the keys are the unique models and the values are the counts. Finally, we print out the results in a tabular format.\n\nMake sure you have imported the `DataFrames` package at the beginning if you haven't already.","status":200,"tokens":[0,355],"elapsed":11.258153232,"_type":"aimessage"}]
