The following function will return a `DataFrame` where each row represents a unique model with its count:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return combine(groupby(df, :model), nrow => :count)\nend\n\n# Example usage with a hypothetical `df_cars`\ndf_cars = ... # Your DataFrame here\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nIn this function:\n\n- `groupby(df, :model)` groups the data by the `model` column.\n- `combine(grouped_data, nrow => :count)` takes each group and combines it into a single row, where the count of rows in that group is stored in a new column named \"count\". The `nrow` function is used to get the number of rows in each group, and then `combine` is used to create a new DataFrame with this aggregated value as a column.\n\nMake sure to replace `... # Your DataFrame here` with your actual `df_cars` DataFrame in the example usage.","status":200,"tokens":[0,307],"elapsed":23.784889905,"_type":"aimessage"}]
