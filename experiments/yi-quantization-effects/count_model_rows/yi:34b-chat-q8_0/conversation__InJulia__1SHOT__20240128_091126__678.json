In Julia, you can use the built-in `groupby` function from the DataFrames package to group your DataFrame by a specific column and then count the number of rows in each group using the `count` function. Here's how you can define the `count_model_rows` function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = map(eachrow(grouped)) do g\n        return (; model=g.model[1], count=length(g))\n    end\n    return counts |> DataFrame\nend\n\n# Example usage with a hypothetical `df_cars` DataFrame\ndf_cars = # Your actual data here\nprintln(\"Number of rows per model:\")\ndisplay(count_model_rows(df_cars))\n```\n\nThis function takes a `DataFrame` as input, groups it by the `model` column, and then creates a new DataFrame where each row contains the model name and the count of rows for that model.\n\nMake sure to replace `# Your actual data here` with your actual `df_cars` DataFrame containing the `model` column. The `println` statement is used to print out a message, and `display` is used to pretty-print the output DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,304],"elapsed":13.629366328,"_type":"aimessage"}]
