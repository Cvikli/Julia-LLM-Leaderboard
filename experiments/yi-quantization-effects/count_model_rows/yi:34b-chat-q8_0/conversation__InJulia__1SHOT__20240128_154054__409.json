Here's an example of how you might define such a function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = map(groups -> length(groups), grouped)\n    return counts\nend\n\n# Example usage with a hypothetical df_cars DataFrame\ndf_cars = ... # Your actual data here\nmodel_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nIn this function:\n\n- `groupby(df, :model)` groups the rows of the DataFrame `df` by the value of the `:model` column.\n- `map(groups -> length(groups), grouped)` applies the `length` function to each group in the grouped collection returned by `groupby`. This gives you a vector with the counts for each model.\n\nMake sure to replace `... # Your actual data here` with your actual DataFrame `df_cars` containing the `model` column and any other relevant information. The function will return a vector of counts for each distinct model in the dataset.","status":200,"tokens":[58,320],"elapsed":14.505354387,"_type":"aimessage"}]
