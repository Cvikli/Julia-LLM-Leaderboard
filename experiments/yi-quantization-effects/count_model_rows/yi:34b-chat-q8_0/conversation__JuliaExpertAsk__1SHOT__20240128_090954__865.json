Finally, it filters out any groups that have no rows using the `length .> 0` operation, which applies the `>` function element-wise to the vector of lengths. The result is a vector containing the number of rows for each non-empty model group.","status":200,"tokens":[0,158],"elapsed":7.073842364,"_type":"aimessage"}]
