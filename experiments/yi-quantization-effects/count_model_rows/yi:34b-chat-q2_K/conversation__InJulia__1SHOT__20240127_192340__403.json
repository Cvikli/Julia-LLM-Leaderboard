Below is an example of how you can define the `count_model_rows` function:\n\nFirst, install the `GroupBy` package if you haven't already:\n\n```julia\nusing Pkg; Pkg.add(\"GroupBy\")\n```\n\nNow, you can write the `count_model_rows` function as follows:\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    by_model = groupby(df_cars, :model) # Group by model column\n    counts = map(by_model) do gb\n        length(gb) # Calculate the length of each group (i.e., count rows)\n    end\n    return counts\nend\n```\n\nTo use this function with your `df_cars` DataFrame, you would write:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames; # If not already imported\n\n# Assuming df_cars is a DataFrame with a 'model' column\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThe `counts` variable will now be a vector containing the number of rows for each unique model. If you have other columns in your DataFrame, `count_model_rows` will only give you the counts for the grouping column specified (`:model` in this case).","status":200,"tokens":[0,332],"elapsed":8.505602742,"_type":"aimessage"}]
