It then calculates how many rows there are for each group using the `nrow` function provided by DataFrames. The result is another `DataFrame` with a new column named `count` that contains the row counts for each model. Finally, it sorts the resulting DataFrame to ensure that models with fewer occurrences appear first in the output.","status":200,"tokens":[0,156],"elapsed":3.988289453,"_type":"aimessage"}]
