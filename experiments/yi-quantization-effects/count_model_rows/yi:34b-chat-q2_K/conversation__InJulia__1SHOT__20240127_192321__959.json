The resulting DataFrame will have two columns: `Model` which contains unique model names, and `Count` which contains the number of occurrences of each model name in the original DataFrame.\n\nIf you want to include only distinct models and their counts without any other columns from the original DataFrame, you can use the following simplified function:\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped_models = by(df, :model) do model\n        return (Model=model, Count=length(model))\n    end |> filter(:Count .!= 0)\n    return grouped_models\nend\n```\n\nThis will ensure that only models with a non-zero count are included in the output DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,342],"elapsed":8.772867545,"_type":"aimessage"}]
