Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that meets your requirements:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    diffs = diff(sort(temps))\n    trend = if all(diffs .>= 0)\n        :increasing\n    elseif all(diffs .<= 0)\n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=average_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty and returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing` if it is. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package. Then, it calculates the trend by sorting the temperatures and computing the differences between consecutive elements. If all differences are non-negative, the trend is set to `:increasing`; if all differences are non-positive, the trend is set to `:decreasing`; otherwise, the trend is set to `:stable`. Finally, it returns a named tuple containing the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[192,341],"elapsed":7.535107916,"_type":"aimessage"}]
