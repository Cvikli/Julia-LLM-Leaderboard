Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a solution that matches your requirements:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    diffs = diff(sort(temps))\n    trend = if all(x >= 0 for x in diffs)\n        :increasing\n    elseif all(x <= 0 for x in diffs)\n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=average_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average, max, and min temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package. The trend is determined by sorting the list and calculating the differences between consecutive elements. If all differences are positive, the trend is set to `:increasing`. If all differences are negative, the trend is set to `:decreasing`. Otherwise, the trend is set to `:stable`.","status":200,"tokens":[192,327],"elapsed":7.140821375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
