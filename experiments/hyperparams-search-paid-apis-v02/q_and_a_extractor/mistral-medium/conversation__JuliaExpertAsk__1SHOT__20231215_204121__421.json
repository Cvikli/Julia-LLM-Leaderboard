The `(?s)` flag makes the `.` character match newlines as well. The `(?=...)` pattern is a positive lookahead that matches the text following the current match without including it in the match. The `strip` function is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the extracted text.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the \"Question\" section comes before the \"Answer\" section and that there is only one \"Question\" and one \"Answer\" section in the markdown text. If there are multiple \"Question\" and \"Answer\" sections, you may need to modify the regular expressions to handle them.","status":200,"tokens":[136,375],"elapsed":27.568861541,"_type":"aimessage"}]
