Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a potential implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function using regular expressions:\n```\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Match Julia code blocks\n    matches = eachmatch(r\"\\`\\`\\`julia([\\s\\S]*?)\\`\\`\\`\", md)\n    \n    # Extract code blocks and join with newlines\n    code = join([match.captures[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Remove leading and trailing whitespace\n    return strip(code)\nend\n```\nThis function first uses the `eachmatch` function from the `Regex` module to find all matches of the regular expression `\\`\\`\\`julia([\\s\\S]*?)\\`\\`\\``, which matches Julia code blocks surrounded by triple backticks (`````). The `([\\s\\S]*?)` part of the regular expression captures all characters between the code fences, including whitespace and newlines.\n\nNext, the function extracts the captured code blocks using the `match.captures` property, which returns a vector of the captured substring. It then joins the code blocks together with newlines and removes any leading or trailing whitespace using the `strip` function.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input string `md` contains valid Markdown syntax and that the Julia code blocks are well-formed. If this is not the case, the function may not work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[126,334],"elapsed":7.47190475,"_type":"aimessage"}]
