Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution for the function `extract_julia_code`:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    blocks = eachmatch(r\"```\\n(?:(?!\\n```)\\s*.*\\n?)*\\s*```\", md)\n    code = join([match.match[2:end-2] for match in blocks], \"\\n\")\n    return strip(code)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Regex` module to match and extract Julia code blocks from the markdown string using a regular expression patterns. The `extract_julia_code` function returns a string containing all the Julia code blocks with the code fences removed and concatenated together with a newline separator. The final returned string is also stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n\nHere's an explanation of the regular expression pattern used:\n\n* `\"`\"``: matches three consecutive backticks, which indicate the beginning of a code fence in Markdown.\n* `\\n`: matches a newline character, which separates the code fence from the actual code block.\n* `(?:(?!\\n```)\\s*.*\\n?)*`: matches zero or more lines of code, where each line is optional and may contain any number of whitespace characters followed by any number of non-whitespace characters. This pattern ensures that the function correctly handles code blocks that contain nested code fences.\n* `\\s*````: matches any number of whitespace characters followed by three consecutive backticks, which indicate the end of a code fence in Markdown.\n* The `join` function is used to concatenate all the extracted code blocks together with a newline separator.\n* The `strip` function is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the final returned string.","status":200,"tokens":[126,405],"elapsed":8.932544542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
