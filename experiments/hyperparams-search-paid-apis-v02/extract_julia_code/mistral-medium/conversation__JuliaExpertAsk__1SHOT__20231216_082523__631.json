Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    # Match Julia code blocks using a regular expression\n    code_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s, md)\n\n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline character\n    return join(map(s -> strip(s), code_blocks), \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `Regex` module to match Julia code blocks in the markdown document. The regular expression `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s` matches any text that is enclosed between triple backticks (`````) followed by the word `julia`, and ends with triple backticks. The `(.*?)` captures the code block content, and the `s` flag at the end of the regular expression makes the `.` character match newlines as well.\n\nThe `matchall` function returns an array of all matches found in the markdown document. The `map` function is then used to apply the `strip` function to each code block, which removes any leading or trailing whitespace. Finally, the `join` function concatenates all the code blocks together with a newline character.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the markdown document only contains Julia code blocks, and that there are no nested code blocks. If these assumptions do not hold, the regular expression and the extraction logic may need to be modified accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[126,350],"elapsed":7.707001,"_type":"aimessage"}]
