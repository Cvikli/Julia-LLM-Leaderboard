Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution using regular expressions to extract the Julia code blocks from the markdown document:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Match triple-backticked Julia code blocks\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n((.|\\n)*?)\\n```\"\n    matches = eachmatch(pattern, md)\n\n    # Extract the code and join with newlines\n    code_blocks = [match.captures[1] for match in matches]\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `eachmatch` function from the `Regex` module to find all matches of the pattern in the input markdown string. The pattern matches triple-backticked Julia code blocks, capturing the code itself (excluding the fences) in the first capture group. The code blocks are then extracted from the matches using a comprehension, and joined together with newlines using the `join` function.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the input markdown string is well-formed and contains valid Julia code blocks. If the input may contain malformed code blocks or other unexpected content, additional error handling may be necessary.","status":200,"tokens":[126,275],"elapsed":6.06063275,"_type":"aimessage"}]
