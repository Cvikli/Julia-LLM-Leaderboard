Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    # Match Julia code blocks between triple backticks\n    code_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s, md)\n    # Remove leading/trailing whitespace and join code blocks with newline\n    return join(map(s -> strip(s), code_blocks), \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `Regex` module to match Julia code blocks between triple backticks (````julia`) and extracts the code between them. It then removes any leading or trailing whitespace from each code block using the `strip` function and joins them together with a newline character (`\\n`). The result is a single string containing all the Julia code in the markdown document.","status":200,"tokens":[126,207],"elapsed":21.056829375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
