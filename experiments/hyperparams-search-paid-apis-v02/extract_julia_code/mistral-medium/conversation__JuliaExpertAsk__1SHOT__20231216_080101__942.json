Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the function for extracting and joining all Julia code blocks from a markdown document:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    blocks = matchall(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s, md)\n    return join(map(s -> strip(s), blocks), \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the Regex module to match all Julia code blocks with the pattern ```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```. It then maps each block, applying the `strip` function to remove any leading or trailing whitespace. Finally, it joins the cleaned code blocks into a single string with newline characters between them.","status":200,"tokens":[126,160],"elapsed":3.581654375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
