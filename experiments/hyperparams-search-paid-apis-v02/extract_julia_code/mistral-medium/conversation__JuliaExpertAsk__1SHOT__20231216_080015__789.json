Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    # Match Julia code blocks between triple backticks\n    code_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"ms, md)\n    \n    # Remove leading/trailing whitespace and join code blocks with newline\n    extracted_code = join([strip(code_block) for code_block in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return extracted_code\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `Regex` module to match Julia code blocks in the markdown document. The regular expression `\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"ms` matches any sequence of characters between triple backticks that are preceded by the string \"`julia`\". The `s` modifier at the end of the regular expression enables dot-all mode, which allows the dot character to match newlines as well.\n\nThe `matchall` function returns an array of all matches, and the code blocks are extracted from each match by capturing the first (and only) group using parentheses. The extracted code blocks are then stripped of leading and trailing whitespace using the `strip` function and joined together with a newline using the `join` function.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the markdown document is a string, and that the Julia code blocks are well-formed and do not contain any nested triple backticks. If these assumptions do not hold, additional error handling and sanitization may be necessary.","status":200,"tokens":[126,360],"elapsed":7.937705792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
