[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise. You're precise and answer only when you're confident in the high quality of your answer.","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Question\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    # Match Julia code blocks between triple backticks\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"is\n    matches = eachmatch(pattern, md)\n\n    # Extract code blocks and join them with newlines\n    code_blocks = String[]\n    for match in matches\n        push!(code_blocks, match.captures[1])\n    end\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\nThe function uses the `Regex` module to define a regular expression pattern that matches Julia code blocks between triple backticks. The `eachmatch` function is then used to iterate over all matches in the markdown document, and extract the code blocks by accessing the first capture group. Finally, the code blocks are joined together with newlines using the `join` function, and the resulting string is returned.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the markdown document only contains Julia code blocks, and does not handle other types of code blocks or markdown syntax. If the document contains other types of code blocks or markdown syntax, the regular expression pattern and capture group may need to be modified accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[126,301],"elapsed":6.648491333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
