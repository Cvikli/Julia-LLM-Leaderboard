[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise. You're precise and answer only when you're confident in the high quality of your answer.","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Question\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    # Find all code blocks that start with ```julia or ```jl\n    code_blocks = matchall(r\"(?s)```julia(.*?)```\"i, md)\n\n    # Remove the leading ```julia and trailing ```\n    cleaned_blocks = map(x -> strip(x[2:end-1]), code_blocks)\n\n    # Join the cleaned blocks with a newline\n    return join(cleaned_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis implementation uses the `Regex` module to search for Julia code blocks in the markdown document. The regular expression `r\"(?s)```julia(.*?)```\"i` is used to match all code blocks that start with either ```julia or ```jl (case-insensitive), and the `matchall` function returns a vector of all matches. Each match is then cleaned by removing the leading and trailing ``` characters, and the cleaned blocks are joined together with a newline character.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input `md` is a string containing markdown text. If `md` is a file or a URL, you may need to read the contents of the file or fetch the contents of the URL before passing it to the `extract_julia_code` function.","status":200,"tokens":[126,339],"elapsed":7.507600417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
