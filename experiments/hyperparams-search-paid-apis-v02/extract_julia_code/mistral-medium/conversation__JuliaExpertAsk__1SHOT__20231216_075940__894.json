Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    # Match Julia code blocks between triple backticks\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"is\n    matches = eachmatch(pattern, md)\n\n    # Extract and join the code blocks with newlines\n    code_blocks = [match.captures[1] for match in matches]\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `Regex` module to define a regular expression pattern that matches Julia code blocks between triple backticks. It then uses the `eachmatch` function to find all matches of this pattern in the input markdown string. For each match, it extracts the captured group containing the code block and stores it in a vector. Finally, it joins the code blocks together with newlines and returns the resulting string.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input markdown string is well-formed and contains valid Julia code blocks. If the input string is not well-formed or contains malformed code blocks, the behavior of this function is undefined.","status":200,"tokens":[126,275],"elapsed":6.103877041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
