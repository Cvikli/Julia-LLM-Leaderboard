Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Match Julia code blocks between triple backticks\n    matches = eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s, md)\n    # Extract the code and join it with newlines\n    return join([match.captures[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `eachmatch` function from the `Regex` module to find all matches of the regular expression pattern for Julia code blocks in the markdown document. The regular expression pattern matches any text between triple backticks (`````) that starts with the word `julia` followed by a newline (`\\n`). The `.*?` pattern matches any character (except for a newline) zero or more times, non-greedily. The captured text (i.e., the code block) is extracted using the `captures` property of the match object. Finally, the extracted code blocks are joined together with newlines using the `join` function.","status":200,"tokens":[126,257],"elapsed":5.680598167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
