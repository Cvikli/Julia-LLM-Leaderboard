Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Match Julia code blocks between triple backticks\n    code_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s, md)\n    \n    # Remove leading and trailing whitespace from each code block\n    cleaned_blocks = map(x -> strip(x), code_blocks)\n    \n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    return join(cleaned_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `Regex` module to match Julia code blocks between triple backticks (````julia\\n...\\n````). It then removes leading and trailing whitespace from each code block using the `strip` function and joins the cleaned blocks together with a newline using the `join` function. The resulting string contains all the Julia code from the markdown document.","status":200,"tokens":[126,230],"elapsed":9.365989417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
