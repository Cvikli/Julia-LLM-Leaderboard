Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    parsed = parse_markdown(md)\n    code_blocks = filter(x -> x.t == MDTyped.Code, parsed.content)\n    extracted_code = join([replace(x.code, r\"^```julia\\n\" => \"\", r\"\\n```$\" => \"\") for x in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n    return extracted_code\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `Markdown` package to parse the markdown document and extract the code blocks. It then filters out the code blocks that are not Julia code blocks. Next, it removes the code fences from each code block using the `replace` function and regular expressions. Finally, it joins all the extracted code blocks together with a newline character.\n\nNote that the regular expressions used to remove the code fences assume that the code fences are of the form ```julia` and ````. If the markdown document uses a different syntax for code fences, the regular expressions will need to be updated accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[126,265],"elapsed":5.920843125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
