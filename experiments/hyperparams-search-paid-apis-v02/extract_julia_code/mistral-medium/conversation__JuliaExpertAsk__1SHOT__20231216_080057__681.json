[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise.

Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    # Parse the Markdown document into an abstract syntax tree (AST)\n    ast = parse_document(md)\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to hold the extracted Julia code\n    code = \"\"\n\n    # Iterate over the elements of the AST\n    for el in ast.content\n        # Check if the element is a code block with Julia language\n        if el isa Code && el.info == \"julia\"\n            # Remove the code fences and append the code block to the `code` string\n            code *= chop(el.code) * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return the extracted Julia code\n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `Markdown` package to parse the input Markdown document into an AST, and then iterates over the elements of the AST to find code blocks with Julia language. For each such code block, it removes the code fences (i.e., triple backticks) and appends the code block to the `code` string, separated by a newline character. Finally, it returns the extracted Julia code as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[126,296],"elapsed":6.58978975,"_type":"aimessage"}]
