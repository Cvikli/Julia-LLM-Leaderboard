Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Match Julia code blocks between triple backticks\n    matches = eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s, md)\n    # Extract the code and join it with newlines\n    return join([match.captures[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `eachmatch` function from the `Regex` module to find all matches of Julia code blocks in the markdown document. The regular expression `\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s` matches triple backticks followed by the word \"julia\", a newline, any number of characters (non-greedily), and finally another newline and triple backticks. The captured group `(.*?)` contains the actual Julia code.\n\nThe function then extracts the first capture from each match using the `captures` property, and joins them together with newlines using the `join` function. The resulting string contains all the Julia code blocks in the markdown document, with the code fences removed and the blocks separated by newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[126,272],"elapsed":5.996778625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
