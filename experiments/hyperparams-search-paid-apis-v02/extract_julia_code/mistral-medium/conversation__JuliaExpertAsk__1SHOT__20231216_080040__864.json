Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution using regular expressions to extract the Julia code blocks from the markdown document:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    # Match triple-backticked Julia code blocks\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"is\n    matches = eachmatch(pattern, md)\n    \n    # Extract the code and join it with newlines\n    code = join([match.captures[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return code\nend\n```\nThe function `extract_julia_code` takes a markdown document `md` as a string argument and returns a string containing all the Julia code blocks with the triple-backticks removed. The regular expression pattern `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"is` matches one or more lines of text that are enclosed between triple-backticks and have the word \"julia\" immediately after the opening backticks. The `.*?` pattern matches any character (except a newline) zero or more times, and the `s` flag at the end of the pattern enables dotall mode, which allows the dot to match newlines as well. The `eachmatch` function returns an iterator over all the matches of the pattern in the markdown document, and the `captures` property of each match object contains the captured code block as a string. Finally, the `join` function concatenates all the code blocks with a newline character in between.","status":200,"tokens":[126,343],"elapsed":10.0982255,"_type":"aimessage"}]
