Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    # Match Julia code blocks between triple backticks\n    code_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s, md)\n    \n    # Remove leading/trailing whitespace and join code blocks with newline\n    return join(map(s -> strip(s), code_blocks), \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `Regex` module to match Julia code blocks between triple backticks (````julia`) using the regular expression `\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s`. The `matchall` function returns a vector of all matches, which are then processed using the `map` function to remove leading/trailing whitespace using the `strip` function. Finally, the code blocks are joined together with a newline using the `join` function.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input markdown document `md` is a string. If the input is a file, you can read its contents using the `read` function from the `Filesystem` module:\n```julia\nmd = read(file, String)\n```\nwhere `file` is a `File` object representing the markdown file.","status":200,"tokens":[126,308],"elapsed":22.4170975,"_type":"aimessage"}]
