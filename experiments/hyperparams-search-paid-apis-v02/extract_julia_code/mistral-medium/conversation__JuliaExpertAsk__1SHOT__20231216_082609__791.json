Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    # Find all code blocks that start with ```julia and end with ```\n    code_blocks = eachmatch(r\"```julia([\\s\\S]*?)```\"im, md)\n    \n    # Extract the Julia code from each code block and join them together with a newline\n    return join([match.captures[1] for match in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `eachmatch` function from the `Regex` module to find all occurrences of the regular expression ```julia([\\s\\S]*?)``` in the markdown document. This regular expression matches one or more code fences (`````) followed by the word `julia`, and then captures one or more characters (including newlines) until the next set of code fences. The `im` flag is used to make the regular expression case-insensitive and allow it to match newlines.\n\nFor each match, the function extracts the captured code block (i.e., the text between the code fences) using the `captures` property of the match object. It then joins all the extracted code blocks together with a newline using the `join` function. The resulting string is returned as the output of the function.","status":200,"tokens":[126,326],"elapsed":7.195414458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
