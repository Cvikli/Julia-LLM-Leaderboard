Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution for the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    code_block_regex = r\"```\\s*julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"is\n    matches = eachmatch(code_block_regex, md)\n    code_blocks = [match.captures[1] for match in matches]\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `Regex` module to define a regular expression that matches Julia code blocks in Markdown. The regular expression ````\\s*julia\\n(.*?)\\n```` matches the opening code fence with the word \"julia\", followed by any number of characters until the closing code fence, excluding the fences themselves. The `eachmatch` function is used to iterate over all matches in the input Markdown string, and the code blocks are extracted from the captures using `[match.captures[1] for match in matches]`. Finally, the code blocks are joined together with a newline character to form a single string.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the Markdown document is a valid string representation of a Markdown document, and that Julia code blocks are properly formatted with triple backticks and the word \"julia\" at the beginning of the opening fence. Additionally, this solution does not handle cases where the code is split across multiple code blocks, or where there are code blocks for languages other than Julia. In practice, you may need to modify this solution to handle more complex scenarios.","status":200,"tokens":[126,359],"elapsed":7.932279333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
