Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Match triple-backticked Julia code blocks\n    matches = eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"sm, md)\n    # Extract the code and join with newlines\n    return join([match.captures[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Regex` module to match triple-backticked Julia code blocks in the markdown document. The regular expression `\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"sm` matches a code block that starts with ```julia followed by a newline, contains any number of characters (non-greedily) up until the next ``` (followed by a newline), and ends with ``` (followed by a newline). The `s` and `m` flags are used to make the dot match newlines and to enable multiline mode, respectively.\n\nThe `eachmatch` function returns an iterator over all matches in the string. For each match, the `captures` property contains a vector of captured groups, where the first element is the entire match and the second element is the first (and only) capture group, which corresponds to the code block contents.\n\nFinally, the `join` function is used to concatenate all the code blocks together with a newline as the separator, resulting in a single string containing all the Julia code in the markdown document.","status":200,"tokens":[126,338],"elapsed":10.42599975,"_type":"aimessage"}]
