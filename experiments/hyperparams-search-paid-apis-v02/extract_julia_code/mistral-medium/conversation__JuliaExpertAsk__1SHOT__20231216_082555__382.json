Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    # Match Julia code blocks between triple backticks\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"is\n    matches = eachmatch(pattern, md)\n\n    # Extract the code and join it with newlines\n    code = join([match.captures[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\n\n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `Regex` module to define a regular expression pattern that matches Julia code blocks between triple backticks (````julia\\n...\\n````). It then uses the `eachmatch` function to iterate over all matches in the input markdown document `md`. For each match, it extracts the captured code block (i.e., the first capture group `match.captures[1]`) and concatenates it with the previous code blocks using the `join` function. Finally, it returns the resulting string of concatenated code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[126,251],"elapsed":5.675552959,"_type":"aimessage"}]
