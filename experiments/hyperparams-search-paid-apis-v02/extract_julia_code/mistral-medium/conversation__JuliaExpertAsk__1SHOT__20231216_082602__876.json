Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution for the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Find all Julia code blocks using a regular expression\n    code_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s, md)\n\n    # Extract the code from each block and join them together with a newline\n    return join([replace(code, r\"\\n\" => \"\\n\") for code in code_blocks], \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `Regex` module to find all Julia code blocks in the markdown document. The regular expression `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s` matches any sequence that starts with ```julia, followed by a newline, then any number of characters (non-greedily), and finally another newline and the closing ````. The `matchall` function returns an array of all matches.\n\nThe code inside each block is extracted using a comprehension, which iterates over each match and replaces any escaped newlines (`\\n`) with actual newlines (`\\n`). The resulting code strings are then joined together with a double newline separator (`\\n\\n`).\n\nNote that this function assumes that the input `md` is a string containing markdown text. If `md` is a file or some other type of object, you may need to convert it to a string first before calling this function.","status":200,"tokens":[126,335],"elapsed":7.425138042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
