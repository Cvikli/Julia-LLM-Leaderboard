Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution for the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    # match Julia code blocks between triple backticks\n    matches = matchall(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s, md)\n    # join the code blocks together with a newline\n    return join(map(s -> rstrip(s), matches), \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `Regex` module to match Julia code blocks in the markdown document. The regular expression `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s` matches any text between triple backticks (`````) that starts with the word \"julia\". The `(.*?)` captures the code block itself, and the `s` modifier allows the `.` character to match newlines as well.\n\nThe `matchall` function returns a vector of matches, where each match is a tuple containing the entire code block. The `map` function is used to remove any trailing whitespace from each code block using the `rstrip` function. Finally, the `join` function is used to concatenate all the code blocks together with a newline separator (`\"\\n\\n\"`).","status":200,"tokens":[126,290],"elapsed":6.448621208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
