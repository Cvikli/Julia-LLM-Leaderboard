Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

Imports the DataFrames library.\n2. Defines the `audi_filter` function that takes a DataFrame `df_cars` as an argument.\n3. Filters the DataFrame using the `@where` macro to select rows with manufacturer \"audi\" and model \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\".\n4. Transforms the filtered DataFrame using the `@transform` macro to create a new column `audi_a4_type` with the value `true` for all rows.\n5.
