The result is then converted to an integer type and added as a new column `ym`.\n\nNote that if the `dt` column is already in the `Date` or `DateTime` type, the `Dates.year` and `Dates.month` functions will work without explicitly converting the column type. If the column is in a different format, you may need to convert it to `Date` or `DateTime` before using this function.","status":200,"tokens":[120,239],"elapsed":5.253984333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
