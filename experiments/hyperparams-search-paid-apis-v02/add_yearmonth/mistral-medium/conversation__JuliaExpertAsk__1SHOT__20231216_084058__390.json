The `pad` and `lpad` parameters ensure that the year is formatted with four digits and that the month is formatted with two digits, with a leading zero if necessary. The resulting DataFrame is then returned with the new `ym` column.","status":200,"tokens":[120,187],"elapsed":4.196609792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
