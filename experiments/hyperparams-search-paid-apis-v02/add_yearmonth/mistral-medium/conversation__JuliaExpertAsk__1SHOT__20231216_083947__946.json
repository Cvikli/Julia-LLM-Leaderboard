Then, it concatenates them together in the format \"yyyymm\" using `string`, `lpad` (to pad single-digit months with a leading zero), and the multiplication operator (`*`). The multiplication by 100 ensures that the result is an integer.\n\nConfidence: 99%","status":200,"tokens":[120,182],"elapsed":4.066314042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
