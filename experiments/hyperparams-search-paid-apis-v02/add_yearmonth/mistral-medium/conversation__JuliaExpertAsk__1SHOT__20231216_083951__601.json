Then, it concatenates them together in the format \"yyyymm\" by converting the year to a string, left-padding the month with a leading zero using `lpad`, and finally multiplying the whole string by 100 to convert it to an integer. The resulting `ym` column is then added to the original DataFrame `df`.","status":200,"tokens":[120,187],"elapsed":4.096871083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
