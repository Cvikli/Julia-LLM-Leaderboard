This is a common idiom in Julia for defining short, simple functions inline.\n\nAlso note that the function assumes that the input `DataFrame` is called `df_cars`, as specified in the question. If the input `DataFrame` has a different name, you'll need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[98,221],"elapsed":4.887198583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
