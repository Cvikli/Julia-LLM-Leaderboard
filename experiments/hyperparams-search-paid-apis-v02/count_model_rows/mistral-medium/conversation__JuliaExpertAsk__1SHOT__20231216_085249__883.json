It then uses the `combine` function to calculate the number of rows for each group using the `nrow` function and renames the resulting column to `count`. The result is a new `DataFrame` that contains the count of rows for each car model.","status":200,"tokens":[98,147],"elapsed":3.250397458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
