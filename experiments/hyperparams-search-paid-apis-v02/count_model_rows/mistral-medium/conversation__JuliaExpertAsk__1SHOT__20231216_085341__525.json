The result is a new DataFrame with two columns: `model` and `count`.\n\nNote that the `nrow` function is used as a shorthand for counting the number of rows in each group. Alternatively, you could use the `length` function to achieve the same result:\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    return combine(groupby(df_cars, :model), x -> length(x[:model]) => :count)\nend\n```\nIn this version of the function, an anonymous function is used to calculate the length of the `model` column for each group, which is then assigned to the `:count` column in the resulting DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[98,266],"elapsed":5.814938417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
