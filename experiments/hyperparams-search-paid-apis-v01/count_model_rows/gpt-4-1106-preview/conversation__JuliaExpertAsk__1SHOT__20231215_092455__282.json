Below is the function `count_model_rows` written in Julia, which groups the DataFrame `df_cars` by the `model` column and calculates the count of rows for each model.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    return combine(groupby(df_cars, :model), nrow => :count)\nend\n```\n\nThis function will return a new DataFrame with each unique `model` and the corresponding count of rows for that model. The `groupby` function is used to create a `GroupedDataFrame` based on the `model` column, and the `combine` function is then used with `nrow` to calculate the count of rows for each group. The result is named `count` in the resulting DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[89,163],"elapsed":24.710291542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
