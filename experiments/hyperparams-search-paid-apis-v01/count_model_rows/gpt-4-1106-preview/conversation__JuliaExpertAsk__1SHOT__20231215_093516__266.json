Here is a function `count_model_rows` that takes a DataFrame `df_cars` with a column `model` and returns a DataFrame containing the counts for each model.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    # Group the dataframe by the 'model' column\n    grouped = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n    # Count the number of rows for each group\n    model_counts = combine(grouped, nrow => :count)\n    return model_counts\nend\n```\n\nTo use this function, you would pass it a DataFrame `df_cars` that has a `model` column. The function will return a new DataFrame with two columns, `model` and `count`, where `count` represents the number of occurrences of each `model`.","status":200,"tokens":[89,169],"elapsed":20.608919041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
