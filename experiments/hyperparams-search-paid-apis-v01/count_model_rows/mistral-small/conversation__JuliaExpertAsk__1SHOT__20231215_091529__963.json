The `countmap` function returns a dictionary with the unique elements of the input iterable as keys and the number of occurrences as values, which is exactly what you need.\n\nKeep in mind that if you need to return the result as a DataFrame, you can modify the function as follows:\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    counts = countmap(df_cars.model)\n    return DataFrame(model=collect(keys(counts)), count=values(counts))\nend\n```\n\nThis version of the function creates a new DataFrame with two columns: `model` and `count`, containing the unique car models and their corresponding row counts.","status":200,"tokens":[99,277],"elapsed":3.768977792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
