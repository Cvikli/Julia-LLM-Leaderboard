Here's how you can write the `count_model_rows` function in Julia:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    return combine(groupby(df_cars, :model), nrow => :count)\nend\n```\nIn the code above, `groupby(df_cars, :model)` groups the `df_cars` DataFrame by the `model` column. The `combine` function then calculates the number of rows in each group using the `nrow` function and renames the resulting column to `count`. The function returns a new DataFrame containing the count of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[98,175],"elapsed":11.214750458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
