Import the DataFrames package\n2. Define the function `count_model_rows` with the input argument `df_cars::DataFrame`\n3. Inside the function, use `groupby(df_cars, :model)` to group data by the `model` column\n4. Utilize `combine` with `nrow => :count` to count the number of rows for each group\n5.
