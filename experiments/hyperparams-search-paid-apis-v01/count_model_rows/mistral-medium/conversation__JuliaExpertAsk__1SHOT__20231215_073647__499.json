Then, `combine` is used to calculate the number of rows (using `nrow`) for each group and assign the result to a new column named `:count`. The result is a DataFrame containing the unique car models and their corresponding row counts.","status":200,"tokens":[98,128],"elapsed":2.997797667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
