The result is a new DataFrame with two columns: `model` and the counted number of rows, which I'll call `n`.\n\nConfidence: 100%. This solution uses idiomatic Julia code and follows best practices for working with DataFrames in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[98,165],"elapsed":3.696158625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
