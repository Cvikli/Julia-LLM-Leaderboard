The result is a new DataFrame with two columns: `model` and `count`, where `count` indicates the number of rows for each `model`.\n\nNote that the `nrow => :count` syntax is a short form of writing a function that takes a group and returns its size. The `=>` operator is used to define the function, and `:count` is a symbol that represents the size of the group. This syntax is available in Julia 1.6 and later versions. If you are using an older version of Julia, you can write the function explicitly as follows:\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    return combine(groupby(df_cars, :model), g -> nrow(g), :model => :count)\nend\n```\n\nIn this version, the function `g -> nrow(g)` is passed as the first argument to `combine`, and the `:` symbol is used to define the names of the output columns. The `:count` symbol indicates that the output column should be named `count`.","status":200,"tokens":[98,334],"elapsed":9.298485,"_type":"aimessage"}]
