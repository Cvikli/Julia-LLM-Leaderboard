Finally, it returns the aggregated result.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\njulia> df_cars = DataFrame(model = [\"Toyota\", \"BMW\", \"Toyota\", \"BMW\", \"Mercedes\"], year = [2015, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021])\n\njulia> count_model_rows(df_cars)\n3×2 DataFrame\n Row │ model      count\n     │ String     Int64\n─────┼──────────────────\n   1 │ BMW             2\n   2 │ Mercedes        1\n   3 │ Toyota           2\n```\n\nConfidence: 95%\nThe code uses well-established Julia packages and follows the official documentation, so it should work as intended. I recommend verifying the input data structure and packages' availability before using the function.","status":200,"tokens":[98,352],"elapsed":7.887910292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
