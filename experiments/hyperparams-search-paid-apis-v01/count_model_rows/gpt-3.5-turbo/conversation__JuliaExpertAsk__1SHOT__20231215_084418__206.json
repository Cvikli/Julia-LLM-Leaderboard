Here's the implementation of the `count_model_rows` function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    return by(df_cars, :model, size)\nend\n```\n\nThe `by` function takes the DataFrame `df_cars` and the column `:model` as arguments to group the data by model. Then, the `size` function is applied to each group to count the number of rows. The result is a new DataFrame with two columns: `model` and `x1`, where `x1` contains the number of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[89,169],"elapsed":4.451359916,"_type":"aimessage"}]
