Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

It then selects the rows that match the mask and creates a new column `audi_a4_type` with `true` values across all rows. Finally, it returns the resulting DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[149,191],"elapsed":4.275041791,"_type":"aimessage"}]
