Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the Julia code to achieve this:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    filtered_df = df_cars[df_cars[:manufacturer] .== \"audi\" & (df_cars[:model] .== \"a4\" | df_cars[:model] .== \"a4 quattro\"), :]\n    filtered_df[:audi_a4_type] = true\n    return filtered_df\nend\n```\n\nYou can call this function with your `df_cars` DataFrame to get the filtered results. This code uses the Julia DataFrames library to filter the DataFrame based on the provided conditions and adds a new column `audi_a4_type` with `true` values across all filtered rows.","status":200,"tokens":[149,182],"elapsed":11.877943875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
