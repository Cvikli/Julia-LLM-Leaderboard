Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of the `audi_filter` function:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    filtered_df = df_cars[df_cars[:manufacturer] .== \"audi\" & (df_cars[:model] .== \"a4\" | df_cars[:model] .== \"a4 quattro\"), :]\n    filtered_df[:audi_a4_type] = true\n    return filtered_df\nend\n```\nThis function first filters the input DataFrame `df_cars` to only include rows where the `manufacturer` column is equal to `\"audi\"` and the `model` column is either `\"a4\"` or `\"a4 quattro\"`. It then adds a new column `audi_a4_type` to the filtered DataFrame and sets its value to `true` for all rows. Finally, the function returns the resulting DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[149,214],"elapsed":7.257151083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
