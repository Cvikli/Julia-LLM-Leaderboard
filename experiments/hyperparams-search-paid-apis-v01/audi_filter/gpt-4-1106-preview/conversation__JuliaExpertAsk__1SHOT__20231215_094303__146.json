Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Below is a Julia function that performs the desired filtering and column addition:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    # Filter down to rows with the manufacturer \"audi\" and model \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\"\n    audi_a4_df = filter(row -> row.manufacturer == \"audi\" && (row.model == \"a4\" || row.model == \"a4 quattro\"), df_cars)\n    \n    # Add a new column `audi_a4_type` with the value `true`\n    audi_a4_df.audi_a4_type = true\n    \n    return audi_a4_df\nend\n```\n\nTo use the `audi_filter` function, make sure that you have the `DataFrames` package installed and loaded in your environment. Then, simply apply the `audi_filter` function to your `df_cars` DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[137,186],"elapsed":20.654702792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
