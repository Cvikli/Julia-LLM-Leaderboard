Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Answer\n\nYou can use the following code to achieve this:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df::DataFrame)\n    filter_func = row -> row[:manufacturer] == \"audi\" && \n                        (row[:model] == \"a4\" || row[:model] == \"a4 quattro\")\n    df_filtered = filter(filter_func, df)\n    df_filtered[:audi_a4_type] = true\n    return df_filtered\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes in a DataFrame `df` as input, filters the rows based on the conditions specified, and adds a new column `audi_a4_type` with a value of `true`. It then returns the resulting DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[137,144],"elapsed":3.750537708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
