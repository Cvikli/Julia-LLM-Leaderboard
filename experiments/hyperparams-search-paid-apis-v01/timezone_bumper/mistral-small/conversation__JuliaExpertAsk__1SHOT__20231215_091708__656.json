The function takes two arguments: `dt`, which should be a `DateTime` object, and `bump`, which is an optional argument with a default value of 3. If `bump` is not provided, it will default to 3.\n\nThe function first checks if `dt` is a `DateTime` object. If it is not, the function throws an `ArgumentError` with a message indicating that `dt` must be of type `DateTime`. If `dt` is a `DateTime` object, the function returns the result of adding `bump` hours to `dt` using the `Dates.Hour` function.","status":200,"tokens":[112,237],"elapsed":3.276142708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
