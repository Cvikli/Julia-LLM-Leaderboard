If it is not and instead it's a `Date` type, it throws an `ArgumentError`. If the input is a `DateTime`, it adds `bump` hours to the timestamp using `Dates.Hour(bump)` and returns the new `DateTime`. The default value of `bump` is set to 3 hours.","status":200,"tokens":[111,179],"elapsed":7.10955225,"_type":"aimessage"}]
