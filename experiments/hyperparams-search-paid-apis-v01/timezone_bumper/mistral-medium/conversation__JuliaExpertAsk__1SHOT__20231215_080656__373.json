Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the function you requested:\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    if typeof(dt) <: DateTime\n        return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\n    else\n        throw(DomainError(dt, \"timezone_bumper function only works for DateTime types\"))\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function checks if the input is of type `DateTime` using the `<:` operator. If the input is a `DateTime`, then it adds `bump` hours to the timestamp using the `+` operator and `Dates.Hour(bump)` to create a `Dates.Period` object representing `bump` hours. If the input is not a `DateTime`, it throws a `DomainError` with a custom error message.\n\nNote that the `DateTime` type in Julia is a composite type that includes both a date and a time, while the `Date` type only includes a date. Therefore, it is appropriate to throw an error if the input is a `Date` type, as adding hours to a date without a time does not make sense.","status":200,"tokens":[111,248],"elapsed":5.530585083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
