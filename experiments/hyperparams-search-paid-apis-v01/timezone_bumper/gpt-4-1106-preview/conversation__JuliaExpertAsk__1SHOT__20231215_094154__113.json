The first method accepts a `DateTime` and an integer `bump`, with a default value of 3. It adds the specified number of hours to the `DateTime`.\n\n2. The second method is triggered when a `Date` type is passed. It throws an `ArgumentError` indicating the wrong type is being used. The intention is that this method doesn't provide a default for `bump` to ensure that if the `timezone_bumper` is called with a single `Date` argument the error will be triggered.","status":200,"tokens":[102,193],"elapsed":17.95852525,"_type":"aimessage"}]
