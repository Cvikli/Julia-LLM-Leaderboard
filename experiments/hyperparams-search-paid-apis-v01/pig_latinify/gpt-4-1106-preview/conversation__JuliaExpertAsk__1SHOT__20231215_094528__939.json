Here's a concise function definition achieving this task:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    transform_to_pig_latin(word::String) = begin\n        if length(word) > 0 && isletter(word[1])\n            vowel_idx = findfirst(c -> c in \"aeiouAEIOU\", word)\n            if vowel_idx === nothing\n                return word * \"ay\"  # Treat words without a vowel as a special case\n            elseif vowel_idx == 1\n                return word * \"way\"  # Rule for words starting with a vowel\n            else\n                consonant_cluster = word[1:vowel_idx-1]\n                rest_of_word = word[vowel_idx:end]\n                return rest_of_word * consonant_cluster * \"ay\"  # Rule for words starting with consonants\n            end\n        else\n            return word  # In case of an empty string or non-letter character\n        end\n    end\n\n    tasks = [Threads.@spawn transform_to_pig_latin(word) for word in words]\n    return [fetch(task) for task in tasks]\nend\n``` \n\nThis `pig_latinify` function defines an inner function `transform_to_pig_latin` that applies the pig latin rules to a single word. It then uses a comprehension with `Threads.@spawn` to create tasks for each word in the input `words` vector. Finally, it collects the results using `fetch` on each task.\n\nTo use the function, make sure you have a Julia environment with multithreading enabled. You can set the number of threads by starting Julia with the `-t` or `--threads` command-line option, or by setting the `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` environment variable.\n\nPlease note that in real-world scenarios, spawning a thread for each word might be inefficient if the vector contains many short words due to the overhead of context-switching. For a large number of small tasks, a thread pool or batching strategy can often lead to better performance.","status":200,"tokens":[97,463],"elapsed":36.888775666,"_type":"aimessage"}]
