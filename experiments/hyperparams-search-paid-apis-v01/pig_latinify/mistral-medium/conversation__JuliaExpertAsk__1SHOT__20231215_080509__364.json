Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of the `pig_latinify` function in Julia:\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    pig_latin_strings = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    @sync begin\n        for (i, word) in enumerate(words)\n            @async begin\n                if startswith(lowercase(word), [\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"])\n                    pig_latin_strings[i] = word * \"way\"\n                else\n                    first_consonants = match(r\"^[^aeiou]+\", lowercase(word)).match\n                    pig_latin_strings[i] = word[length(first_consonants) + 1:end] * first_consonants * \"ay\"\n                end\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return pig_latin_strings\nend\n```\nThis implementation uses the `Distributed` standard library to create separate threads for each iteration of the loop. The `@async` macro creates a new task for each string in the input vector, and the `@sync` macro ensures that all tasks are completed before returning the result.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input vector contains only strings. If the input may contain other types, you may need to add error handling to ensure that only strings are processed.","status":200,"tokens":[107,324],"elapsed":7.182171083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
