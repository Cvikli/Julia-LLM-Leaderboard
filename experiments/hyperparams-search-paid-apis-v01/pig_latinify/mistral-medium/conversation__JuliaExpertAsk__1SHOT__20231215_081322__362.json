It creates a vector of strings in pig latin from the input vector of strings.\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latin_transform(str)\n    if isempty(str) || str[1] âˆˆ ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n        return string(str, \"way\")\n    else\n        first_consonants = split(str, \"[aeiou]\", limit=2)[1]\n        return string(str[length(first_consonsants)+1:end], first_consonants, \"ay\")\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(input_vector)\n    threads = Threads.@spawn for str in input_vector\n        pig_latin_transform(str)\n    end\n    return [fetch(t) for t in threads]\nend\n```\n\nThis code first defines a helper function `pig_latin_transform` to convert an individual string to pig latin. Then, the main function `pig_latinify` spawns multiple threads to process each string in the input vector using the helper function. The results are fetched and collected into a single output vector.","status":200,"tokens":[107,295],"elapsed":16.729766125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
