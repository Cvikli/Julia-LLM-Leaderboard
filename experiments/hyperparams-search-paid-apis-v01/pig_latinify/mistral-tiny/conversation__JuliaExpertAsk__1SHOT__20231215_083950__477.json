It also includes a `pig_latin_transformer` function that takes a vector of strings, creates separate threads for each string, and processes the results in a thread-safe way.\n\nKeep in mind that this solution uses Julia's `@spawnat` macro for multithreading, which is a more low-level and less recommended approach compared to the newer `ThreadPools` package. For larger projects, consider using `ThreadPools` for better thread management and easier integration.","status":200,"tokens":[107,530],"elapsed":4.500277292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
