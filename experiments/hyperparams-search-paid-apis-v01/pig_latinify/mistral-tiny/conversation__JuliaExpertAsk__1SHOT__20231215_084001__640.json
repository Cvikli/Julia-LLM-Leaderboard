It checks whether the first letter of the string is a vowel or a consonant and returns the pig latin version accordingly.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_threaded` function takes a vector of strings as an argument and applies the `pig_latinify` function to each string concurrently using threads. It spawns one thread for each string and waits for all threads to finish, then returns the results as a vector.\n\nNote that the code above assumes that you have already installed the `Threads` module. To install the `Threads` module, run `using Pkg; Pkg.add(\"Threads\")` in your Julia REPL.","status":200,"tokens":[107,495],"elapsed":4.445376791,"_type":"aimessage"}]
