If the string is empty, it simply copies it to the result vector. If the first character is a letter, it appends \"ay\" to the end of the rest of the string with the first character moved to the front. If the first character is not a letter, it appends \"way\" to the end of the rest of the string with the first character moved to the front.","status":200,"tokens":[107,319],"elapsed":5.134771958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
