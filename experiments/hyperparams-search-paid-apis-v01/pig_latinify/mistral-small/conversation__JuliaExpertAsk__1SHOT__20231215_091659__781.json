The `Threads.@threads` macro allows us to iterate over the input vector in parallel, with each thread handling a separate index.\n\nThe function handles both lower- and uppercase letters for the first letter of the word. If the first letter is a letter, it moves it to the end and appends \"ay\". If the first character is not a letter (e.g., a space, punctuation, or number), it appends \"way\" to the end of the word.\n\nFor simplicity, this implementation assumes that the input vector is not modified during the execution of `pig_latinify`. If the input vector is modified concurrently, the behavior is undefined. If you need to handle concurrent modifications, consider creating a copy of the input vector before processing it.","status":200,"tokens":[107,406],"elapsed":5.398312875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
