It then iterates over the input vector in parallel, applying the pig latin transformation to each string and storing the result in the corresponding position in the `result` vector. The `isvowel` variable checks if the first character of the string is a vowel or a consonant. If it's a vowel, the string is appended with \"way\"; otherwise, the first character is moved to the end, followed by \"ay\".","status":200,"tokens":[107,292],"elapsed":3.9198575,"_type":"aimessage"}]
