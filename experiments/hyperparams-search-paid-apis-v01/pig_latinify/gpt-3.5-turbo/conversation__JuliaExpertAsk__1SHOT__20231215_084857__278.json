Each iteration calls the `pig_latinify_word` function to transform the string into pig latin. Finally, the results are collected and returned as a vector of strings.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_word` function checks if the word starts with a vowel. If so, it appends \"ay\" to the end. Otherwise, it finds the first vowel in the word and reorders the letters accordingly before appending \"ay\" to the end.\n\nNote that threading in Julia is not always advantageous or efficient, and it depends on the specific workload and hardware setup. It's recommended to benchmark and test different approaches to determine the best solution for your specific use case.","status":200,"tokens":[97,324],"elapsed":8.127353917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
