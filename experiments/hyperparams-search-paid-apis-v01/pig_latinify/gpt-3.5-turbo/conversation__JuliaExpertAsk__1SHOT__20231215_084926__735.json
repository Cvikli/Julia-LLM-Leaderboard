The function utilizes Julia's `@threadcall` macro to create a separate thread for processing each word concurrently. \n\nThe `pig_latinify_word` function transforms a single word to pig latin by moving the first consonant cluster (if any) to the end of the word and adding \"ay\" to the end. If the word starts with a vowel or is empty, it is left unchanged.\n\nPlease note that the `pig_latinify` function returns a new vector of strings with pig latin transformation, instead of modifying the original input vector.","status":200,"tokens":[97,327],"elapsed":8.479729792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
