It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    transformed_words = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    \n    @threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        transformed_words[i] = pig_latinify_word(words[i])\n    end\n    \n    transformed_words\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_word(word::String)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    \n    if isempty(word) || any(v -> v == word[1], vowels)\n        return word\n    else\n        return word[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as input and creates a new vector to store the transformed words. It then uses the `@threads` macro from the `Base.Threads` module to parallelize the loop over the input words. Each thread calls the `pig_latinify_word` function to transform a word and stores the result in the corresponding position in the `transformed_words` vector. Finally, it returns the vector of transformed words.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_word` function takes a single word as input and determines whether it needs to be transformed or not. If the word is empty or starts with a vowel, it is returned as is. Otherwise, it moves the first letter to the end of the word and appends \"ay\".","status":200,"tokens":[97,302],"elapsed":7.307727292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
