Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Answer\n\nTo create a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from the `dt` column in the DataFrame `df` and concatenating them together as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\", you can use the following code:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df.ym = Dates.format.(df.dt, \"yyyymm\") |> parse.(Int)\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis code uses the `Dates.format` function from the `Dates` module to format the `dt` column as \"yyyymm\". The `.|>` operator is used to broadcast the formatting operation to each element in the `df.dt` column. Then, the `parse.(Int)` function is used to convert the resulting strings to integers. Finally, the `ym` column is assigned to the modified values of `df.dt`. The function returns the updated DataFrame `df` with the new column `ym` added.\n\nYou can call this function by passing your DataFrame `df` as an argument. For example:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt = DateTime.([\"2022-01-15\", \"2022-02-20\", \"2022-03-25\"]))\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will add a new column `ym` to the DataFrame `df` with the year and month values extracted from the `dt` column.","status":200,"tokens":[110,289],"elapsed":6.897730083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
