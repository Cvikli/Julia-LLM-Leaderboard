It creates a copy of the DataFrame to prevent modifying the original one. The `map` function is used to apply the `year` and `month` functions to each datetime value in the `dt` column, converting them to strings and concatenating them using the `*` operator. The resulting strings are then converted back to integers using the `map` function and the `parse` function from the `Int64` module. The `10` is added to the strings representing months in order to correctly concatenate them with years.","status":200,"tokens":[122,224],"elapsed":1.96372375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
