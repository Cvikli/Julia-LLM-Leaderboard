The resulting vector is then transformed into an integer vector by chaining several pipeline operations (`.|>`) including converting strings to integers using `parse(Int64, string())`. The month digits are hard-coded in the form of a vector `string.(1:12)`, which gets concatenated with the year vector using the `.*` operator. Finally, the resulting vector is cast back to an Array{Int64} to match the DataFrame column data type.","status":200,"tokens":[122,235],"elapsed":2.024261125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
