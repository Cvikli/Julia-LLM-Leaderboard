Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that does what you're looking for:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df.ym = DateTime.(df.dt).year * 100 + DateTime.(df.dt).month\n    return df\nend\n```\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df` as input and adds a new column `ym` to it. The `DateTime.(df.dt)` expression converts the `dt` column from whatever type it currently is (assumed to be a Date-like type) to an array of `DateTime` objects. We then extract the year and month from each `DateTime` object using the `year` and `month` functions, respectively, and concatenate them together as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\". The resulting array is then assigned to the `ym` column of the `df` DataFrame. Finally, the modified DataFrame is returned by the function.\n\nNote: This function assumes that the `dt` column of the input DataFrame contains valid date-time data. If this is not the case, the function may produce unexpected results or errors.","status":200,"tokens":[122,255],"elapsed":3.515961375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
