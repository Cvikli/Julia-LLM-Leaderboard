Here's a brief and concise solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates, DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(x -> string(Dates.YearMonth(x).year * 100 + Dates.Month(x)), df[:dt])\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function defines a new column `ym` in the DataFrame `df` by extracting the year and month from the `dt` column and concatenating them as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\". The `Dates.YearMonth()` function is used to extract the year and month from the datetime, and then they are concatenated as a string and converted to an integer.\n\nNote that the `Dates` and `DataFrames` packages need to be imported at the beginning of the script using `using Dates, DataFrames`.","status":200,"tokens":[120,228],"elapsed":9.373692583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
