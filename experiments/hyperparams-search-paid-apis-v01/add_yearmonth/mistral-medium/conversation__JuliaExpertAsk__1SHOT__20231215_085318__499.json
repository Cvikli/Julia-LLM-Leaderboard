The `year` and `month` functions are used to extract the year and month respectively, and the `string` function is used to convert the results to strings. The `pad` argument is used to pad the month value with a leading zero if it is a single digit. The `*` operator is used to concatenate the year and month strings together. The function returns the updated DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[120,221],"elapsed":31.9060945,"_type":"aimessage"}]
