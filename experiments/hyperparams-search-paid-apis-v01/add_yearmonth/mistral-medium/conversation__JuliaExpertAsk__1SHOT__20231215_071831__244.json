The `transform` function from `DataFrames` is used to create a new column, `ym`, by applying the provided function to the `dt` column. The `ByRow` function ensures that the operation is performed on a row-wise basis.\n\nConfidence: 95%","status":200,"tokens":[120,190],"elapsed":6.038068042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
