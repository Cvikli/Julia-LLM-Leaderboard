The transformation is performed using an anonymous function (`ByRow()`) that takes each row's `dt` value, extracts the year and month using the `Dates.year()` and `Dates.month()` functions, respectively, and concatenates them as a string in the format `yyyymm`. The resulting string is then assigned to the `ym` column for that row.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the `dt` column contains `DateTime` values. If it contains values of a different type, the function may need to be modified accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[120,239],"elapsed":5.342083708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
