Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that should achieve what you are asking for:\n```\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = string.(Dates.year.(df[:dt]), Dates.month.(df[:dt]), pad=4) |> Int .>> string\n    return df\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n1. `Dates.year(df[:dt])` extracts the years from the `dt` column.\n2. `Dates.month(df[:dt])` extracts the months from the `dt` column.\n3. `string.(..., pad=4)` converts the years and months to strings, padding single-digit months with a leading zero to ensure a consistent length.\n4. `|> Int .>> string` converts the numeric year and month values to integers, concatenates them, and then converts the resulting integer back to a string. This is necessary because Julia's string concatenation operator (`*`) only works with strings, not integers.\n5. `df[:ym] = ...` assigns the resulting vector of year-month strings to a new column called `ym` in the DataFrame.\n6. Finally, `return df` returns the modified DataFrame.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the `dt` column is of type `DateTime`. If it is of a different type, you may need to convert it to `DateTime` first using the `Dates.DateTime()` function.","status":200,"tokens":[120,315],"elapsed":20.469262875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
