It splits the input text into words based on whitespace and punctuation using a regular expression. It then iterates through each word, appending it to the current line if the total length of the current line plus the length of the next word doesn't exceed the text width. If the text width is exceeded, the function starts a new line and appends the current word to it. Finally, the function returns the wrapped text as a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[103,341],"elapsed":7.157810375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
