It splits the text into words, then iterates through them, adding each word to the current line if it fits within the width limit. If the word exceeds the limit, it starts a new line and continues with the next word. Finally, it collects all the lines and joins them with newline characters to return the wrapped text.","status":200,"tokens":[103,262],"elapsed":2.266365834,"_type":"aimessage"}]
