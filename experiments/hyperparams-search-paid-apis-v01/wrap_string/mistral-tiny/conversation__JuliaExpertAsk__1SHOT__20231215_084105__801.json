The function splits the input string into words, then iterates through each word, checking if the current line length would exceed the maximum width. If so, it adds the current line to a list of lines and starts a new line with the current word. Once all words have been processed, the function returns a joined string of all the lines, with a newline character in between each line.","status":200,"tokens":[103,265],"elapsed":2.298409458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
