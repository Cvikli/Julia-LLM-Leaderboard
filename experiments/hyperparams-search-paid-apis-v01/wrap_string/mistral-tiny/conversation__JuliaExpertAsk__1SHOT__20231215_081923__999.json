It splits the input text into words and whitespaces, initializes an empty array for storing the output lines, and sets an empty string as the current line. It then iterates through each word and checks whether the length of the current line plus the length of the word and a single space will exceed the `text_width`. If it does, the current line is added to the output lines, and the next word becomes the new line. The function continues this process until all the words have been processed. The last line, if any, is also added to the output lines. Finally, the function returns a single string that is the concatenation of all the output lines with a newline character between them.","status":200,"tokens":[103,431],"elapsed":12.700719083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
