The function returns `true` if the provided vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving (Car or Motorcycle), and `false` otherwise (Bus or Truck). For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, the function defaults to `false`.\n\nWe provide an example usage of the function with different vehicle types to demonstrate its behavior.","status":200,"tokens":[134,218],"elapsed":5.832325041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
