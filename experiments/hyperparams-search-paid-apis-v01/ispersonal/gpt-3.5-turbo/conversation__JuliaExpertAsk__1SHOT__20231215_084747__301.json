The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The function `ispersonal` takes a type parameter `vehicle` and checks if it is equal to `Car` or `Motorcycle`, in which case it returns `true`. If the `vehicle` type is `Bus` or `Truck`, it returns `false`. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle` or non-subtype, the function also returns `false`. Finally, we test the function with different vehicle types to demonstrate its behavior.","status":200,"tokens":[134,259],"elapsed":7.262317625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
