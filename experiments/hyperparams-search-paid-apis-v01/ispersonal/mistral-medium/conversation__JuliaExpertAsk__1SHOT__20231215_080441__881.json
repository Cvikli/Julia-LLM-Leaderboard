The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The last definition of `ispersonal` with the signature `ispersonal(::Type{<:AbstractVehicle})` serves as the default behavior for any subtype of `AbstractVehicle` that is not explicitly handled by one of the previous definitions.","status":200,"tokens":[150,325],"elapsed":9.335154792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
