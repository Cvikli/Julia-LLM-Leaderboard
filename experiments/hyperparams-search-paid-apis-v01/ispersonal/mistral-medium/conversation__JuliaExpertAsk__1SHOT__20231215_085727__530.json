We then define the `ispersonal` function to return `false` by default for any subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, but to return `true` for the `Car` and `Motorcycle` types. Finally, we provide an example usage of the `ispersonal` function for each of the four vehicle types, and for the supertype `AbstractVehicle` and a union type `Union{Car, Motorcycle}`. Note that the `ispersonal` function does not have a method for the union type, so a `MethodError` is thrown if it is called with this type.","status":200,"tokens":[150,485],"elapsed":46.263045458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
