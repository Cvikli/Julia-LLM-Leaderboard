All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

This is done using the `∋` (isinet operator), which checks if an element is present in a collection. If it is, the function returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[146,202],"elapsed":1.812074875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
