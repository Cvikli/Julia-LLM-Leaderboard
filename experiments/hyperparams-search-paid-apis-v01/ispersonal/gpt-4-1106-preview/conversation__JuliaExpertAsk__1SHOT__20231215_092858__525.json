All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly!

For `Car` and `Motorcycle`, it returns `true`, and for `Bus`, `Truck`, and any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, it returns `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[134,264],"elapsed":25.3364215,"_type":"aimessage"}]
