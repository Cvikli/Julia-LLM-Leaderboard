All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly. Below is the definition of the `ispersonal` function, assuming that the types `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, `Truck`, and `AbstractVehicle` are already defined in the current environment:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Bus}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{Truck}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{<:AbstractVehicle}) = false\n\n# Example usage:\nis_personal_car = ispersonal(Car) # true\nis_personal_motorcycle = ispersonal(Motorcycle) # true\nis_personal_bus = ispersonal(Bus) # false\nis_personal_truck = ispersonal(Truck) # false\n```\n\nPlease note that the function uses Julia's dispatch mechanism to determine the return value based on the type of the vehicle. It specifies a method for each known personal vehicle type (`Car` and `Motorcycle`) and defaults to `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.","status":200,"tokens":[134,252],"elapsed":25.197971833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
