All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia function `ispersonal` that serves the specified purpose:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\n# Define the specific vehicle types\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\n# Define the ispersonal function\nispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Bus}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{Truck}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{<:AbstractVehicle}) = false\n\n# Example usage:\npersonal_car = ispersonal(Car) # This should return true\n```\n\nThis function uses multiple dispatch based on the type of the vehicle provided. When the type is `Car` or `Motorcycle`, it returns `true`, indicating that they are personal vehicles. For `Bus` and `Truck`, it returns `false`. The last method is a catch-all for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, defaulting to `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[134,216],"elapsed":22.559479083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
