It returns `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle`, `false` for `Bus` and `Truck`, and defaults to `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. The example shows how to use the function with each of the defined vehicle types.","status":200,"tokens":[134,290],"elapsed":32.683278375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
