All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the `ispersonal` function you requested:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Type{<:Car}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{<:Motorcycle}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{<:Bus}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{<:Truck}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{<:AbstractVehicle}) = false  # default case\n\n# Example usage\nispersonal(Car)        # true\nispersonal(Motorcycle) # true\nispersonal(Bus)        # false\nispersonal(Truck)      # false\nispersonal(AbstractVehicle) # false\n```\n\nPlease note that the function uses Julia's dispatch mechanism to pattern match on the type of vehicle being checked and responds accordingly. It's important to call `ispersonal` with the type itself, not an instance of the type, e.g., `ispersonal(Car)` instead of `ispersonal(Car())`.","status":200,"tokens":[134,230],"elapsed":21.777280792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
