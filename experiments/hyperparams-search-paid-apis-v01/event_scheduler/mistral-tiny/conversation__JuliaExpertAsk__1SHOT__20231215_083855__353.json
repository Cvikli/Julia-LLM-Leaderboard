The function first sorts the events by their start time and then checks for any conflicts by comparing the finish time of each event to the start time of the next event. If there is a conflict, the function returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, if all events have been checked and there are no conflicts, the function returns \"No conflicts\". If the input is an empty vector, the function returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[162,262],"elapsed":2.338557458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
