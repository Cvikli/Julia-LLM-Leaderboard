It first sorts the events based on their start times and then checks for any conflicts by comparing the end of the previous event with the start of the current event. If there is a conflict, it returns \"Conflict\". If all events have been processed and there are no conflicts, it returns \"No conflicts\". If the input list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[162,253],"elapsed":2.196535708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
