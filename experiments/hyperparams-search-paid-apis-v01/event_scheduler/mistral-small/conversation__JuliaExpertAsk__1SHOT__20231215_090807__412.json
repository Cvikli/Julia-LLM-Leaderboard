Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia function that meets your requirements:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    sorted_events = sort(events, by = x -> Dates.DateTime(x[1]))\n    unique_starts = unique(getfield.(sorted_events, 1))\n\n    for i in 1:length(unique_starts)-1\n        lower_bound = unique_starts[i]\n        upper_bound = unique_starts[i+1]\n\n        overlapping_events = filter(x -> lower_bound ≤ Dates.DateTime(x[2]) ≤ upper_bound, sorted_events)\n\n        if !isempty(overlapping_events)\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nYou can use this function to check scheduling conflicts in your list of events.
