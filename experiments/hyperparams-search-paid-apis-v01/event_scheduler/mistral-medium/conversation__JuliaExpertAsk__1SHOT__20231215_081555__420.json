Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a solution for your problem using Julia:\n\nFirst, make sure to add the `Dates` package. You can do this by running the following command in your Julia environment:\n\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"Dates\")\n```\n\nNow, you can create the `event_scheduler` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    events = [(DateTime(start), DateTime(finish)) for (start, finish) in events]\n    sorted_events = sort(events, by = x -> x[1])\n\n    for i in 1:length(sorted_events) - 1\n        if sorted_events[i+1][1] <= sorted_events[i][2]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of tuples with start and finish times in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'. It first checks if the list is empty, and if so, it returns \"No events\". Otherwise, it parses the dates and sorts the events by their start times. Then, it iterates through the sorted list to check for any scheduling conflicts. If there are no conflicts, it returns \"No conflicts\"; otherwise, it returns \"Conflict\".","status":200,"tokens":[161,325],"elapsed":17.372349792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
