Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    event_times = [DateTime(event[1], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\") : DateTime(event[2], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\") for event in events]\n    \n    for i in 1:length(event_times)-1\n        for j in i+1:length(event_times)\n            if intersection(event_times[i], event_times[j]) !== DateTime[]\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThe function `event_scheduler` checks for scheduling conflicts among the events by converting the start and finish times to `DateTime` objects, and then compares each event's time range for intersections. If any intersections are found, it returns \"Conflict\". If there are no events in the list, it returns \"No events\". Otherwise, if no conflicts are found, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[146,202],"elapsed":5.001848208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
