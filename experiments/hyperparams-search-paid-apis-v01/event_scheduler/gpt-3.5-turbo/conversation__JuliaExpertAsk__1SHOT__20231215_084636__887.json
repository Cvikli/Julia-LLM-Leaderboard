Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort(events, by = x -> x[1])\n    \n    for i in 1:length(sorted_events) - 1\n        if DateTime(sorted_events[i][2]) > DateTime(sorted_events[i+1][1])\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. We check if the list of events is empty and return \"No events\" if it is.\n2. We sort the events based on their start time.\n3. We iterate through the sorted events, comparing the finish time of each event with the start time of the next event. If we find any overlap, we immediately return \"Conflict\".\n4. If we finish iterating without finding any conflicts, we return \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[146,185],"elapsed":4.494731375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
