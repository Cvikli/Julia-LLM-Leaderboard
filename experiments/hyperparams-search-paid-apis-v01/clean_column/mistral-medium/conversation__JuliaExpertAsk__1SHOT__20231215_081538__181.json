The `replace` function then replaces all matching characters with an underscore (`_`). The `strip` function removes any leading or trailing whitespace, and `lowercase` converts the resulting string to lowercase.\n\nNote that the input argument `col` is of type `AbstractString` to allow for both `String` and `SubString` inputs. If you want to restrict the input to only strings, you can change the type to `String`.","status":200,"tokens":[116,177],"elapsed":9.537024708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
