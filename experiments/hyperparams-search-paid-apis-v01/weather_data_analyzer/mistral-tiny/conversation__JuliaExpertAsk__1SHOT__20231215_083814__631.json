Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::AbstractVector)\n    statistics = Statistics.mean(temps), Statistics.maximum(temps), Statistics.minimum(temps)\n    trend = length(temps) > 1 ?

Then it determines the trend by checking if the vector has more than one element and if the covariance between the temperature vector and the index vector is positive.
