Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that does what you're asking for:\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    if length(temps) < 2\n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:stable)\n    end\n\n    sorted_temps = sort(temps)\n    first_temp = first(temps)\n    last_temp = last(sorted_temps)\n\n    if last_temp > first_temp\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif last_temp < first_temp\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThe function first checks if the input list `temps` is empty. If it is, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, the function calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package. If the length of the input list is less than 2, the function returns a named tuple with the calculated statistics and `:stable` as the trend.\n\nIf the length of the input list is greater than or equal to 2, the function sorts the list and compares the first and last temperatures to determine the trend. If the last temperature is greater than the first temperature, the trend is set to `:increasing`. If the last temperature is less than the first temperature, the trend is set to `:decreasing`. If the last and first temperatures are equal, the trend is set to `:stable`. The function then returns a named tuple with the calculated statistics and the determined trend.","status":200,"tokens":[192,479],"elapsed":10.747851958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
