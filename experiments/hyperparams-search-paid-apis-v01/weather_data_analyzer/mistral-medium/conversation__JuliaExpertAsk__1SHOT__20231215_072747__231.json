Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a solution for your request:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max = maximum(temps)\n    min = minimum(temps)\n\n    diffs = diff(sort(temps))\n    trend = if all(diffs .>= 0)\n        :increasing\n    elseif all(diffs .<= 0)\n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=average, max=max, min=min, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input list `temps` is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average, max, and min temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package. Then, it determines the temperature trend by sorting the temperature data and calculating the differences between consecutive elements. If all differences are non-negative, the trend is `:increasing`, if all differences are non-positive, the trend is `:decreasing`, otherwise, the trend is `:stable`. Finally, it returns a named tuple containing the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[192,327],"elapsed":9.981517792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
