Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the Julia code for the required function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n        diff = diff(temps)\n        trend = ifelse(all(diff .> 0), :increasing,\n                       all(diff .< 0), :decreasing,\n                       :stable)\n\n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input list `temps` is empty. If it is, then it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it computes the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package.\n\nNext, it calculates the trend by finding the differences between consecutive elements in the `temps` list using the `diff` function. If all the differences are greater than 0, it sets the trend to `:increasing`. If all the differences are less than 0, it sets the trend to `:decreasing`. Otherwise, it sets the trend to `:stable`.\n\nFinally, the function returns a named tuple containing the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[192,352],"elapsed":7.798821459,"_type":"aimessage"}]
