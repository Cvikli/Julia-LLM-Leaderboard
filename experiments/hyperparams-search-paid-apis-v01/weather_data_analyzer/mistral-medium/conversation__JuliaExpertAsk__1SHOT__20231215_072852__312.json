Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a solution that meets your requirements:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    diff = diff(sort(temps))\n\n    if all(d >= 0 for d in diff)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(d <= 0 for d in diff)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input list `temps` is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures. It then determines the trend by checking the sorted temperature differences. If all differences are non-negative, the trend is `:increasing`. If all differences are non-positive, the trend is `:decreasing`. Otherwise, the trend is `:stable`.","status":200,"tokens":[192,305],"elapsed":8.431667709,"_type":"aimessage"}]
