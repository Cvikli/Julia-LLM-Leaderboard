Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Answer\n\nYou can use the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package to compute the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures respectively. To determine the trend of the temperatures, you can compare the first temperature with the last one. If the first temperature is less than the last, the trend is `:increasing`. If the first temperature is greater than the last, the trend is `:decreasing`. Otherwise, the trend is `:stable`.\n\nHere's an implementation of the `weather_data_analyzer` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average = nothing,\n                 max = nothing,\n                 min = nothing,\n                 trend = nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n        if temps[1] < temps[end]\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif temps[1] > temps[end]\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n\n        return (; average = avg,\n                 max = max_temp,\n                 min = min_temp,\n                 trend = trend)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nYou can then call the `weather_data_analyzer` function with your temperature data to perform the statistical analysis and obtain the results in a named tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[178,290],"elapsed":7.600207792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
