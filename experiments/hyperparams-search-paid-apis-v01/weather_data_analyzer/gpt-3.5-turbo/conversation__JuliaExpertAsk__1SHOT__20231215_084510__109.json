Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Answer\n\nHere is an implementation of the `weather_data_analyzer` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    maximum = maximum(temps)\n    minimum = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if temps[1] < temps[end] && all(diff(temps) .>= 0)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif temps[1] > temps[end] && all(diff(temps) .<= 0)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=average, max=maximum, min=minimum, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis implementation first checks if the `temps` list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the `average`, `max`, and `min` temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package respectively.\n\nThe `trend` is determined by comparing the first and last temperatures in the list and checking if all the differences between consecutive temperatures have the same sign. If the first temperature is lower than the last temperature and all the differences are non-negative, the trend is set to `:increasing`. If the first temperature is higher than the last temperature and all the differences are non-positive, the trend is set to `:decreasing`. Otherwise, the trend is set to `:stable`.\n\nThe results are returned as a named tuple using the `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax.\n\nHope this helps!","status":200,"tokens":[178,365],"elapsed":8.908253417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
