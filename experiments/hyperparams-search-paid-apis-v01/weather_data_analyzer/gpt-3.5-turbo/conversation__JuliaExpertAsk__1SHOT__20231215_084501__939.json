Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Answer\n\nYou can use the `Statistics` package to perform the required statistical analyses on the temperature data. Here's an implementation of the `weather_data_analyzer` function that returns the results as a named tuple:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    maximum = maximum(temps)\n    minimum = minimum(temps)\n    \n    trend = nothing\n    if length(temps) > 1\n        diff = diff(temps)\n        if all(diff .> 0)\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif all(diff .< 0)\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n    end\n    \n    (; average=average, max=maximum, min=minimum, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function handles the case where the `temps` list is empty by returning a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Inside the function, the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package are used to calculate the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures, respectively. The `diff` function is used to calculate the differences between consecutive temperatures, and if all differences are positive, the trend is set to `:increasing`. If all differences are negative, the trend is set to `:decreasing`. Otherwise, the trend is set to `:stable`.\n\nPlease let me know if anything is unclear.","status":200,"tokens":[178,331],"elapsed":7.996322167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
