It then determines the trend by checking if the differences between the consecutive elements in the list are all positive (increasing), all negative (decreasing), or neither (stable). Finally, it returns the results in a named tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[178,215],"elapsed":13.890910625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
