Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Here is the `weather_data_analyzer` function written in Julia.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Determine trend\n    diffs = diff(temps)\n    trend = if all(d -> d > 0, diffs)\n        :increasing\n    elseif all(d -> d < 0, diffs)\n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nTo use this function, pass in a list of daily temperature data (`temps`) like so:\n\n```julia\nresults = weather_data_analyzer([65, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76])\n```\n\nThe `results` will contain the named tuple as per the specified requirements. Just make sure to include the `Statistics` package when running the code.","status":200,"tokens":[178,243],"elapsed":19.747993375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
