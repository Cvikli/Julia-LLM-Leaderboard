Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`).

If the list is empty, it will return `nothing` for each of these values.\n\nThe `trend` is determined by calculating the difference between consecutive temperatures and checking the sign of these differences. If the differences are all positive, the trend is `:increasing`. If the differences are all negative, the trend is `:decreasing`. In any other case, the trend is `:stable`.\n\nThe function returns a named tuple with the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[199,328],"elapsed":4.519039083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
