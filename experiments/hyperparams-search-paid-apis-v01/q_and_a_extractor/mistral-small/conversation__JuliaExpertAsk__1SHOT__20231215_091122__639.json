The function uses the `split` function to split the input string into lines and iterates through the lines. If a line starts with `# Question`, the function sets `question` to the text following the colon, stripped of any leading spaces and newlines. Similarly, if a line starts with `# Answer`, the function sets `answer` to the text following the colon and breaks out of the loop. Finally, the function returns the `question` and `answer` variables as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[141,280],"elapsed":5.322440209,"_type":"aimessage"}]
