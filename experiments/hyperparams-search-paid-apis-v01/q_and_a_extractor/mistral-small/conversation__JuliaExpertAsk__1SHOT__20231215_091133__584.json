The function loops through each line of the input string and checks if it starts with `# Question:` or `# Answer:`. If it finds a line starting with `# Question:`, it sets the `question` variable to the text that follows. If it finds a line starting with `# Answer:`, it sets the `answer` variable to the text that follows and immediately breaks out of the loop. Finally, the function returns the `question` and `answer` variables.\n\nNote that the function uses the `strip` function to remove any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","status":200,"tokens":[141,314],"elapsed":4.380209625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
