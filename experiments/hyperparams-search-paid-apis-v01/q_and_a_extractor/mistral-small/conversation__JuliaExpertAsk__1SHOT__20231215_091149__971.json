Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that should do what you're asking for:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = nothing\n    answer = nothing\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question = strip(split(line, \": \")[2])\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer = strip(split(line, \": \")[2])\n            break\n        end\n    end\n    return question, answer\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the input markdown text `md` into lines and then iterating over each line. If a line starts with `# Question`, it sets the `question` variable to the text following the `# Question` label (after stripping any leading whitespace). Similarly, if a line starts with `# Answer`, it sets the `answer` variable to the text following the `# Answer` label (after stripping any leading whitespace) and then exits the loop.\n\nThe function returns a tuple containing the extracted `question` and `answer`. If the input markdown text does not contain both a `# Question` and `# Answer` section, the corresponding variable will be set to `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[141,283],"elapsed":3.848880917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
