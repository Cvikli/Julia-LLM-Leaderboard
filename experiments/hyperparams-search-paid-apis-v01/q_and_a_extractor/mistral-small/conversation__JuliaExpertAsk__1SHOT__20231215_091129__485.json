If it encounters a line that starts with `# Question`, it sets the current section to `:question` and extracts the question text. If it encounters a line that starts with `# Answer`, it sets the current section to `:answer` and extracts the answer text. Any subsequent lines in the same section are concatenated to the current question or answer. The function returns the final question and answer as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[141,326],"elapsed":7.055887375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
