Initialize `question` and `answer` variables as empty strings.\n2. Find the `# Question` position using `findfirst` function.\n3. If `# Question` is found, find the next occurrence of `# Answer` using `findnext` function starting from the `# Question` position.\n4. If `# Answer` is found, extract the text between `# Question` and `# Answer` and assign it to the `question` variable after stripping leading spaces and newlines.\n5. Extract the text after `# Answer` until the end of the input string and assign it to the `answer` variable after stripping leading spaces and newlines.\n6. Return a tuple `(question, answer)` containing the extracted question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[126,283],"elapsed":6.948554625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
