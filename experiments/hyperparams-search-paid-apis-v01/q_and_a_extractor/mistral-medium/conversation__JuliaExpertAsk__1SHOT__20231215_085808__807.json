The `(?s)` flag makes the `.` character match newlines as well, so that the pattern can match across multiple lines. The `i` flag makes the pattern case-insensitive. The function returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer, with any leading spaces and newlines removed using the `strip` function. If no matching section is found, the function raises an error.","status":200,"tokens":[136,254],"elapsed":17.111386792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
