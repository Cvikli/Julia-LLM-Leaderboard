It uses regular expressions to find the Question and Answer sections and extract the text. The function then strips any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question_regex = r\"(^#\\s+Question\\s+-\\s+(.*)\\n)\"ms\n    answer_regex = r\"(^#\\s+Answer\\s+-\\s+(.*)$)\"ms\n    \n    question_match = match(question_regex, md)\n    answer_match = match(answer_regex, md)\n    \n    if isnothing(question_match) || isnothing(answer_match)\n        error(\"Question or Answer section not found in markdown text.\")\n    end\n    \n    question = strip(question_match.captures[2])\n    answer = strip(answer_match.captures[2])\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n```julia\nmd = \"# Question - What is Julia?\n\nJulia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic language for technical computing.\n\n# Answer - Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic language for technical computing.\"\n\nq_and_a_extractor(md)\n# Output:\n# (\"What is Julia?\", \"Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic language for technical computing.\")\n```\nNote that the regular expressions used in the function assume that the Question and Answer sections are formatted exactly as specified (i.e., starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively, followed by a space, a hyphen, and some text). If the format is different, the regular expressions will need to be adjusted accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[136,419],"elapsed":11.208582667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
