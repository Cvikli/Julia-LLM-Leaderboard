Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution using regular expressions to extract the Question and Answer sections from the given markdown text:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    q_re = r\"(?s)#\\s*Question\\s*.*?\\n(.*?)(?=\\n#\\s*Answer|$)\"\n    a_re = r\"(?s)#\\s*Answer\\s*.*?\\n(.*?)(?=\\n#|$)\"\n\n    q_match = match(q_re, md)\n    a_match = match(a_re, md)\n\n    if isnothing(q_match) || isnothing(a_match)\n        error(\"Question and/or Answer section not found in the markdown text\")\n    end\n\n    question = strip(q_match.captures[1])\n    answer = strip(a_match.captures[1])\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nLet me briefly explain how the function works:\n\n1. We define two regular expressions, `q_re` and `a_re`, to match the Question and Answer sections, respectively. The `(?s)` flag makes the dot character match any character, including newlines.\n2. We use the `match` function to find the first match of each regular expression in the markdown text.\n3. If either the Question or Answer section is not found, we throw an error.\n4. We extract the captured text from each match using the `captures` property.\n5. We strip any leading or trailing whitespace from the extracted text using the `strip` function.\n6. Finally, we return the question and answer as a tuple.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the Question and Answer sections are always present and that each section starts with a `# Question` or `# Answer` header followed by some text. If your use case is more complex, you may need to modify the regular expressions accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[136,441],"elapsed":31.979779375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
