It processes the markdown text line by line, extracting the question and answer sections and storing them in separate arrays. Once all the lines have been processed, the last elements of these arrays are returned as a tuple. The leading spaces and newlines are removed from the extracted text with the `strip` function.","status":200,"tokens":[141,310],"elapsed":2.794314458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
