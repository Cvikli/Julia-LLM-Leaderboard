It first splits the text into lines, then iterates through each line to find the question and answer sections. It checks for the start of a question (`# Question`) and answer (`# Answer`) line, extracts the question text, and the answer text following it. The function ensures that both question and answer are present and returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer. It also strips any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","status":200,"tokens":[141,344],"elapsed":3.568059917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
