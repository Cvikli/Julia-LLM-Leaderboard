Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    # Regex pattern to match Julia code fences\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n((.|\\n)*?)\\n```\"\n    \n    # Find all matches of the pattern in the markdown document\n    matches = eachmatch(pattern, md)\n    \n    # Extract the code blocks and join them together with a newline\n    code_blocks = join([match.captures[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return code_blocks\nend\n```\nThe function uses the `Regex` module to define a regular expression pattern that matches Julia code fences. The pattern matches triple backticks (`````) followed by the word `julia`, a newline, zero or more characters or newlines (non-greedily matched), and finally triple backticks and a newline.\n\nThe function then uses the `eachmatch` function to find all matches of the pattern in the markdown document. For each match, the first capture group (which contains the code block) is extracted and stored in a vector. Finally, the code blocks are joined together with a newline using the `join` function and returned as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[126,301],"elapsed":16.163998791,"_type":"aimessage"}]
