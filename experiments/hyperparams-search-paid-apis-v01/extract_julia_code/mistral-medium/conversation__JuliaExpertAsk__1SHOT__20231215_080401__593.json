Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a potential solution for the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    # Regex pattern to match a Julia code block between triple backticks\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"is\n\n    # Find all matches of the pattern in the markdown string\n    matches = eachmatch(pattern, md)\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the extracted code\n    code = \"\"\n\n    # Iterate through the matches and extract the code blocks\n    for match in matches\n        # Remove the leading and trailing newlines from the code block\n        code_block = chomp(match.captures[1])\n        # Append the code block to the extracted code string,\n        # followed by a newline to separate multiple code blocks\n        code *= code_block * \"\\n\"\n    end\n\n    # Return the extracted code as a string\n    return code\nend\n```\nNote that this function assumes that the input markdown string `md` contains valid Julia code blocks enclosed in triple backticks with the language identifier `julia`. It uses the `eachmatch` function from the `Regex` module to find all matches of the regular expression pattern in the markdown string, and then iterates through the matches to extract the code blocks. Finally, it returns the extracted code as a string with each code block separated by a newline.","status":200,"tokens":[126,332],"elapsed":9.11535675,"_type":"aimessage"}]
