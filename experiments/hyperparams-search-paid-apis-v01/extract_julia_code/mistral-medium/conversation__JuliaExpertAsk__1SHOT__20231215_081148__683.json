[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise. You're precise and answer only when you're confident in the high quality of your answer.","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Question\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    # Match Julia code blocks between triple backticks\n    code_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia\\n(.*)\\n```\"ms, md)\n    # Extract the code from each block and join them with a newline\n    return join([replace(block, r\"\\n$\" => \"\") for block in code_blocks], \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `Regex` module to match Julia code blocks between triple backticks (````julia\\n...\\n````) in the input Markdown document. It then extracts the code from each block by capturing the first matching group (`(.*)`), removes any trailing newlines, and joins the code blocks together with a double newline separator (`\"\\n\\n\"`). The function returns the resulting string.\n\nThe `AbstractString` type is used instead of `String` to allow for more efficient processing of large input documents. The `r\"...\"` raw string literal is used to avoid having to escape backslashes in the regular expression pattern. The `ms` options are used to enable multiline mode and dotall mode, respectively, which allow the `.` character to match newlines and the regular expression to match across multiple lines.","status":200,"tokens":[126,316],"elapsed":37.457467,"_type":"aimessage"}]
