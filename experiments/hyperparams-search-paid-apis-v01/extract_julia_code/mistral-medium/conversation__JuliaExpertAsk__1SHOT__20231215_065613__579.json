Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    # Match triple-backticked Julia code blocks\n    matches = eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md)\n\n    # Extract the code from each match and join them together with newlines\n    code_blocks = [match.captures[1] for match in matches]\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Regex` module to find all code blocks in the markdown document that are enclosed in triple backticks and labeled as Julia code (````julia`). It then extracts the code from each match and joins them together with newlines.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the input is a string containing markdown text and that the markdown syntax for code blocks is used consistently throughout the document. It also assumes that the code blocks do not contain nested triple backticks. If these assumptions are not valid, the function may need to be modified accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[126,250],"elapsed":5.563360583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
