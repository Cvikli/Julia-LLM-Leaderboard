Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Match code blocks with the pattern ```julia\\n...\\n```\n    matches = eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n([\\s\\S]*?)\\n```\"im, md)\n    \n    # Extract the code from each match and join them together\n    code_blocks = map(m -> m.captures[1], matches)\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `eachmatch` function from the `Regex` module to find all occurrences of Julia code blocks in the markdown document, which are defined by triple backticks followed by the word `julia`. The code inside each block is captured using the pattern `([\\s\\S]*?)`, which matches any character (including newlines) non-greedily. The captured code is then extracted using the `captures` property of each match, and all the code blocks are joined together with a newline using the `join` function.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the input markdown document is a string, and that the Julia code blocks are properly formatted with triple backticks and the word `julia`. If the input document does not meet these assumptions, the function may not work correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[126,309],"elapsed":6.810844458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
