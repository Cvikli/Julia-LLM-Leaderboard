[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise. You're precise and answer only when you're confident in the high quality of your answer.","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Question\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    code_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia\\n(.+?)\\n```\", md)\n    return join(map(s -> strip(s), code_blocks), \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Regex` module to match Julia code blocks in the Markdown document. The regular expression `r\"```julia\\n(.+?)\\n```\"` matches any text that is enclosed between triple backticks followed by the word \"julia\" and another set of triple backticks. The `(.+?)` part of the regular expression captures the actual code inside the code block.\n\nThe `matchall` function returns an array of all matches found in the Markdown document. We then use `map` and `strip` to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from each code block, and finally use `join` to concatenate all the code blocks together with a newline character in between.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the Markdown document uses the standard syntax for code blocks in Markdown, which is to enclose the code between triple backticks followed by the name of the programming language. If the document uses a different syntax for code blocks, the regular expression used in this function may need to be modified.","status":200,"tokens":[126,308],"elapsed":8.652490875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
