Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution for the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Find all code blocks using a regular expression\n    code_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s, md)\n    \n    # Extract the code from each code block and join them with a newline\n    code = join([replace(x, r\"\\n\" => \"\\n\") for x in code_blocks], \"\\n\\n\")\n    \n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `Regex` module to find all Julia code blocks in the Markdown document. The regular expression `\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s` matches code blocks that start with ```julia, followed by any number of lines of code, and end with ````. The `(.*?)` captures the code between the fences, and the `s` flag makes the `.` character match newlines as well.\n\nThe `matchall` function returns an array of all matches found in the input string `md`. We then extract the code from each match using a comprehension, and replace any literal newline characters `\\n` with actual newline characters. Finally, we join all the code blocks together with a newline separator, and return the resulting string.","status":200,"tokens":[126,308],"elapsed":37.60916275,"_type":"aimessage"}]
