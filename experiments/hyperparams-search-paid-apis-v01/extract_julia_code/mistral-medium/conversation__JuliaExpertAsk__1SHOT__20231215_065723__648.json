Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function using regular expressions to match and extract Julia code blocks from a Markdown document:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    # Regex pattern to match Julia code blocks\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"is\n    \n    # Find all matches and extract the code blocks\n    code_blocks = matchall(pattern, md)\n    \n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    julia_code = join(map(s -> s.captures[1], code_blocks), \"\\n\")\n    \n    return julia_code\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `Regex` module to define a regular expression pattern that matches Julia code blocks, which are enclosed between triple backticks (`````) and the word `julia`. The `matchall` function is then used to find all matches of this pattern in the input Markdown document, and the code blocks are extracted using the `captures` property of the match objects. Finally, the `join` function is used to concatenate the code blocks together with a newline character (`\"\\n\"`), resulting in a single string containing all the Julia code in the document.","status":200,"tokens":[126,294],"elapsed":13.86762375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
