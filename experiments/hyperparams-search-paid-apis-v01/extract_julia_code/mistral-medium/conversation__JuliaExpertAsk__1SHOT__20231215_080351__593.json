Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution for the `extract_julia_code` function using regular expressions to match and extract Julia code blocks from the markdown document:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"is\n    matches = eachmatch(pattern, md)\n    code_blocks = [match.captures[1] for match in matches]\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThe function uses the `eachmatch` function from the `Regex` module to iterate over all the matches of the Julia code block pattern in the input markdown string. The `pattern` variable contains a regular expression that matches the opening and closing code fences (````julia` and ````) and captures the code block contents in between. The `captures` property of each match object contains a vector of all captured substrings, which we extract and store in the `code_blocks` array. Finally, we use the `join` function to concatenate all the code blocks into a single string, separated by a newline character (`\"\\n\"`).\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the Julia code blocks in the markdown document are well-formed and do not contain any nested code fences. If nested code fences are possible, the regular expression pattern would need to be modified to handle them correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[126,316],"elapsed":7.072852667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
