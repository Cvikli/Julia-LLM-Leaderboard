Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Find all Julia code blocks using regular expressions\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s, md))\n    \n    # Extract the code from each block and join them together with a newline\n    code = join([match.captures[1] for match in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `Regex` module to search for Julia code blocks in the markdown document. It then extracts the code from each block by accessing the first capture group of each match, and joins them together with a newline character using the `join` function. Note that this implementation assumes that the code blocks are properly formatted with triple backticks and the `julia` language identifier. If the markdown document uses a different syntax for code blocks, the regular expression pattern may need to be modified accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[126,245],"elapsed":5.416710375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
