Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of the function `extract_julia_code`:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Match Julia code blocks between triple backticks\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n((.|\\n)*?)```\"\n    matches = eachmatch(pattern, md)\n\n    # Extract and join the code blocks with newline characters\n    code_blocks = [match.captures[1] for match in matches]\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses a regular expression pattern to match Julia code blocks between triple backticks (````julia`). It then extracts the captured code blocks using the `eachmatch` function, which returns an iterator of all matches. Finally, it joins the code blocks together with newline characters using the `join` function, and returns the resulting string. Note that the regular expression pattern uses a non-greedy capture group (`.*?`) to ensure that it matches only the contents of the first code block, and not any subsequent code blocks in the document.","status":200,"tokens":[126,252],"elapsed":5.559559209,"_type":"aimessage"}]
