Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that should do the trick:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    # Match triple-backticked fenced code blocks with Julia language indicator\n    code_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"sm, md)\n    \n    # Extract Julia code from each code block and join them with newline\n    return join([code for code in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `Regex` module to match fenced code blocks with the `julia` language indicator. It then extracts the Julia code from each code block using a capture group and concatenates them with a newline character. The resulting string contains all the Julia code in the markdown document.","status":200,"tokens":[126,186],"elapsed":4.193438292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
