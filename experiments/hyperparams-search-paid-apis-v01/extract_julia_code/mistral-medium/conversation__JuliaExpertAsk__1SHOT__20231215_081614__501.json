[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise. You're precise and answer only when you're confident in the high quality of your answer.","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Question\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation for the function `extract_julia_code`:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    # Regex pattern for matching Julia code fences and code blocks\n    pattern = r\"(?s)```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"\n\n    # Find all matches and extract the code blocks\n    code_blocks = [match.captures[1] for match in eachmatch(pattern, md)]\n\n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `Regex` module to define a regular expression pattern for matching Julia code fences and code blocks. The pattern matches triple backticks followed by the word \"julia\" on the same line, followed by any number of lines (including zero) that don't contain triple backticks, and finally followed by triple backticks on a line by themselves. The `.*?` in the pattern is a non-greedy match that matches as few characters as possible while still satisfying the rest of the pattern.\n\nThe function then uses the `eachmatch` function to find all matches of the pattern in the input markdown string, and extracts the code blocks from each match using the `captures` property. Finally, the function joins the code blocks together with a newline using the `join` function and returns the resulting string.","status":200,"tokens":[126,326],"elapsed":17.756346958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
