Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    # Match Julia code blocks between triple backticks\n    matches = eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n((.|\\n)*?)\\n```\", md)\n    # Extract code blocks and join them with a newline\n    return join([match.captures[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `eachmatch` function from the `Regex` module to find all matches of Julia code blocks in the markdown document. The regular expression pattern `\"```julia\\n((.|\\n)*?)\\n```\"` matches triple backticks followed by the word \"julia\", a newline, any number of characters or newlines (non-greedily), and finally another newline and triple backticks. The `captures` property of each match object contains the extracted code block. The code blocks are then joined together with a newline using the `join` function.","status":200,"tokens":[126,239],"elapsed":6.937831375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
