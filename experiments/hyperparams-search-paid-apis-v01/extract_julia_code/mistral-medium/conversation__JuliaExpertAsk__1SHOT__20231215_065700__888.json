Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution for the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    code_blocks = eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md)\n    return join([match.captures[1] for match in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses the Regex module to search for code blocks in the markdown document that are enclosed between triple backticks and have `julia` as the language identifier. The `eachmatch` function returns an iterator that yields all matches found in the input string, and `match.captures[1]` extracts the actual Julia code from each match. The `join` function is then used to concatenate all the extracted code blocks with a newline separator. The final result is a single string containing all the Julia code in the markdown document.","status":200,"tokens":[126,211],"elapsed":7.096803625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
