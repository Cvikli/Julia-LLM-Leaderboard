Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    code_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"ms, md)\n    return join(map(s -> strip(s), code_blocks), \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Regex` module to find all code blocks that are enclosed in triple backticks with the label `julia`. The regular expression pattern `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"ms` matches one or more lines of code that are sandwiched between the fences, and the `s` modifier allows `.` to match newline characters as well. The `matchall` function returns an array of all matches, and `map` is used to apply the `strip` function to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from each code block. Finally, `join` is used to concatenate all the code blocks into a single string, with a newline character separating each one.","status":200,"tokens":[126,239],"elapsed":5.395301208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
