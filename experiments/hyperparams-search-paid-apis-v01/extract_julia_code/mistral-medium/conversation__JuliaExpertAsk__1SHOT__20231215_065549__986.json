Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution using regular expressions to match Julia code fences and extract the code blocks:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    matches = eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"sm, md)\n    code_blocks = [match.captures[1] for match in matches]\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `eachmatch` function from the `Regex` module to find all matches of the regular expression pattern `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"sm` in the input markdown string. The regular expression pattern matches any occurrence of a Julia code fence (````julia`) followed by zero or more lines of code, up to the closing code fence (`````). The `s` and `m` flags are used to make the regular expression match across multiple lines and treat the input string as a single line, respectively.\n\nThe `eachmatch` function returns an iterator over all matches, and the `captures` property of each match object contains a vector of captured groups. In this case, we're only interested in the first captured group, which contains the code block itself.\n\nThe function then joins all the code blocks together with a newline character (`\\n`) using the `join` function.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the input markdown string is well-formed and contains valid Julia code fences. If the input string is not well-formed or contains malformed code fences, the function may not work correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[126,357],"elapsed":8.018709791,"_type":"aimessage"}]
