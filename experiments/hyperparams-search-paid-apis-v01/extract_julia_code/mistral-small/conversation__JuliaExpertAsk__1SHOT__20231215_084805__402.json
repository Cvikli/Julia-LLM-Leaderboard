Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that should accomplish what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = eachmatch(r\"(```{3}[\\s\\S]*?```{3})\", md)\n    result = String[]\n    for cb in code_blocks\n        code = cb.match[4:end-3]\n        push!(result, code)\n    end\n    return join(result, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `eachmatch` function from the `Regex` module to find all code blocks in the markdown document. It then extracts the code from each code block by removing the leading and trailing triple backticks, and stores the resulting code blocks in an array. Finally, it uses the `join` function to concatenate all the code blocks together with a newline as the separator, and returns the resulting string.","status":200,"tokens":[130,211],"elapsed":2.883656,"_type":"aimessage"}]
