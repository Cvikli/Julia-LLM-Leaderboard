Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that does what you asked:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = []\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    i = 1\n    while i <= length(lines)\n        if lines[i] == \"```julia\"\n            pushfirst!(code_blocks, \"\")\n            j = i + 1\n            while j <= length(lines) && lines[j] != \"```\"\n                push!(code_blocks[end], lines[j])\n                j += 1\n            end\n            deleteat!(lines, i:j)\n        else\n            i += 1\n        end\n    end\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating through each line of the markdown document, and checking if it starts a new code block. If it does, the function adds an empty string to the `code_blocks` array and starts appending lines to it. If the code block ends, the function removes it from the `lines` array and continues iterating. Finally, the function joins all the code blocks together with a newline and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[130,277],"elapsed":3.736759959,"_type":"aimessage"}]
