Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that should accomplish what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    code_blocks = []\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    i = 1\n    while i <= length(lines)\n        if lines[i] == \"```julia\"\n            pushfirst!(code_blocks, \"\")\n            j = i + 1\n            while !(lines[j] == \"```\" || j > length(lines))\n                push!(code_blocks[end], lines[j])\n                j += 1\n            end\n            i = j + 1\n        else\n            i += 1\n        end\n    end\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over the lines of the markdown document and looking for the start of a code block (```julia). When it finds the start of a code block, it pushes an empty string onto the `code_blocks` array, which will be used to accumulate the lines of the code block. Then, it iterates over the following lines until it finds the end of the code block (```). It concatenates each line of the code block onto the last element of `code_blocks`. Finally, it returns the concatenation of all the code blocks with a newline separating them.","status":200,"tokens":[130,318],"elapsed":4.437071709,"_type":"aimessage"}]
