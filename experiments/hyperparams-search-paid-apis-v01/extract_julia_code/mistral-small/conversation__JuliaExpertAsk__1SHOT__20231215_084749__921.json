Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that should accomplish what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    code_blocks = []\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    current_block = IOBuffer()\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            if isopen(current_block)\n                close(current_block)\n            end\n            current_block = IOBuffer()\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && endswith(line, \"julia\")\n            push!(code_blocks, String(take!(current_block)))\n        else\n            write(current_block, line, \"\\n\")\n        end\n    end\n\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each line in the input markdown string. If a line starts with \"```julia\", it indicates the beginning of a new code block, so we close the previous code block (if it exists) and create a new `IOBuffer` to store the current code block. If a line starts with \"```\" and ends with \"julia\", it indicates the end of the current code block, so we add it to our `code_blocks` array. All other lines are written to the current code block's `IOBuffer`. Finally, we join all the code blocks together with a newline and return the resulting string.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the markdown syntax is correct and that each code block is properly fenced with \"```julia\" and \"```\" markdown syntax. If the markdown is not properly formatted, this function may not work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[130,397],"elapsed":6.245758167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
