Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that should accomplish what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    code_blocks = []\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            push!(code_blocks, IOBuffer())\n            continue\n        end\n        if startswith(line, \"```\") && length(code_blocks) > 0\n            takebuf_string(pop!(code_blocks))\n            continue\n        end\n        if length(code_blocks) > 0\n            write(code_blocks[end], line)\n        end\n    end\n    return join(takebuf_string.(code_blocks), \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a loop to iterate through each line in the markdown document. If a line starts with ```julia, it adds a new `IOBuffer` to the `code_blocks` array. If a line starts with ``` and the `code_blocks` array is not empty, it takes the string from the last `IOBuffer` in the array and removes the buffer from the array. If a line is not a code fence, it writes the line to the last `IOBuffer` in the array. Finally, the function uses the `join` function to combine all the code blocks into a single string, separated by a newline.","status":200,"tokens":[130,315],"elapsed":4.168240083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
