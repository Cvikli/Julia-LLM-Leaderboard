Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that should accomplish what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = []\n    current_block = IOBuffer()\n\n    in_code_block = false\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && in_code_block\n            in_code_block = false\n            push!(code_blocks, String(take!(current_block)))\n            empty!(current_block)\n            continue\n        elseif in_code_block\n            write(current_block, line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    # In case the last code block doesn't have a closing fence\n    if !isempty(current_block)\n        push!(code_blocks, String(take!(current_block)))\n    end\n\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function loops through each line of the markdown document, checking if it's the start or end of a code block. If it's the start of a code block, it sets a flag to indicate that we're inside a code block. If it's the end of a code block, it adds the contents of the code block to a list and resets the flag. If we're inside a code block, it writes the line to an `IOBuffer`. Finally, it joins all the code blocks together with a newline and returns the result.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the markdown document is well-formed, i.e. it doesn't check for missing opening or closing fences. If the document is not well-formed, the function may not work correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[130,413],"elapsed":5.561509167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
