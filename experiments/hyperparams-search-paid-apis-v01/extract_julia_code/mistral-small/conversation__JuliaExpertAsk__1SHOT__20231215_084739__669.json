Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that should accomplish what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = []\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            pushfirst!(code_blocks, \"\")\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\")\n            pop!(code_blocks)\n            continue\n        end\n        if !isempty(code_blocks)\n            push!(code_blocks[end], line)\n        end\n    end\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each line in the markdown document, checking if the line is a code fence (i.e. starts with \"```julia\"). If it is, it starts a new code block by pushing an empty string onto the `code_blocks` array. If the line is a closing code fence (i.e. starts with \"```\" but not \"```julia\"), it removes the most recently added code block from the `code_blocks` array. If the line is not a code fence, but there are currently any code blocks being tracked, it appends the line to the current code block. Finally, the function returns the concatenation of all the code blocks with a newline separating each one.","status":200,"tokens":[130,317],"elapsed":6.22014,"_type":"aimessage"}]
