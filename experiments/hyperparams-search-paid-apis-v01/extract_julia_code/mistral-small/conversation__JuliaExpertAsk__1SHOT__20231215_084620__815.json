[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise.

Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that should accomplish what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = []\n    current_block = IOBuffer()\n\n    in_code_block = false\n\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && in_code_block\n            in_code_block = false\n            push!(code_blocks, String(take!(current_block)))\n            empty!(current_block)\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if in_code_block\n            write(current_block, line * \"\\n\")\n        end\n    end\n\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function iterates through each line of the markdown document. If it encounters a line that starts with ```julia, it sets the `in_code_block` flag to true. If it encounters a line that starts with ``` and `in_code_block` is true, it sets `in_code_block` to false, saves the current code block to the `code_blocks` array, and clears the `current_block` buffer. If `in_code_block` is true, it writes the current line to the `current_block` buffer.\n\nFinally, it joins all the code blocks in the `code_blocks` array with a newline and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[130,361],"elapsed":4.898916792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
