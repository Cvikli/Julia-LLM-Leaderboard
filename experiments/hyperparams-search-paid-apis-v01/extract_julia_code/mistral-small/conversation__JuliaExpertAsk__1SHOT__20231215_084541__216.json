Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that should accomplish what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = []\n    current_block = IOBuffer()\n\n    in_code_block = false\n\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if startswith(line, \"`{3}\\n\")\n            in_code_block = true\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if in_code_block\n            write(current_block, line)\n\n            if endswith(line, \"`{3}\\n\")\n                push!(code_blocks, String(take!(current_block)))\n                in_code_block = false\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function iterates over each line in the markdown document and checks if it is the start of a code block (i.e. if it starts with ``` on its own line). If it is, the function sets a flag to indicate that we are inside a code block and starts accumulating the lines of the code block in a `IOBuffer`. When the function encounters the end of a code block (i.e. a line that ends with ``` on its own line), it adds the contents of the buffer to a list of code blocks and resets the flag and buffer. Finally, the function joins all the code blocks together with a newline character and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[130,336],"elapsed":4.480456458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
