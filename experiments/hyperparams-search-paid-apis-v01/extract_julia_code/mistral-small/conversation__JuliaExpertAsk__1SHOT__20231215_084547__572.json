Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that should accomplish what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = []\n    current_block = IOBuffer()\n\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            if isopen(current_block)\n                push!(code_blocks, String(take!(current_block)))\n            end\n            current_block = IOBuffer()\n        elseif endswith(line, \"```\") && startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            print(current_block, line[10:end-3])\n            push!(code_blocks, String(take!(current_block)))\n            current_block = IOBuffer()\n        else\n            print(current_block, line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    if isopen(current_block)\n        push!(code_blocks, String(take!(current_block)))\n    end\n\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function iterates through each line of the input markdown document. When it encounters a code block fence (```julia), it checks if there is already an open code block. If there is, it saves the current code block to the `code_blocks` array and opens a new code block. If there isn't, it just opens a new code block.\n\nWhen it encounters the end of a code block (```), it saves the current code block to the `code_blocks` array and opens a new code block. If the end fence and the start fence are the same, this means that we have reached the end of the markdown document, and we need to save the last open code block to the `code_blocks` array before returning the result.\n\nFinally, the function returns a single string with all the code blocks joined together with a newline.","status":200,"tokens":[130,443],"elapsed":5.983215834,"_type":"aimessage"}]
