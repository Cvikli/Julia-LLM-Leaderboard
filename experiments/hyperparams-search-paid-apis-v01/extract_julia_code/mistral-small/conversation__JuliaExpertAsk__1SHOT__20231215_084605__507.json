Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that does what you're looking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = eachmatch(r\"(```{3}(jl|julia)\\s*\\n([\\s\\S]*?)\\s*```{3})\", md)\n    result = String[]\n    for cb in code_blocks\n        push!(result, cb.match[3:end])\n    end\n    return join(result, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to extract the Julia code blocks from the markdown document, and then joins them together with a newline character. Note that the regular expression looks for triple backticks followed by the language name `jl` or `julia`, and captures everything between that and the closing triple backticks. The result is then joined into a single string, which is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[130,210],"elapsed":2.9058775,"_type":"aimessage"}]
