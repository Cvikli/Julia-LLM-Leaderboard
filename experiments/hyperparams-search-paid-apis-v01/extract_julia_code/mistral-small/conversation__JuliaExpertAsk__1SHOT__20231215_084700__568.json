Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that should do what you're asking:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = eachmatch(r\"(```[jlJL][\\s\\S]*?```)\", md)\n    result = String[]\n    for cb in code_blocks\n        strip(cb.match)[4:end-3] |> push! |> pop!(result)\n    end\n    return join(result, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `eachmatch` function to find all code blocks in the markdown document. It then removes the first three and last three characters (the `` `s) from each code block and adds the resulting string to a result array. Finally, it joins the elements of the result array into a single string with newlines in between.","status":200,"tokens":[130,194],"elapsed":2.684951875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
