Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that does what you described:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = []\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    current_block = IOBuffer()\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            if isopen(current_block)\n                push!(code_blocks, take!(current_block))\n            end\n            current_block = IOBuffer()\n        elseif endswith(line, \"```\")\n            if isopen(current_block)\n                write(current_block, line[1:end-3])\n                push!(code_blocks, take!(current_block))\n            end\n            current_block = IOBuffer()\n        else\n            if isopen(current_block)\n                write(current_block, line, '\\n')\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    if isopen(current_block)\n        push!(code_blocks, take!(current_block))\n    end\n\n    return join(code_blocks, '\\n')\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each line in the input markdown string and checking if it starts or ends with a Julia code fence (i.e., \"```julia\" or \"```\" respectively). If it finds a starting fence, it creates a new `IOBuffer` to store the code block. If it finds an ending fence, it writes the code block to an array of strings and closes the `IOBuffer`. Finally, it returns a single string with all the code blocks concatenated together with a newline character.","status":200,"tokens":[130,384],"elapsed":5.131184084,"_type":"aimessage"}]
