Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that does what you're looking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = eachmatch(r\"(```{3}(jl|julia)\\r?\\n([\\s\\S]*?)\\r?\\n(```{3})\", md)\n    result = String[]\n    for cb in code_blocks\n        push!(result, cb.captures[2])\n    end\n    return join(result, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `eachmatch` function from the `Regex` module to find all code blocks in the markdown document. It then extracts the code from each code block and stores it in an array. Finally, it joins all the code blocks together with a newline and returns the result. Note that this function assumes that the code blocks are written in Julia (indicated by the `jl` or `julia` language specifier), and it removes the code fences (the triple backticks) from the code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[130,244],"elapsed":3.363566708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
