Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that does what you described:\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::Markdown.MD)\n    code_blocks = Markdown.parse_blocks(md) do block\n        return block isa Markdown.CodeBlock && block.lang == \"julia\"\n    end\n    return join(code_blocks .|> Markdown.unescape .|> String, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nIt takes a parsed Markdown document as input and returns a string containing all the Julia code blocks joined together with a newline. It uses the `Markdown.parse_blocks` function to extract the code blocks, and then joins them together using the `join` function with a newline as the separator.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the input is a valid Markdown document, and that all code blocks are properly fenced. If that's not the case, the function may not work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[130,217],"elapsed":4.292394625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
