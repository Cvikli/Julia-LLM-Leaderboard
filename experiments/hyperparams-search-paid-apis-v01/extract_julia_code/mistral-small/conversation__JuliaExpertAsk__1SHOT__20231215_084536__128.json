Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that should accomplish what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks =[]\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    current_block = IOBuffer()\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            if !isempty(current_block)\n                push!(code_blocks, String(take!(current_block)))\n            end\n            current_block = IOBuffer()\n        elseif endswith(line, \"```\") && occursin(\"julia\", line)\n            print(current_block, line[1:end-3])\n            push!(code_blocks, String(take!(current_block)))\n            current_block = IOBuffer()\n        else\n            print(current_block, line, '\\n')\n        end\n    end\n\n    if !isempty(current_block)\n        push!(code_blocks, String(take!(current_block)))\n    end\n\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each line in the input markdown string. If a line starts with ```julia, the function opens a new `IOBuffer` to start storing the code block. When a line ends with ``` and contains the string \"julia\", the function closes the current buffer and adds its contents to a list of code blocks. Finally, the function joins all the code blocks together with a newline and returns the result.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the input markdown string is well-formed and contains valid code blocks. If the input may contain syntax errors or invalid code blocks, you may need to modify the function to handle those cases.","status":200,"tokens":[130,406],"elapsed":5.342449125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
