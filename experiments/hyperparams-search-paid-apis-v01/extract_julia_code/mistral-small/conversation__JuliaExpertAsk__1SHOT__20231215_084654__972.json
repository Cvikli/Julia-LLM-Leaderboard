[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise.

Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that should accomplish what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    code_blocks = []\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            push!(code_blocks, \"\")\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && !isempty(code_blocks)\n            break\n        elseif !isempty(code_blocks)\n            push!(code_blocks[end], line)\n        end\n    end\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `eachline` function to iterate over each line in the markdown document `md`. If a line starts with ```julia, the function adds an empty string to the `code_blocks` array, indicating the start of a new code block. If a line starts with ``` and the `code_blocks` array is not empty, the function breaks out of the loop, since this indicates the end of the last code block. If a line does not start with ```, the function adds it to the current code block in the `code_blocks` array.\n\nFinally, the function returns a string made by joining all the code blocks in the `code_blocks` array with a newline character.","status":200,"tokens":[130,300],"elapsed":4.073119333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
