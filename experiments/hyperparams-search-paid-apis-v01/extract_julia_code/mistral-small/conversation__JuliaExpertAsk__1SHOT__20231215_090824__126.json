Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that should accomplish what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = []\n    current_block = IOBuffer()\n\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            if !isempty(current_block)\n                push!(code_blocks, take!(current_block))\n            end\n            current_block = IOBuffer()\n        elseif endswith(line, \"```\") && startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            print(current_block, line[10:end-3])\n            push!(code_blocks, take!(current_block))\n            current_block = IOBuffer()\n        else\n            print(current_block, line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    if !isempty(current_block)\n        push!(code_blocks, take!(current_block))\n    end\n\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a markdown string `md` as input, and initializes two variables: `code_blocks` which is an empty array to store the extracted code blocks, and `current_block` which is an `IOBuffer` to store the current code block being processed.\n\nThe function then iterates over each line in the markdown string, checking if the line starts with \"```julia\" to indicate the start of a code block. If a code block is detected, the function checks if there is any previous content in the `current_block` variable. If there is, it pushes it to the `code_blocks` array. It then resets the `current_block` variable to a new `IOBuffer` to start storing the new code block.\n\nIf the line ends with \"```\" and starts with \"```julia\", it indicates the end of a code block. The function prints the line to the `current_block` variable, removes the \"```julia\" prefix, and pushes the `current_block` to the `code_blocks` array. It then resets the `current_block` variable to a new `IOBuffer` to start storing the new code block.\n\nIf the line does not start with \"```julia\" or end with \"```\", it just prints the line to the `current_block` variable.\n\nAfter iterating over all the lines, the function checks if there is any remaining content in the `current_block` variable. If there is, it pushes it to the `code_blocks` array.\n\nFinally, the function joins all the code blocks in the `code_blocks` array with a newline (\"\\n\\n\") and returns the resulting string.","status":200,"tokens":[130,638],"elapsed":8.529910708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
