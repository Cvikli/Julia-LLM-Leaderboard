Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that should accomplish what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = []\n    current_block = IOBuffer()\n\n    in_code_block = false\n\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if startswith(line, \"```\") && in_code_block\n            in_code_block = false\n            push!(code_blocks, String(take!(current_block)))\n            current_block = IOBuffer()\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if in_code_block\n            write(current_block, line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a simple state machine to keep track of whether or not it is currently inside a Julia code block. When it encounters the start of a code block, it sets the `in_code_block` flag to `true` and starts accumulating lines in the `current_block` buffer. When it encounters the end of a code block, it adds the contents of `current_block` to the `code_blocks` array and resets `current_block` to a new, empty buffer. Finally, it returns a string obtained by joining all the code blocks in the array with a newline character.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the markdown document is well-formed and has no unmatched code fences. If that's not the case, the function may not behave as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[130,378],"elapsed":5.016777167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
