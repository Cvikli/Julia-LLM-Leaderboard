Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that extracts Julia code from a markdown document:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    code_blocks = []\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            push!(code_blocks, \"\")\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && !isempty(code_blocks)\n            break\n        elseif !isempty(code_blocks)\n            push!(code_blocks[end], line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each line in the markdown document. When it encounters a line that starts with ```julia, it pushes an empty string onto a stack `code_blocks`. This empty string will be used to accumulate the lines of code in the current code block.\n\nWhen the function encounters a line that starts with ``` and the stack is not empty, it knows that it has reached the end of a code block. It breaks out of the loop to avoid processing any further lines.\n\nFor all other lines, if the stack is not empty, it appends the line to the current code block (which is the last element of the stack).\n\nFinally, the function returns a string that is the result of joining all the code blocks with a newline character.","status":200,"tokens":[130,318],"elapsed":4.289738,"_type":"aimessage"}]
