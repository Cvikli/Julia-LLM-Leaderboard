Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that should accomplish what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    code_blocks = []\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    current_block = IOBuffer()\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            if isopen(current_block)\n                close(current_block)\n            end\n            current_block = IOBuffer()\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && endswith(line, \"julia\")\n            push!(code_blocks, String(take!(current_block)))\n        else\n            write(current_block, line, \"\\n\")\n        end\n    end\n\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating through each line of the markdown document, checking if the line indicates the start or end of a code block. If it's the start of a code block, it closes and clears the previous code block (if one exists), and creates a new `IOBuffer` to store the current code block. If it's the end of a code block, it adds the contents of the `IOBuffer` to a list of code blocks. If it's neither the start nor end of a code block, it simply writes the line to the current `IOBuffer`. Finally, it joins all the code blocks together with a newline and returns the resulting string.","status":200,"tokens":[130,343],"elapsed":4.603134958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
