Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that should do what you're asking:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = []\n    current_block = IOBuffer()\n\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            if !isempty(current_block)\n                push!(code_blocks, take!(current_block))\n            end\n            current_block = IOBuffer()\n        elseif endswith(line, \"```\") && startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            print(current_block, line[11:end-3])\n            push!(code_blocks, take!(current_block))\n            current_block = IOBuffer()\n        else\n            print(current_block, line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    if !isempty(current_block)\n        push!(code_blocks, take!(current_block))\n    end\n\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating through each line of the input markdown string. If it encounters a line that starts with \"```julia\", it starts a new code block. If it encounters a line that ends with \"```\" and starts with \"```julia\", it ends the current code block and starts a new one. If it encounters any other line, it simply adds it to the current code block.\n\nOnce all the lines have been processed, the function joins all the code blocks together with a newline character, and returns the resulting string.\n\nNote that this function assumes that there are no empty code blocks in the input markdown. If there are, you may need to add some additional error checking to handle this case.","status":200,"tokens":[130,413],"elapsed":5.581615291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
