Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that should accomplish what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = []\n    current_block = IOBuffer()\n\n    in_code_block = false\n\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && in_code_block\n            in_code_block = false\n            push!(code_blocks, String(take!(current_block)))\n            empty!(current_block)\n            continue\n        elseif in_code_block\n            write(current_block, line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each line in the input markdown document. If a line starts with ```julia, the function sets the `in_code_block` variable to `true` to indicate that we are now inside a code block. If a line starts with ``` and we are currently inside a code block, the function sets `in_code_block` to `false` to indicate that we have exited the code block, pushes the current code block to the `code_blocks` array, and empties the `current_block` buffer. If we are currently inside a code block, the function writes the line to the `current_block` buffer.\n\nFinally, the function joins all the code blocks in the `code_blocks` array with a newline character and returns the resulting string.","status":200,"tokens":[130,373],"elapsed":5.035906208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
