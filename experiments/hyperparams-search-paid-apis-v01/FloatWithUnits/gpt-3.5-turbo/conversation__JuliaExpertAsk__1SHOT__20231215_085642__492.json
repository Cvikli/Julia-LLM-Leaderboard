Here's an example implementation:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, data::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, data.value, \" \", data.unit)\nend\n```\n\nNow, when you call `show` on an instance of `FloatWithUnits`, it will display the value and unit separated by a space.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\nx = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nshow(x)  # Output: 1.8 meters\n```\n\nRemember to replace `FloatWithUnits` with your actual struct name and modify the field types if needed.","status":200,"tokens":[105,182],"elapsed":4.501428667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
