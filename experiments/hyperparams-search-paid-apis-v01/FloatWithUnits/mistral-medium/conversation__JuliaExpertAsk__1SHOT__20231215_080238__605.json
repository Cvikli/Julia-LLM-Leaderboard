The `show` method is then defined for this struct using the `Base.show` function. This function takes an `IO` stream and a `FloatWithUnits` instance as arguments and prints the `value` field followed by a space and the `unit` field to the `IO` stream.\n\nFor example, if we create a new `FloatWithUnits` instance like this:\n```\njulia> f = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nFloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n```\nWe can then call the `show` method on it like this:\n```\njulia> show(f)\n\"1.8 meters\"\n```\nOr we can print it to the console like this:\n```\njulia> println(f)\n1.8 meters\n```\nAlternatively, you can use the following `show` method definition which uses string interpolation instead of concatenation:\n```\nBase.show(io::IO, f::FloatWithUnits) = print(io, \"$(f.value) $(f.unit)\")\n```\nBoth of these approaches will produce the same output.","status":200,"tokens":[113,360],"elapsed":7.925831833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
