If the word starts with an uppercase letter, the lambda function returns `true`, indicating that the word should be included in the filtered array. Otherwise, it returns `false`, indicating that the word should be excluded.\n\nHere are some example usage cases:\n```julia\njulia> words = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\", \"bird\", \"BIRD\"]\n9-element Array{String,1}:\n \"Dog\"\n \"dog\"\n \"Cat\"\n \"cat\"\n \"bird\"\n \"BIRD\"\n\njulia> keep_only_names(words)\n3-element Array{String,1}:\n \"Dog\"\n \"Cat\"\n \"BIRD\"\n\njulia> words = [\"apple\", \"Banana\", \"grape\", \"Apricot\", \"Orange\"]\n5-element Array{String,1}:\n \"apple\"\n \"Banana\"\n \"grape\"\n \"Apricot\"\n \"Orange\"\n\njulia> keep_only_names(words)\n3-element Array{String,1}:\n \"Banana\"\n \"Apricot\"\n \"Orange\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[109,416],"elapsed":5.621636791,"_type":"aimessage"}]
