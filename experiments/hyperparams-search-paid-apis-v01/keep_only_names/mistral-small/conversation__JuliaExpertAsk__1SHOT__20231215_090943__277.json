The `startswith` function checks if a word starts with a specific character (in this case, the first character in uppercase), and returns `true` or `false` accordingly. The `filter!` function uses this information to filter the input list.\n\nThe `return` statement is not strictly necessary, since `filter!` already returns the filtered list. However, I included it to make it clear that the function returns the filtered list.","status":200,"tokens":[109,193],"elapsed":2.767766041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
