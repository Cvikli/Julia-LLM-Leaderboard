The `startswith` function is used to check if a word starts with a capital letter.\n\nHowever, this solution assumes that the input is an array of strings. If the input is a `Vector{String}` or any other type of collection that implements the `AbstractVector` interface, you can simplify the function as follows:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filter(word -> startswith(word, capitalcase(word)[1]), words)\nend\n```\nThis version of the function checks if the first character of each word is a capital letter by comparing it to the first character of the word in capital case (using the `capitalcase` function). This solution is more concise and works with any type of collection that implements the `AbstractVector` interface.","status":200,"tokens":[109,547],"elapsed":7.432747416,"_type":"aimessage"}]
