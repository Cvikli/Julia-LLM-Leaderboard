The condition checks if the word starts with an uppercase letter (`startswith(word, uppercase(word[1]))` returns `true` if the word starts with the same letter as its first character in uppercase). The `!` in `filter!` indicates that the original array should be modified in place, instead of creating a new array.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the input is an array of strings. If the input can be in a different format, you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[109,208],"elapsed":2.799656958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
