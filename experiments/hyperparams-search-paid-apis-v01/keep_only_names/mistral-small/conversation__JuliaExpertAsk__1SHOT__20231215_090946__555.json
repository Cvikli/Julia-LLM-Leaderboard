The `filter!` function iterates over the input list and applies the provided predicate function to each element. If the predicate function returns `true`, the element is included in the output list; otherwise, it is excluded.\n\nNote that this function modifies the input list in place and returns it as the result. If you prefer to keep the original list unchanged, you can make a copy of it before calling `keep_only_names` or modify the function to create a new list as the output.","status":200,"tokens":[109,234],"elapsed":3.207602084,"_type":"aimessage"}]
