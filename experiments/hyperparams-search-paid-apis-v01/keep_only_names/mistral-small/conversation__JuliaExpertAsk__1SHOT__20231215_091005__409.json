The `startswith` function checks if a word starts with a certain character, and `uppercase(word[1])` converts the first letter of the word to uppercase so that it can be compared correctly. The exclamation mark after `filter` indicates that the function modifies the input list directly instead of creating a new one.\n\nHere's an example of how you could use this function:\n```julia\njulia> words = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"bird\", \"elephant\", \"ant\"]\n5-element Vector{String}:\n \"Dog\"\n \"cat\"\n \"bird\"\n \"elephant\"\n \"ant\"\n\njulia> keep_only_names(words)\n3-element Vector{String}:\n \"Dog\"\n \"elephant\"\n \"ant\"\n```\nAs you can see, the `keep_only_names` function removes all words that do not start with a capital letter, leaving only those that do.","status":200,"tokens":[109,322],"elapsed":4.315817916,"_type":"aimessage"}]
