# Frequently Asked Questions

## Adding More Models? 
In short term, we don't foresee adding more models, unless there is some transformative new option that runs on consumer hardware. 

If you want to add the benchmark for some specific model, submit your evals in a PR.

## Whatâ€™s Next?
We'd like to add more tests and, potentially, also types of tests (code questions).
It would be good to grow the number of prompt templates tested, as those are more versatile.
