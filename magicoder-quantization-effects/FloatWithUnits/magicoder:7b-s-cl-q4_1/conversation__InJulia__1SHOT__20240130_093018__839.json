The `show` function is called whenever you print this type to the console.\n\nThe function `Base.show(io::IO, x::FloatWithUnits)` is what allows us to define custom output for our objects in Julia. In this case, we're printing out the value and unit of our FloatWithUnits object.","status":200,"tokens":[0,241],"elapsed":1.919749219,"_type":"aimessage"}]
