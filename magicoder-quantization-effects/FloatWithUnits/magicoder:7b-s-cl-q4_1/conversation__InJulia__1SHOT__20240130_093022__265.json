Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T} <: Real\n    value::T\n    unit::String\nend\n```\n\nNext step is to write a `show` method for this struct. This function will concatenate the value and unit with a space when called on an instance of the struct. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nimport Base: show\nfunction show(io::IO, x::FloatWithUnits{T}) where {T<:Real}\n    print(io, x.value)\n    print(io, \" \")\n    print(io, x.unit)\nend\n```\n\nLet's test the method with an instance of `FloatWithUnits`.\n\n```julia\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nshow(stdout, f)  # outputs: 1.8 meters\n```\nThis should display the value and unit in the specified format when called on an instance of this struct.","status":200,"tokens":[0,249],"elapsed":1.984730191,"_type":"aimessage"}]
