Inside it, we have two fields: `value`, which is of type `Float64` (a 64-bit floating point number), and `unit`, which is of type `String`.\n\nThe function `Base.show` is a built-in Julia function that defines how an object should be printed in the REPL or other I/O contexts. For our `FloatWithUnits` objects, we want to print out the value and unit separated by a space. This is done with the `print(io, \"$(f.value) $(f.unit)\")`.\n\nThis show function can be used in the following way: \n```julia\njulia> x = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[105,268],"elapsed":2.139951545,"_type":"aimessage"}]
