For this example, let's start with creating our `FloatWithUnits` struct:\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T<:Real} \n    value::T\n    unit::String\nend\n```\nNow let's define the `show` method for it. The default behavior of `show` is to print each field in a new line, but we can customize this by defining our own function:\n```julia\nfunction show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits) \n    println(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\") \nend\n```\nThis will print the value and unit side-by-side, which is how you'd typically see units in a human readable format.","status":200,"tokens":[0,185],"elapsed":1.472557676,"_type":"aimessage"}]
