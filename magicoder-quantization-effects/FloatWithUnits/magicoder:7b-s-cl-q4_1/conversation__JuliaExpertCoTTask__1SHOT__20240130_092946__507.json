This is equivalent to an abstract type in other languages like Java or C++. You can use concrete types like `Float64`, `Int32`, etc., instead of the generic type parameter `T`.\n- The `show(io::IO, f::FloatWithUnits)` function is a method for displaying `FloatWithUnits` objects in Julia's REPL. Here `io` is an I/O stream (like the one you see in your terminal), and `f` is an instance of `FloatWithUnits`.\n- Inside this function, we use the built-in `write()` function to write a string directly into our I/O stream. We format our string using the fields of the struct `f`, concatenating `f.value` (which holds the value) and `f.unit` (the unit).\n\nTo test this code, you can use something like:\n```julia\njulia> FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,338],"elapsed":2.764057656,"_type":"aimessage"}]
