Then it defines a function `show` which is called when we want to convert an object of this type to a string (e.g., in the REPL). The method uses `print` to write the concatenation of `fwu.value` and `fwu.unit` separated by a space into `io`.\n\nNote that `T<:Real` means \"T is a subtype of Real\" which ensures that the value can only be either an integer or a floating-point number.","status":200,"tokens":[0,215],"elapsed":1.710619958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
