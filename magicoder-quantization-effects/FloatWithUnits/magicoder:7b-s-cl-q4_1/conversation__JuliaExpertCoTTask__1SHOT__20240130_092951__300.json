Define your struct:\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T <: Number}\n    value::T\n    unit::String\nend\n```\n\n2. Implement the `show` function for your struct:\n```julia\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, u::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(u.value) $(u.unit)\")\nend\n```\nThis will print something like \"1.8 meters\" if you use `show` on a FloatWithUnits object. \n\n3. Test the implementation with your example:\n```julia\njulia> x = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,178],"elapsed":1.399818938,"_type":"aimessage"}]
