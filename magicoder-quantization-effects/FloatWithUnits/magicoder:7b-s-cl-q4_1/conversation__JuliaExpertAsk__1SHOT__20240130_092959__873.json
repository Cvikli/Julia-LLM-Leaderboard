We define a new struct called `FloatWithUnits`. It takes any type of real number (`T<:Real`) as the value and a string for the unit. \n2. We then write a function `show` that formats the object into a string that includes the value and unit separated by a space. The `write` function writes textual content to an I/O stream, and the `io` argument is an instance of IO. This method is called automatically whenever we try to print an object of type `FloatWithUnits`.\n\nYou can then use this struct like so:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # prints: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,283],"elapsed":2.240700984,"_type":"aimessage"}]
