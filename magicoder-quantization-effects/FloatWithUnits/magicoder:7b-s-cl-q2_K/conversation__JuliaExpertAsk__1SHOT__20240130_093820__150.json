Value is of type `T <: Real` which means it's going to be any real number (Float64, Float32 etc.).\n  \n- Then we create a new method `show` for the IO stream with given IO `io` and our `FloatWithUnits`. We print the value and unit of our FloatWithUnits object.\n   \nPlease note that this is a very basic implementation. For example, it doesn't take into account any kind of formatting or special characters in your string representation. Depending on what you want to achieve with the show method for FloatWithUnits, you might need to expand on this code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,253],"elapsed":1.925121542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
