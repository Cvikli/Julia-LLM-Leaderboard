The first argument `io::IO`, is where the result gets printed (typically the console). The second argument `fwu::FloatWithUnits` is the FloatWithUnits instance that we want to display.\n\nNote: For this code to work, you should also define the struct FloatWithUnits with fields value and unit at first place.","status":200,"tokens":[0,182],"elapsed":1.387579733,"_type":"aimessage"}]
