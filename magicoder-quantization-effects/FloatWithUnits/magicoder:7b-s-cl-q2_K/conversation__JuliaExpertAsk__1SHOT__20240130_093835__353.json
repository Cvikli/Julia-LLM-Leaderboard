The first parameter `T` represents the type of the value in your units (like `Float64`, `Int32`, etc).\n- `Base.show(io::IO, u::FloatWithUnits)` is the function that defines how `FloatWithUnits` instances should be printed to the console. In this case, it concatenates the value and unit with a space in between using the `print` function. The `io::IO` argument is used for outputting the result.\n\nYou can now create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and use `show` on it like this:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprint(fwu) # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,275],"elapsed":2.114277568,"_type":"aimessage"}]
