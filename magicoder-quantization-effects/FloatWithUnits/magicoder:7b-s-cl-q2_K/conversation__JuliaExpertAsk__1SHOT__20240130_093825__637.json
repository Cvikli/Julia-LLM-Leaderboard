Here is how you can do this:\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T} <: Real\n    value::T\nend\n\nstruct Unit\n  name::AbstractString\n  symbol::AbstractString\nend\n\n# Define the show method for FloatWithUnits. It uses a helper function to build the string representation of the unit and value.\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, x::FloatWithUnits)\n    println(io, \" \", x.value, \" \", unit_string(x)) # Use unit_string() method\nend\n\n# Define the show method for Unit\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, u::Unit)\n    print(io, \"$(u.symbol) \")\nend\n\n# Helper function to get the string representation of the unit\nfunction unit_string(x::FloatWithUnits{T}) where {T<:Real}\n  return \"meters\" # Assume that all units are in meters for this example\nend\n```\nIn this code, `unit_string()` method is used to get the string representation of the unit. You can extend it as per your needs. The `FloatWithUnits` and `Unit` structs are defined with their respective `show` methods.\n\nWhen you print an object of type `FloatWithUnits`, its `value` and the result of `unit_string()` method (here \"meters\") will be concatenated by a space to produce a string that represents it. Similarly, when you print an object of type `Unit`, only its symbol (\"m\" in this case) is printed as unit of measurement. \n\nNote: This code assumes that all units are in meters for simplicity and doesn't handle multiple units or more complex scenarios. For a robust solution, you might need to write more sophisticated methods for handling such cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,419],"elapsed":3.189231214,"_type":"aimessage"}]
