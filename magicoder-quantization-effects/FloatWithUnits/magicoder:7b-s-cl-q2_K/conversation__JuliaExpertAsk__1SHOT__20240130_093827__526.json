We need to override this method using `@auto_hash` decorator in order to generate the automatic hash function:\n\n```julia\nBase.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits) = print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\n```\nThe `Base.show` method gets called when you try to convert a FloatWithUnits instance into a string using the `println` function. \n\nHere's an example of how you can test this:\n\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprint(fwu) # Prints: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,223],"elapsed":1.68518882,"_type":"aimessage"}]
