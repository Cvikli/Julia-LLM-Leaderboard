We then implement a method for showing these units using the built-in `Base.show` function in Julia. This function will print the value followed by a space and then the unit. In our test, we create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` with a value of 1.8 and a unit of \"meters\" and it is printed as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[0,213],"elapsed":1.846122183,"_type":"aimessage"}]
