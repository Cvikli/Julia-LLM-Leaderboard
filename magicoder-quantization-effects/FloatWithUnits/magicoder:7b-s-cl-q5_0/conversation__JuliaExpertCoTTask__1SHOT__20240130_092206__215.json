Here's how you could do it:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T <: AbstractFloat}\n    value::T\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, x::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, x.value, \" \", x.unit)\nend\n```\n\nThis `show` function takes in an `IO` object (which represents the output stream for IO operations), a `FloatWithUnits` object (`x`), and prints out the value followed by a space and then the unit.\n\nNow if you create an instance of `FloatWithUnits`, like `FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")`, calling `show(io, x)` where `io` is your output stream (like `stdout`) would print out `1.8 meters`.","status":200,"tokens":[230,215],"elapsed":3.65875203,"_type":"aimessage"}]
