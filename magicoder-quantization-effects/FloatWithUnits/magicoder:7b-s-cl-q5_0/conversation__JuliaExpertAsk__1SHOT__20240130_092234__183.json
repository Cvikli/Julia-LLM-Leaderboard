Then, we define a `show` method for `FloatWithUnits`. This method takes an I/O stream (`io::IO`) and a `FloatWithUnits` object (`u`). Inside the function, it uses the built-in `print` function to print the value and unit. The printed result is wrapped in a string to ensure there's a space between the number and its unit.","status":200,"tokens":[0,195],"elapsed":1.673863927,"_type":"aimessage"}]
