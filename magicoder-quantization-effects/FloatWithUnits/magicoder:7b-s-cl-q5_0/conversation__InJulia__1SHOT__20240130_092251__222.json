The function concatenates the value and unit with a space and writes it out. \n\nHere's how you can create an instance of `FloatWithUnits`:\n```julia\na = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(a) # Output: \"1.8 meters\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,204],"elapsed":1.736805423,"_type":"aimessage"}]
