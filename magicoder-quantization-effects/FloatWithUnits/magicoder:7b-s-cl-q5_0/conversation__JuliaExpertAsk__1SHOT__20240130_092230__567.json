It has two fields: a value of any type that is a subtype of `Real` and a string representing the unit. Then, we implement the `show` method. This method takes an IO stream and an instance of our struct as parameters, and prints out the value followed by a space and then the unit.\n\nHere is how you might use this type:\n\n```julia\nfo = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fo) # prints 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,212],"elapsed":1.791518557,"_type":"aimessage"}]
