We then implement the `Base.show` function which is responsible for printing the object to the console. In the implementation of this function, we print the `value` field followed by a space and then the `unit` field.\n\nYou can create an instance of FloatWithUnits like so:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu) # prints 1.8 meters\n```\nThis will print \"1.8 meters\" to the console.","status":200,"tokens":[0,234],"elapsed":2.106125511,"_type":"aimessage"}]
