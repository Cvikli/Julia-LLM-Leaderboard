The `unit` is a string. The `show` method uses the IO stream `io` to print out the value and unit of the given FloatWithUnits object `x`.\n\nFor instance, if we create an object like this:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n```\nWe can use the `show` function with `fwu`:\n```julia\nprint(fwu)\n```\nAnd it would print out as:\n```\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,218],"elapsed":1.975876312,"_type":"aimessage"}]
