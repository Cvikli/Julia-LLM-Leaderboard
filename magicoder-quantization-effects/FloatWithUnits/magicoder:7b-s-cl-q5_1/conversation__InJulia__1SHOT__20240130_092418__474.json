We've defined a method for displaying (or \"showing\") these objects using the `Base.show` function. Inside our custom show method, we use Julia's built-in string interpolation (`\"$variable\"`) to print out both the value and the unit in the format \"value unit\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,169],"elapsed":1.510262577,"_type":"aimessage"}]
