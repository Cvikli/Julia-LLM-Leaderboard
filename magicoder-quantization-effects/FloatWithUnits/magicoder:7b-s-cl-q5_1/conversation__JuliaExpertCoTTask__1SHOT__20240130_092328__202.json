We then define a function that will be called when we want to print an instance of our struct. This function takes an IO object (which is used for writing data to) and the struct itself as parameters, and it simply prints the value and unit in the desired format. \n\nThis way, when you have a `FloatWithUnits` object and call `show` on it, it will display its value followed by a space and then its unit.","status":200,"tokens":[230,208],"elapsed":3.96545972,"_type":"aimessage"}]
