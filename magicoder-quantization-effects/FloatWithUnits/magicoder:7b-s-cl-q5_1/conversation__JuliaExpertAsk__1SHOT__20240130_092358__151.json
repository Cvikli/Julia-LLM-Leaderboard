This is because `println` adds a newline character at the end of the output, and since you're just concatenating two strings (the value and unit), it's unnecessary to add an extra newline. The `$(...)` syntax in the `print` function is used for string interpolation, where variables can be included inside the string by surrounding them with `$(...)`.\n\nHere's how you can use this:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # prints \"1.8 meters\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,224],"elapsed":2.018343915,"_type":"aimessage"}]
