Here's how you would define your `FloatWithUnits` struct and its `show` method:\n\n```julia\nmodule MyModule\nexport FloatWithUnits, show\n\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T} <: Real\n    value::T\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    write(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\nend\n\nend # module MyModule\n```\n\nNow you can use this `FloatWithUnits` type in the following way:\n\n```julia\nusing .MyModule\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(f)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```\n\nIn this example, we define a module `MyModule` where we define the `FloatWithUnits` struct and its `show` method. The `show` method uses the built-in `write` function to print out the string representation of our `FloatWithUnits` object. We use `$(...)` syntax for string interpolation, which replaces the expression inside the parentheses with its value in the context where it's being written into a larger string. The `show` method also uses `IO` type parameter that is provided by Julia's standard library to print out the representation of our `FloatWithUnits`.\n\nThe `.MyModule` part in `using .MyModule` tells Julia we want to use the module from the current working directory rather than a package in Pkg.","status":200,"tokens":[105,375],"elapsed":3.419218647,"_type":"aimessage"}]
