It uses the `print` function to print out a string representation of the FloatWithUnits object. The string is constructed by multiplying the value and unit together (as if they were numbers), then passing it to `print`, which writes the string into the IO stream you passed in (`io` in this case). \n\nFor example, suppose we have an instance of `FloatWithUnits`:\n```julia\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n```\nThen:\n```julia\nprintln(f) # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,216],"elapsed":1.950219094,"_type":"aimessage"}]
