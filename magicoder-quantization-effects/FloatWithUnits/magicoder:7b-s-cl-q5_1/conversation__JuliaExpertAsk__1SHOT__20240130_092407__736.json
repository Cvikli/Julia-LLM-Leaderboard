The `show` function is then implemented to format the output of an instance of `FloatWithUnits` according to our needs, in this case it concatenates the value and unit with a space.\n\nHere's how you could create an instance of `FloatWithUnits`:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # prints: 1.8 meters\n```\nThis will output the value and unit as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[0,217],"elapsed":1.961093521,"_type":"aimessage"}]
