Here's how you would do it for your case:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T}\n    value::T\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, x::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, x.value, \" \", x.unit)\nend\n```\nThis `show` function overloads the default `show` method for your specific type. This is a bit tricky because you have to define it inside of the struct definition itself since Julia does not support methods defined outside of types. \n\nIn this code:\n- `FloatWithUnits{T}` declares a new parameterized (generic) struct. The type parameter `T` can be any type but must be specified when creating an instance of this struct. For example, `FloatWithUnits(3.5, \"meters\")`.\n- Inside the `show` function:\n  - `io::IO` is the IO stream to which data will be printed\n  - `x::FloatWithUnits` specifies that we are working with an instance of our `FloatWithUnits` struct\n  - The `print` function writes output directly to the provided IO object (`io`). It takes two arguments: a string (`\" \"` in this case, which just adds a space between value and unit) and the FloatWithUnits instance (`x`)\n  \nNow if you want to print an instance of `FloatWithUnits`, like `fwu = FloatWithUnits(3.5, \"meters\")`, using the `show` function:\n```julia\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(3.5, \"meters\")\n3.5 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,401],"elapsed":3.641809814,"_type":"aimessage"}]
