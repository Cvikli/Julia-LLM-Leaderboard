Then, we write a method for `Base.show`, which is a built-in function in Julia for customizing how objects are printed to the console (i.e., what goes inside `print(io, ...)`).\n\nInside `Base.show`, we print the value of the object followed by a space and then the unit. The `$(...)` syntax is used for string interpolation, which is a way in Julia to embed expressions within a string using a syntax that looks just like an embedded expression. This allows us to easily include the values of our object's fields inside our string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,231],"elapsed":2.076670398,"_type":"aimessage"}]
