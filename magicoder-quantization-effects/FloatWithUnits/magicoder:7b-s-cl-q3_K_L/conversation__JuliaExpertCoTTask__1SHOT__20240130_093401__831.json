The show method concatenates the value and unit with a space and then print it to the provided IO stream. \n\nThe test at the end creates an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and prints it using `println`. You should see \"1.8 meters\" printed out, which is the formatted string representation of the `FloatWithUnits` object f.","status":200,"tokens":[0,240],"elapsed":1.947352946,"_type":"aimessage"}]
