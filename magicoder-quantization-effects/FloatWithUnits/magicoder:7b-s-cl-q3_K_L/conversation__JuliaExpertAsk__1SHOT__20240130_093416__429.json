When you call `print(FloatWithUnits)` on an instance `u` of FloatWithUnits, it will output `u.value` followed by a space and then `u.unit`.\n\nFor example:\n```julia\nx = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nshow(stdout, x) #prints 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,181],"elapsed":1.447643088,"_type":"aimessage"}]
