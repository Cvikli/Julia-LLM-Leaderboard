We then create a function `show` which will print the value and unit when called with an IO object and an instance of FloatWithUnits. In the end, we test our `FloatWithUnits` type by creating an instance and printing it to the console.","status":200,"tokens":[0,196],"elapsed":1.582809124,"_type":"aimessage"}]
