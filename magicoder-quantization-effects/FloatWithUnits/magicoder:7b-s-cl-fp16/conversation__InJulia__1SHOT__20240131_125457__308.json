The struct has two fields: `value` and `unit`, both of which are typed to be subtypes of the abstract type `Real`. \n\nThe `show` function is then defined to take an I/O stream (`io`) and a `FloatWithUnits` object (`f`). It prints out the value followed by a space and then the unit.","status":200,"tokens":[0,159],"elapsed":2.742987245,"_type":"aimessage"}]
