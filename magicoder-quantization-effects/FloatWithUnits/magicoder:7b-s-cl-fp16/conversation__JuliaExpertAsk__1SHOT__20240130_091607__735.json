Here is how you can achieve what you want:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T <: Real}\n    value::T\n    unit::String\nend\n\n# Show method implementation\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n   print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\nend\n```\n\nIn this case, we have created a `struct` named `FloatWithUnits`, which has two fields: `value` and `unit`. The `show` method is implemented to take an I/O stream (`io::IO`) and an object of type `FloatWithUnits` (`fwu::FloatWithUnits`). Inside the `show` function, we use string interpolation `$(...)` to print out the value and unit. \n\nFor example:\n```julia\na = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(a) # This will output: \"1.8 meters\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,248],"elapsed":4.325419878,"_type":"aimessage"}]
