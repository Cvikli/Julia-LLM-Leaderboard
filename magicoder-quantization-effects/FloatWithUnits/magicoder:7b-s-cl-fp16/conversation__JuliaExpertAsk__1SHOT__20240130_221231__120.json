Then we define a function `show` that takes an I/O stream (`io`) and a `FloatWithUnits` object (`fwu`). The function prints the value and unit of the `FloatWithUnits` object to the provided I/O stream.\n\nYou can then use this struct in your code like this:\n\n```julia\nx = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(x)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,231],"elapsed":3.978686917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
