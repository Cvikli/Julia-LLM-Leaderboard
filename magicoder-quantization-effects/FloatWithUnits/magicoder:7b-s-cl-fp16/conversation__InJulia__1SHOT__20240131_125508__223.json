It also defines a method for displaying an instance of `FloatWithUnits`. This method takes an IO stream and the `FloatWithUnits` object to display, and it prints the value and unit in the format \"value unit\".\n\nHere's how you can use this type:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # Outputs: \"1.8 meters\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,228],"elapsed":3.926185582,"_type":"aimessage"}]
