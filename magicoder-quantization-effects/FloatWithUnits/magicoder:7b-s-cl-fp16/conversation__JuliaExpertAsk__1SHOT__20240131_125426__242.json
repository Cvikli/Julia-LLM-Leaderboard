The `show` function takes an IO stream and a `FloatWithUnits` object as input, and it prints the value and unit of the `FloatWithUnits` object in the format \"value unit\".\n\nYou can use this struct like this:\n\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,221],"elapsed":3.814219649,"_type":"aimessage"}]
