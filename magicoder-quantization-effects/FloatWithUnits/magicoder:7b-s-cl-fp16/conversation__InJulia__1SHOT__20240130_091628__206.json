The `show` function is then defined to take an IO stream (`io`) and a value of the type `FloatWithUnits`, and it prints out the `value` followed by a space, followed by the `unit`. \n\nYou can test this with the following:\n```julia\nx = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(x) # Outputs: \"1.8 meters\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,198],"elapsed":3.451671546,"_type":"aimessage"}]
