This is a generic version of our struct, which means it can take any subtype of the Real number type (`Int64`, `Float64`, etc.).\n- The fields `value` and `unit` are defined within this struct.\n- `Base.show(io::IO, f::FloatWithUnits)` is a function that will be called when we print an instance of our struct. It takes two arguments: `io`, which is the output IO object (like stdout or stderr), and `f` which is the instance of our struct that we're trying to show.\n- The `print(io, \"$(f.value) $(f.unit)\")`, inside this function, will concatenate the value and unit with a space between them and print it out to the IO object.","status":200,"tokens":[105,306],"elapsed":5.300197507,"_type":"aimessage"}]
