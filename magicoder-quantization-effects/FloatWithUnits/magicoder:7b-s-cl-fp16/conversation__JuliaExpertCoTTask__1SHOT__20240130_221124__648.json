We then implement the show method for this type. The show method takes an IO object and an instance of FloatWithUnits as arguments. It prints the value and unit in the format \"value unit\".\n\nYou can use this `FloatWithUnits` struct like this:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[230,210],"elapsed":28.238610599,"_type":"aimessage"}]
