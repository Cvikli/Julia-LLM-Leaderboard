The type of the value is not specified but can be any numeric type (like Int, Float64 etc.)\n- Then we implement the `show` method for the FloatWithUnits. This function prints the `value` and `unit`, separated by a space, to the IO stream provided as an argument.\n\nNote: The above code assumes that you want to print the unit along with the value. If you want to display only the unit without the value, then you can modify the `show` method like this:\n```julia\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(fwu.unit)\")\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,260],"elapsed":4.503516943,"_type":"aimessage"}]
