It is assumed that `x.unit` represents the unit of measurement. The `Base.show` function is used to print out an object in a user-friendly way.\n\nPlease note, this method assumes you have defined appropriate multiplication and conversion functions for your `FloatWithUnits` type. These methods are not provided here because their implementation depends on how these conversions should be done.","status":200,"tokens":[0,229],"elapsed":4.010397923,"_type":"aimessage"}]
