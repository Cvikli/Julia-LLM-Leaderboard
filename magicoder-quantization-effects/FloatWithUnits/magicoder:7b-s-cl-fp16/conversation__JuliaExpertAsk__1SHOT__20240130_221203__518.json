We then implement a function `show` for this type that prints the value and unit in the desired format to an IO stream. The `$(fwu.value)` syntax is used to interpolate the value field of our FloatWithUnits object into the string, and the same goes for the unit field.","status":200,"tokens":[105,175],"elapsed":3.02087652,"_type":"aimessage"}]
