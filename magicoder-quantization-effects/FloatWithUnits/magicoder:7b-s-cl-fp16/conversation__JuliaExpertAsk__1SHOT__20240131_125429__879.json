We then write a `show` method for this struct. This `show` function concatenates the value and unit with a space and prints it to the given IO object.\n\nYou can use this struct like this:\n```julia\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(f)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,189],"elapsed":3.275305589,"_type":"aimessage"}]
