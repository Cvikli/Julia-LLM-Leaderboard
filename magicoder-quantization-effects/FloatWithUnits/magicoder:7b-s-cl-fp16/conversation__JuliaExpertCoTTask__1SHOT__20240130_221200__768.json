Then, we implement a function `show` that takes an I/O stream (`io`) and a `FloatWithUnits` object (`fwu`). Inside this function, we use `print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")`, which prints the value and unit of the `FloatWithUnits` object to the provided I/O stream.\n\nNow you can test it with your example:\n```julia\njulia> FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,231],"elapsed":3.992215174,"_type":"aimessage"}]
