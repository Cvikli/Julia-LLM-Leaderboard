The `show` function is then defined to take an IO stream (`io`) and a `FloatWithUnits` object (`fwu`). Inside the function, it uses string interpolation to print out the value and unit in the format \"value unit\".\n\nYou can test this with:\n```julia\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,201],"elapsed":3.462598396,"_type":"aimessage"}]
