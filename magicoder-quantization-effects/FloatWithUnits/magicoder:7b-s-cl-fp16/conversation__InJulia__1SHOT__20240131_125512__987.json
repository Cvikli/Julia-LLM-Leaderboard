The first argument `io::IO` is the stream where you want to write (print) the representation of your object, and the second argument `f::FloatWithUnits` is the object itself.\n\nIn this case, we are defining the method for displaying a FloatWithUnits instance `f`. We use string interpolation `$(...)` to print both the value and unit of the struct. The `print(io, ...)` function writes its arguments to the IO stream.","status":200,"tokens":[0,205],"elapsed":3.528679159,"_type":"aimessage"}]
