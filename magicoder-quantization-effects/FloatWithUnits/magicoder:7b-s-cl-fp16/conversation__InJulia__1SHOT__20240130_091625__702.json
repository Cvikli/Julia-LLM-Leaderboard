Then, we override the built-in `show` function for this type. The `Base.show` function is defined in Julia's Base module to customize how instances of different types are printed (represented as strings).\n\nIn our custom version of the `show` method, we print the value followed by a space and then the unit of measure. Note that it's critical for this approach to ensure the `unit` field is a string. If it were a different type, you would need to change how you format it into a string representation.","status":200,"tokens":[0,225],"elapsed":3.923917511,"_type":"aimessage"}]
