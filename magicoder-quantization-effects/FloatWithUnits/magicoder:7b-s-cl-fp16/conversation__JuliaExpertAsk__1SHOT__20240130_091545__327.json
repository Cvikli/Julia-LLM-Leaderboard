You would have something like this:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64  # The value of the measurement\n    unit::String   # The unit of the measurement\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, f::FloatWithUnits)\n    @printf(\"%.1f %s\", f.value, f.unit)\nend\n```\n\nHere, `%.1f` is a formatting string that specifies to print a floating point number with one decimal place, `%s` formats the `unit` field as a string. The `show` function's return type should be `Nothing`, hence we use `@printf` which prints directly to `io`.\n  \nNow if you create an instance of FloatWithUnits and print it:\n```julia\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(f)  # This will output: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,232],"elapsed":4.073585017,"_type":"aimessage"}]
