[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a struct `FloatWithUnits` with fields `value` and `unit` (make sure to define it!), write a `show` method for it that will concatenate the value and unit with a space like this \"1.8 meters\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might implement such a function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T<:Real}\n    value::T\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, u::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(u.value) $(u.unit)\")\nend\n```\nIn the above code `FloatWithUnits` is a struct that has two fields: `value` and `unit`. The `Base.show` function is used to provide a string representation of an object in Julia. In this case, it concatenates the value and unit with a space between them.\n\nThe special instructions would be added inside the function as follows:\n```julia\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, u::FloatWithUnits)\n    if some_condition  # replace with your condition\n        print(io, \"$(u.value) $(u.unit)\")\n    else\n        print(io, \"Some other representation\")\n    end\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[11,234],"elapsed":4.085683849,"_type":"aimessage"}]
