The first argument `io` is the output stream where the result should be printed. The second argument `fwu::FloatWithUnits` is the object for which we want to print something.\n\nInside this function, we use string interpolation `$(...)` to concatenate the value and unit with a space in between. This will display \"1.8 meters\" when you call `show(io, FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\"))`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,210],"elapsed":3.596139519,"_type":"aimessage"}]
