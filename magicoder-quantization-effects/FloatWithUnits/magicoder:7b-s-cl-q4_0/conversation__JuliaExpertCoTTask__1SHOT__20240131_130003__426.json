Here is how you would define `FloatWithUnits` in the question:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T <: Real}\n    value::T\n    unit::String\nend\n```\n\nThen, you can provide a method for the `show` function to print your struct in a specific format. Here is an example of how you might do it:\n\n```julia\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, f::FloatWithUnits)\n    println(io, \"$(f.value) $(f.unit)\")\nend\n```\nIn this case, `Base.show` is a built-in function in Julia that allows you to control how an object of a particular type is displayed when printed. The function takes two arguments - the IO stream (`io`) and the object itself (`f`). \n\nThe `println(io, \"$(f.value) $(f.unit)\")` part will print the value and unit of the FloatWithUnits instance in the format \"1.8 meters\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,239],"elapsed":1.810289796,"_type":"aimessage"}]
