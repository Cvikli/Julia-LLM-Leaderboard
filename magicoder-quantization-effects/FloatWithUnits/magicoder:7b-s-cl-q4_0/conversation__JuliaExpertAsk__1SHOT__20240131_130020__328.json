The `show` method is defined to output the value and unit in the format \"1.8 meters\". \n\nFor example, if you create an instance of `FloatWithUnits`, say `fwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")`, calling `show(stdout, fwu)` will print \"1.8 meters\" to the standard output.","status":200,"tokens":[0,199],"elapsed":1.485956397,"_type":"aimessage"}]
