Inside this function, we use the `print` function to output the value and unit of the `FloatWithUnits` instance in the format \"value unit\". \n\nYou can then create instances of `FloatWithUnits` like so:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu) # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,220],"elapsed":1.620833392,"_type":"aimessage"}]
