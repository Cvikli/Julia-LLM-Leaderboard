Then we implement a `show` function that prints the value and unit in the format \"value unit\". \n\nNote that this is very basic functionality. In practice, you would probably want to include more complex error checking (e.g., for ensuring that `fwu.value` is a number and not a string, etc.) as well as formatting options (such as using decimal places or commas in the value depending on the unit).","status":200,"tokens":[0,204],"elapsed":1.540660406,"_type":"aimessage"}]
