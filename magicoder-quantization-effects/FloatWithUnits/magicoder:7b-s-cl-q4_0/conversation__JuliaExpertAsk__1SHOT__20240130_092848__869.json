The `Base.show` function is responsible for displaying objects of this type. In the `show` method, we print the value first and then the unit separated by a space. This results in a string representation of your object that includes its value and units.","status":200,"tokens":[0,148],"elapsed":1.121468695,"_type":"aimessage"}]
