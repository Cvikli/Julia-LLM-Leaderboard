The `show` function is defined to take an IO stream (`io`) and a `FloatWithUnits` object (`fwu`), and it prints out the value and unit in the format \"value unit\".\n\nHere's how you can use this:\n\n```julia\njulia> f = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n\njulia> print(f)\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[105,253],"elapsed":1.893107828,"_type":"aimessage"}]
