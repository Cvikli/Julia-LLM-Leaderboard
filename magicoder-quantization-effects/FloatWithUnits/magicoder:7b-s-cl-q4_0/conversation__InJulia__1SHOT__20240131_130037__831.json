Here we are defining it for `FloatWithUnits`. It takes two arguments: the IO stream (which usually represents the console), and our struct `fwu::FloatWithUnits`. In the method body, we simply print out the value and unit of the struct separated by a space.","status":200,"tokens":[0,165],"elapsed":1.226865758,"_type":"aimessage"}]
