It prints the value and unit of the FloatWithUnits object. \n\nThe `FloatWithUnits{T <: Number}` line defines the struct with two fields, `value` and `unit`, where `T` is a type that extends `Number`. The `{...}` syntax after the struct name is used to specify the parameters of the struct.\n\nThis code will work for any number type (e.g., Float64, Int64), not just Float64 as in your example. If you want it to be specific to Float64, replace `T <: Number` with `Float64`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,256],"elapsed":1.903311791,"_type":"aimessage"}]
