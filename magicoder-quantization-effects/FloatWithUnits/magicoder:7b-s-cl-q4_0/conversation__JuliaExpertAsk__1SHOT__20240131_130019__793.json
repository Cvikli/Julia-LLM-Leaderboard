Here's how you would do it:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, u::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(u.value) $(u.unit)\")\nend\n```\n\nIn this code snippet, `Base.show` is a built-in function in Julia that controls how objects are printed to the console. The first argument `io` is an IO object that represents the output stream (the console), and `u` is an instance of your struct `FloatWithUnits`.\n\nThe `print(io, \"$(u.value) $(u.unit)\")` line will print out the value and unit of your struct in a formatted manner. The `$()` syntax is used for string interpolation in Julia which allows you to insert values into strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,212],"elapsed":1.586864894,"_type":"aimessage"}]
