This can be done by running `using Printf`. Then you would define your `show` function:\n\n```julia\nBase.show(io::IO, x::FloatWithUnits) = @printf(\"%g %s\", x.value, x.unit)\n```\nHere's how the show function works: `@printf` is a macro that prints a formatted string. The first argument is the format specifier, `\"%g\"` means \"print value as general number\", `x.value` gets the value from our struct, and `x.unit` is just text we want to print.\n\nThe function can now be used like this:\n\n```julia\na = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(a) # prints \"1.8 meters\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,244],"elapsed":1.89059971,"_type":"aimessage"}]
