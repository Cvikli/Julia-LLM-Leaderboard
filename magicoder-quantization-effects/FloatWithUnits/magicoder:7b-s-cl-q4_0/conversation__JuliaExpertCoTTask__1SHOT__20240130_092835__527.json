The function `Base.show` is a built-in function in Julia that is responsible for displaying an object to the user, usually in a REPL or notebook environment. In this case, it prints the string representation of the object to the provided IO (input/output) stream.\n\nIn our case, we take advantage of the fact that `*` can concatenate strings and use it to print the value, a space, and then the unit of the FloatWithUnits object.","status":200,"tokens":[0,225],"elapsed":1.73026015,"_type":"aimessage"}]
