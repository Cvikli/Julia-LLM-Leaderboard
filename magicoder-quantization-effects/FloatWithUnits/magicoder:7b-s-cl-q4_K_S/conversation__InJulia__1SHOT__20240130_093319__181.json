It's parameterized by the type of its first field, which is assumed to be a subtype of `Real`, so it can hold either integer or floating-point values. Then we define a method for `Base.show(io::IO, f::FloatWithUnits)`, which is called when you call `print` on an object of type `FloatWithUnits`.\n\nInside the `show` function, we print the value and unit of the `FloatWithUnits` instance to the IO stream (`io`) with a space in between.","status":200,"tokens":[0,214],"elapsed":1.685246597,"_type":"aimessage"}]
