Then it defines a function called `show` that takes an IO object `io` and a value `x` of type `FloatWithUnits`, where `io` is the output stream and `x` is the value to be printed. Inside this function, it prints out the value and unit with a space between them using `print(io, x.value, \" \", x.unit)`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,208],"elapsed":1.626879524,"_type":"aimessage"}]
