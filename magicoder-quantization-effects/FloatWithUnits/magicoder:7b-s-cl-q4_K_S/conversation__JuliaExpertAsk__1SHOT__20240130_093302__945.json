The `show` function takes in an IO stream (`io`) and a FloatWithUnits object (`fwu`). It prints out the value (converted to string) followed by a space, then it prints out the unit.\n\nYou can use this struct and show method like below:\n\n```julia\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,222],"elapsed":1.722147125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
