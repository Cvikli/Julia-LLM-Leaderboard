Whenever you use `println` or similar functions that print to the console, it will call this `show` method and format the output accordingly. The `io::IO` argument represents the \"input-output\" stream where the result of the function is written (usually the console). The second argument `x::FloatWithUnits` represents the instance of `FloatWithUnits` that you want to print out.","status":200,"tokens":[0,222],"elapsed":1.71473908,"_type":"aimessage"}]
