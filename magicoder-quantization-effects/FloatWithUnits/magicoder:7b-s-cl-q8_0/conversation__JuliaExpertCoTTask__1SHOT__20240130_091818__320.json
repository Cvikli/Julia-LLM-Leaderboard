The method `show` is then defined to print the value followed by space and the unit. We use the IOStream object `io` to output the string representation of `x.value`, followed by the string `\" \"`, followed by the string in `x.unit`. \n\nThis is one way to solve your problem, but keep in mind that you can also define a more complex struct if you need to store more information about the value and its unit (such as its dimensionality).","status":200,"tokens":[0,248],"elapsed":2.812494113,"_type":"aimessage"}]
