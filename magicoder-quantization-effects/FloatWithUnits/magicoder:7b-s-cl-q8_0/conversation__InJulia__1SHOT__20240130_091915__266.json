We then override the default behavior of the `show` function by defining it in terms of our `FloatWithUnits` struct.\n\nThe `Base.show(io::IO, f::FloatWithUnits)` method tells Julia how to print an object of type `FloatWithUnits` to the screen or other output device. In this case, we just print the value and unit separated by a space.","status":200,"tokens":[0,204],"elapsed":2.264179917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
