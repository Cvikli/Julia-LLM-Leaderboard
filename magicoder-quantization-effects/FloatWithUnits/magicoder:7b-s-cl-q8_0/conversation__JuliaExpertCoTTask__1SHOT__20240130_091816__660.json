Here's an example of how to define your `FloatWithUnits` type:\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n```\nThen, you can write a method for displaying this type:\n```julia\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, f::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(f.value) $(f.unit)\")\nend\n```\nHere, the `Base.show` function is overloaded to provide a custom string representation for instances of your `FloatWithUnits` type. The `print` function writes a string to the IO stream passed as first argument (`io`), followed by the value and unit fields of the `FloatWithUnits` instance (`f`).\n\nFinally, you can create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and print it:\n```julia\nx = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(x)  # prints: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,245],"elapsed":2.780551061,"_type":"aimessage"}]
