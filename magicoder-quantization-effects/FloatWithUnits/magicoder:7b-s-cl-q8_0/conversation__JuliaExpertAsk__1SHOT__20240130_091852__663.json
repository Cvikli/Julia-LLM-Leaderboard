We then define a method for the `show` function in the Base module. The `show` function is a built-in Julia function that is used to print representations of Julia objects.\n\nThe `Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)` line defines the show method for `FloatWithUnits`. When this method gets called with an IO stream and an instance of FloatWithUnits, it prints out the value and unit to the given stream (in our case, the standard output).\n\nThe `print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)` line does the actual printing. It uses the `print` function to write the string representation of the value, a space character, and then the unit.","status":200,"tokens":[0,276],"elapsed":3.076916182,"_type":"aimessage"}]
