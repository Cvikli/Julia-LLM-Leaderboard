Then we implement a method for `show` function from Base which is used to print the objects. The `Base.show` function takes an I/O stream as its first argument (`io::IO`) and the object it's printing (`fwu::FloatWithUnits`) as its second argument. \n\nWhen you call `print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")`, Julia will format `$(fwu.value)` to the value of `fwu.value` and `$(fwu.unit)` to the string in `fwu.unit`. The result is a formatted string that includes both the value and unit, separated by a space, which is then printed to `io`.\n\nNow when you create an instance of `FloatWithUnits`, it will print with its value and unit like this \"1.8 meters\":\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # Output: \"1.8 meters\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,348],"elapsed":3.953551223,"_type":"aimessage"}]
