The generic type parameter `T<:AbstractFloat` ensures that the `value` field can be of any numeric type that is a subtype of AbstractFloat. Then, we implement a `show` function for this struct. This function takes in an IO stream (`io::IO`) and a `FloatWithUnits` object (`fwu::FloatWithUnits`). Inside the function, it uses the `print` function to print the value and unit on the provided IO stream. The `$(...)`, inside the `print` call, is used for string interpolation which replaces variables in the string with their values.\n\nYou can use this struct like so:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nshow(stdout, fwu)  # prints: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,288],"elapsed":3.220043803,"_type":"aimessage"}]
