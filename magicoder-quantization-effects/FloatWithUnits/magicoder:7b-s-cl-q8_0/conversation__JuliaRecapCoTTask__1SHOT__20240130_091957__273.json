[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a struct `FloatWithUnits` with fields `value` and `unit` (make sure to define it!), write a `show` method for it that will concatenate the value and unit with a space like this \"1.8 meters\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T<:Number, U}\n    value::T\n    unit::U\nend\n\nBase.show(io::IO, x::FloatWithUnits) = print(io, \"$(x.value) $(x.unit)\")\n```\n\nThe `FloatWithUnits` struct is defined to take a generic Number type and another type for the units. The `show` function overrides the default behavior of printing an object by writing a custom string that includes the value and unit of the FloatWithUnits object. \n\nIn your special instructions, if you want to make sure that the show method is used correctly in your code, you can use `print(io, \"$(FloatWithUnits(18.5, \"meters\"))\")`. It will print: \"18.5 meters\" as desired.","status":200,"tokens":[0,189],"elapsed":2.140220419,"_type":"aimessage"}]
