Here is an example of how you might implement it:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n   print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\nend\n```\n\nIn this example, we define a struct `FloatWithUnits` with two fields: `value` and `unit`. Then, we use the built-in function `Base.show()` to define how an instance of `FloatWithUnits` is printed out. The `print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)` line will print the value and unit of the FloatWithUnits object in the format you described.","status":200,"tokens":[0,198],"elapsed":2.205663055,"_type":"aimessage"}]
