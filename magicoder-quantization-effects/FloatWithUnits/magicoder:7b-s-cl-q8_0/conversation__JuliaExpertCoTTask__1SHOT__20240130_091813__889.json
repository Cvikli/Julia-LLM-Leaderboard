Then, we implement the `show` function for `FloatWithUnits`. In this function, we use string interpolation (`\"$(f.value) $(f.unit)\"`) to print out the value and unit in a formatted string.\n\nAfter defining these things, you can test them with `a = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")`, and then call `println` on `a`. It will output: 1.8 meters.","status":200,"tokens":[230,244],"elapsed":5.170216342,"_type":"aimessage"}]
