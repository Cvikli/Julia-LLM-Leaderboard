Here is how to implement it:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits <: Real  # Define a new type FloatWithUnits that extends Real\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\n# define show method for FloatWithUnits\nBase.show(io::IO, f::FloatWithUnits) = print(io, \"$(f.value) $(f.unit)\")\n```\nIn the above code `struct FloatWithUnits <: Real` indicates that this new struct `FloatWithUnits` is extending the built-in type `Real`. The `Base.show()` function is a built-in function in Julia which is responsible for displaying the contents of an object to an IO stream.\n\nThen, we define our own version of `show()` method by supplying it with two parameters: `io::IO` (the IO stream on which to print) and `f::FloatWithUnits` (the FloatWithUnits instance that needs to be displayed). We use string interpolation `$(f.value)` and `$(f.unit)` to print the value and unit of our struct, separated by a space.\n\nThis will now print \"1.8 meters\" for an object `x = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,312],"elapsed":3.475334559,"_type":"aimessage"}]
