Here's how to do it:\n\n```julia\nmodule MyModule\n\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\nend\n\nend # module MyModule\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- `module MyModule` is used to define a new module where the struct and show method will be defined.\n- `struct FloatWithUnits` defines a new type called `FloatWithUnits`. It has two fields, `value::Float64` and `unit::String`.\n- `function show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)` is the function that will be used to print the struct. The first argument `io::IO` is a stream where the output should be written (usually this would be `stdout`), and the second argument `fwu::FloatWithUnits` is an instance of the struct that we want to print.\n- Inside the function, `print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)` prints the value and unit of the struct. The string `\" \"` between `fwu.value` and `fwu.unit` is a space character.","status":200,"tokens":[0,326],"elapsed":2.713993365,"_type":"aimessage"}]
