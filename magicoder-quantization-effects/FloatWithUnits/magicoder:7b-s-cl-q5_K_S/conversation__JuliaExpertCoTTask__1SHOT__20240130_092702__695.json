The function `Base.show` is overloaded for this type of struct where it takes an I/O stream (`io::IO`) and the value to be printed (`x::FloatWithUnits`). Inside the function, we simply print the value followed by a space and then the unit.\n\nFinally, we create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` with `1.8` as the value and \"meters\" as the unit, and call `show` on it to display its string representation.","status":200,"tokens":[0,231],"elapsed":1.990102353,"_type":"aimessage"}]
