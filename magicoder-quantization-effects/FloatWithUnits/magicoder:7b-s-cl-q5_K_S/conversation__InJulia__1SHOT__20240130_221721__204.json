We then write a method for the `show` function that takes an IO stream (`io`) and a `FloatWithUnits` object (`fwu`). Inside this method, we use the built-in `print` function to print the value and unit of the `FloatWithUnits` object. The string inside the `print` function is formatted such that it includes a space between the value and the unit.","status":200,"tokens":[0,194],"elapsed":1.608166899,"_type":"aimessage"}]
