The `Base.show` function is defined to take an IO stream (the output in which the object will be printed), an instance of `FloatWithUnits`, and print the value and unit of the instance.\n\nYou can now create instances of `FloatWithUnits` and print them:\n```julia\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(f)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,216],"elapsed":1.801791215,"_type":"aimessage"}]
