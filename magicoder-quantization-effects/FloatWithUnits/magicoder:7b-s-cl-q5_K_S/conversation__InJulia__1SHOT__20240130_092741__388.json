Then it writes an `show` function for this struct which takes two arguments: an IO stream (to which the output is written) and an instance of FloatWithUnits. Inside the function, it uses the `print` method to write both the value and the unit into the provided IO stream.\n\nYou can use your new type like this:\n```julia\na = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(a)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,210],"elapsed":1.790785054,"_type":"aimessage"}]
