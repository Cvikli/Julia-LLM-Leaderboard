It then writes an implementation of the `show` function that will print out values in the desired format. Finally, it tests this approach by creating an instance of `FloatWithUnits` with a `value` of 1.8 and a `unit` of \"meters\", and prints this to the console. The output should be:\n```\n\"1.8 meters\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,200],"elapsed":1.721150847,"_type":"aimessage"}]
