The `Base.show` function is used to customize the printing of `FloatWithUnits` objects. When called with an IO stream and an instance of `FloatWithUnits`, it will print out the value and unit separated by a space.\n\nFor example, if you have an object `wu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")`, calling `show(stdout, wu)` would output: `1.8 meters` to stdout.","status":200,"tokens":[0,217],"elapsed":1.884494264,"_type":"aimessage"}]
