Here we are defining this method for `FloatWithUnits` struct so it can display value and unit in the format \"value unit\".\n\nYou can then use your new type like this:\n```julia\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(f)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,186],"elapsed":1.569347097,"_type":"aimessage"}]
