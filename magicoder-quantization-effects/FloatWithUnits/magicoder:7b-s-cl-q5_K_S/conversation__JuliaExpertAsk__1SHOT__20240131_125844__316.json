Then we implement the `show` function that will be called when you use `print` or `println` on an instance of `FloatWithUnits`.\n\nThe `Base.show` method is a built-in Julia function that defines how instances of a particular type should be printed to the console. The first argument `io::IO` specifies the output stream (usually the standard output, but could also be a file or any other IO device), and `fwu::FloatWithUnits` is the instance of the struct that we want to print.\n\nInside the function, we use string interpolation `$(...)` to format our output string. The fields `value` and `unit` are accessed using dot notation `.`. Finally, `print(io, ...)` writes the formatted string to the specified IO device.","status":200,"tokens":[0,287],"elapsed":2.432323942,"_type":"aimessage"}]
