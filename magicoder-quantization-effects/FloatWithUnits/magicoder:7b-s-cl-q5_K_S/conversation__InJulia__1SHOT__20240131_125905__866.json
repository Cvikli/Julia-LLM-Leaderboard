Here is how you can do it:\n\n```julia\n# Define FloatWithUnits struct\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T<:AbstractFloat}\n    value::T\n    unit::String\nend\n\n# Define show method\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\nend\n```\nIn the above code:\n- `struct FloatWithUnits{T<:AbstractFloat}` defines a struct that takes an AbstractFloat as its first type parameter (`T`).\n- `function Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)` is the function to be defined for showing `FloatWithUnits` object. It will take two arguments - `io` (the IO stream where the output should go) and `fwu` (an instance of FloatWithUnits).\n- Inside this function, we use `print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")`, which is a string interpolation that will print the value and unit of the `FloatWithUnits` object. The dollar signs (`$`) around the expression are required to prevent Julia from trying to evaluate the parts as variables or functions.","status":200,"tokens":[0,309],"elapsed":2.609045345,"_type":"aimessage"}]
