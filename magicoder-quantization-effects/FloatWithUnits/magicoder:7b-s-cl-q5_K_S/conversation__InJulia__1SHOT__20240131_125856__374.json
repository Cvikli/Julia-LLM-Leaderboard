The first argument `io` is an instance of IO (Input/Output) which represents the console or file. The second argument `fwu::FloatWithUnits` is an object of type FloatWithUnits.\n\nInside the method, we use string interpolation (`\"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\"`) to format and print the value and unit of our FloatWithUnits object. The `$` before `fwu.value` and `fwu.unit` is used for string interpolation in Julia.\n\nThis means that when you call `show(stdout, myFloatWithUnit)`, it will output \"1.8 meters\" to the console, assuming `myFloatWithUnit` is an instance of FloatWithUnits with a value of 1.8 and unit as \"meters\".","status":200,"tokens":[74,287],"elapsed":2.459672841,"_type":"aimessage"}]
