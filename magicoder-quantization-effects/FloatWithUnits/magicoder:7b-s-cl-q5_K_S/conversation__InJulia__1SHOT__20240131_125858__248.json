We also define a function `show` that will be called when printing an instance of our struct to the console. The function takes in two arguments: `io`, which is the IO stream (console output) where the print should go, and `fwu::FloatWithUnits`, which is the actual object we want to display.\n\nInside this function, we use `print` to send a string `\"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\"` to `io`. The `$(fwu.value)` syntax is used for string interpolation, which allows us to include the value of `fwu.value` in our output string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,247],"elapsed":2.083757362,"_type":"aimessage"}]
