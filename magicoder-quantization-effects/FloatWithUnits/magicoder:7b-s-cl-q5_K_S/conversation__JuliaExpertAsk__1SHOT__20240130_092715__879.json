We also define a `show` method for this struct that takes an I/O stream (`io::IO`) and an object of type `FloatWithUnits`.\n\nThis `show` function concatenates the value and unit with a space and then prints it to the provided I/O stream. The string interpolation `$(u.value) $(u.unit)` is used for this purpose, which will evaluate and print both `u.value` (the value field of the FloatWithUnits object) and `u.unit` (the unit field).\n\nNote that you might also want to implement a conversion function if you need to handle different units.","status":200,"tokens":[0,232],"elapsed":1.997347155,"_type":"aimessage"}]
