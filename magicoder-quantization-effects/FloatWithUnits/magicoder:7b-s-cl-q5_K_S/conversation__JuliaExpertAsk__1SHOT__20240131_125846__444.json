We then implement the `show` function to print out the value and unit in the format you specified. The `Base.show` function is part of Julia's pretty-printing system, which automatically calls this method when printing an instance of your struct.\n\nFor example:\n```julia\nx = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(x)  # Output: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,203],"elapsed":1.712815446,"_type":"aimessage"}]
