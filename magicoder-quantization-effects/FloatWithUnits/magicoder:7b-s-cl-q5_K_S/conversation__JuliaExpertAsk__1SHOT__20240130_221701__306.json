The `Base.show` function is used to define how the struct will be printed when called with `print`. It takes two arguments: an IO object and an instance of the struct (`fwu::FloatWithUnits`). Inside this method, we use string interpolation `$(...)` to print both the value and unit fields of the struct.","status":200,"tokens":[0,196],"elapsed":1.634421754,"_type":"aimessage"}]
