The `print` statement writes the value followed by the unit to the IO stream, which is typically the console in this case.\n\nNow you can use it like this:\n\n```julia\nx = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(x)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,217],"elapsed":1.883850187,"_type":"aimessage"}]
