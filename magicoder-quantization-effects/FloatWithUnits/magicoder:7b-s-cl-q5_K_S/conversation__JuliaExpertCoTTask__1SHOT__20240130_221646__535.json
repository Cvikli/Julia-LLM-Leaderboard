The type of the value is parameterized by `T`, which can be any type (e.g., Float64, Int64).\n- Then we implement a function `Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)` that will print the value and unit in the format \"value unit\". Here `io` is an IO object representing the output stream, `fwu` is an instance of `FloatWithUnits`.\n- Note: The `Base` module provides methods for basic operations on types. In this case, we're overloading the `show` method to provide a custom string representation for our type.","status":200,"tokens":[0,249],"elapsed":2.094175726,"_type":"aimessage"}]
