[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

The `Base.show` function is then defined as an overload of the built-in `show` function in Julia. This allows us to customize how instances of our type are printed, specifically by printing the value and unit separated by a space.","status":200,"tokens":[230,244],"elapsed":3.783577931,"_type":"aimessage"}]
