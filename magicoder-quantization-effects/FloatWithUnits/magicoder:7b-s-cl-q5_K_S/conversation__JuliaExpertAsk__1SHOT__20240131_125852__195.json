It takes two arguments: `io`, which is the output stream (usually the console), and `fwu`, which is the object you want to print. \n\nThe `print` function writes the string representation of its arguments, without adding any extra whitespace or newline characters. So we just need to pass in `fwu.value`, a space, and `fwu.unit`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,193],"elapsed":1.62886534,"_type":"aimessage"}]
