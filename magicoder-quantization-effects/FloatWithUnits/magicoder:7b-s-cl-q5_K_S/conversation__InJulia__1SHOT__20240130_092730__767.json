Then it writes the `show` method for this struct that takes an IO object and a FloatWithUnits object, and prints out the string representation of the value followed by a space and then the unit. The `string` function is used to convert the value to a string for printing.","status":200,"tokens":[0,180],"elapsed":1.539104478,"_type":"aimessage"}]
