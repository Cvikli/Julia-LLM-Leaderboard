In this case, we're defining the show method for our FloatWithUnits type to include both the value and unit. The `$(f.value)` part of the string concatenation uses a feature of strings in Julia where variables can be interpolated into them. \n\nThe test at the end creates an instance of `FloatWithUnits` with a value of 1.8 and a unit of \"meters\", then prints this to confirm it works as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[0,250],"elapsed":2.164256433,"_type":"aimessage"}]
