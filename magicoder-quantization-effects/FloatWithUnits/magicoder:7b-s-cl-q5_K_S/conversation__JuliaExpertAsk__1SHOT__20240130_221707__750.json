The function takes two parameters: \n    - `io::IO`: It's a stream that Julia uses for IO operations (like printing).\n    - `f::FloatWithUnits`: The object we want to print.\n- `print(io, \"$(f.value) $(f.unit)\")`: This line prints the value and unit of the FloatWithUnits object. It uses string interpolation (`$`) to insert the values of `f.value` and `f.unit` into a string. The space between them is automatically added by Julia's printing system.","status":200,"tokens":[0,285],"elapsed":2.379806898,"_type":"aimessage"}]
