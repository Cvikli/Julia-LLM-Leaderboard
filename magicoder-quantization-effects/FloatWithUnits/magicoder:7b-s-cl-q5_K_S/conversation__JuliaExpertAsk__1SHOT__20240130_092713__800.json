It then prints the value and unit of the FloatWithUnits instance to the provided IO stream. The values are formatted using the `$(...)`, which is a special syntax in Julia that interpolates variable values into strings.\n\nYou can use it like this:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,194],"elapsed":1.655640688,"_type":"aimessage"}]
