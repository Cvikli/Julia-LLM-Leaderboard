Then, we implement the `show` function for this struct. This function takes an IO stream (io::IO) and a FloatWithUnits object (fwu::FloatWithUnits) as arguments. Inside the function, we use the built-in print function to output the value and unit of the FloatWithUnits object.\n\nYou can test it with:\n```julia\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,224],"elapsed":1.879220495,"_type":"aimessage"}]
