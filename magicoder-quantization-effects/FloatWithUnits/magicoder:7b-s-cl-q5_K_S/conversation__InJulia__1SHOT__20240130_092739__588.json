Here's an example of how you can do it in Julia:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T}\n    value::T\n    unit::String\nend\n```\n\nNow we need to write the `show` method for our struct. The `show` function is a built-in function that's responsible for printing the object in the REPL. We can define it as follows:\n\n```julia\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, u::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, u.value, \" \", u.unit)\nend\n```\nIn this code snippet, we're defining a function `Base.show` which takes two arguments: the IO object where to print (usually STDOUT or some file), and an instance of our struct FloatWithUnits (`u`). This function will print out the value and unit in the desired format.\n\nHere is how you would create an instance of `FloatWithUnits`:\n\n```julia\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n```\nWhen you call `show(io, f)` (where `io` could be any IO object like `STDOUT`), it will print: `1.8 meters`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,309],"elapsed":2.663825382,"_type":"aimessage"}]
