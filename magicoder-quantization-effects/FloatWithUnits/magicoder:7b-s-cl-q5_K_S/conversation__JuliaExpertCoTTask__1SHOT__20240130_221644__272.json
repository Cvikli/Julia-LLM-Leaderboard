We then define a function `show` that will be used to print instances of our struct. Inside the `show` method, we use `print` to output the value and unit in the desired format.\n\nLet's test this with your example:\n\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # Output: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,207],"elapsed":1.736967256,"_type":"aimessage"}]
