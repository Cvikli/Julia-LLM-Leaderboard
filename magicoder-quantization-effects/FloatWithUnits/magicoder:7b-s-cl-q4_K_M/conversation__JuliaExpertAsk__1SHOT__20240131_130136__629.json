The `show` function prints the value and unit to an IO stream, just like the built-in `print` function.\n\nYou could then create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and print it:\n\n```julia\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(f)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[105,227],"elapsed":1.838322715,"_type":"aimessage"}]
