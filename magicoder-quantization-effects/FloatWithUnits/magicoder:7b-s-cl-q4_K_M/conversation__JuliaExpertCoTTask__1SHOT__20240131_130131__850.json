Inside this struct, we have two fields: `value` and `unit`. We then define a function called `Base.show` that takes an IO stream (`io`) and a `FloatWithUnits` object (`fwu`).\n\nInside the function, we print out the value first followed by a space using `print(io, fwu.value * \" \")`, then we print the unit with `print(io, fwu.unit)`. This will give us the output in the format of \"1.8 meters\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,222],"elapsed":1.771047011,"_type":"aimessage"}]
