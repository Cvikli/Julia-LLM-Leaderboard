We define a struct `FloatWithUnits` that takes in an AbstractFloat (which is a type that can be used like a floating point number). It also has a field for a string unit. \n2. Then, we implement the `show` function. This method prints out the value and unit of the FloatWithUnits object to a IO stream using the print macro. The syntax `$(fwu.value)` is used to insert the value into the string, followed by a space and then the unit.","status":200,"tokens":[0,197],"elapsed":1.580170788,"_type":"aimessage"}]
