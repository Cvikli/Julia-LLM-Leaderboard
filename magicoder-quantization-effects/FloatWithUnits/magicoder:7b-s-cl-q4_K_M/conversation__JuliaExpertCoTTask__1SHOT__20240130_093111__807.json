Here's an example:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T <: AbstractFloat}\n    value::T\n    unit::String\nend\n\nBase.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits) = print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\n```\nIn the `show` function above, we're printing out the value and the unit, separated by a space. We use `$(...)` for string interpolation to put the values of `fwu.value` and `fwu.unit` in their correct places. The type parameter `<: AbstractFloat` constrains `T` so that it can only be a subtype of `AbstractFloat`, which is the abstract type for floating-point numbers in Julia.\n\nYou could then test this with your example like so:\n\n```julia\njulia> f = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[230,247],"elapsed":3.561497529,"_type":"aimessage"}]
