We then define a function `Base.show` that takes an IO stream (which is the output of your program), a FloatWithUnits object (`fwu`), and prints out the value and unit in the format specified.\n\nYou can create an instance of this struct like so:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n```\nAnd then print it to the console with `println(fwu)`. The output should be: \"1.8 meters\".","status":200,"tokens":[230,218],"elapsed":6.303814158,"_type":"aimessage"}]
