The first argument (`io`) specifies the output stream (usually the console), and `fwu::FloatWithUnits` specifies that we are showing an instance of our custom FloatWithUnits type.\n\nInside the function, we use string interpolation `$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)` to print out the value and unit in a single string. The space between them is automatically inserted by Julia's string concatenation operator `*`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,217],"elapsed":1.698592926,"_type":"aimessage"}]
