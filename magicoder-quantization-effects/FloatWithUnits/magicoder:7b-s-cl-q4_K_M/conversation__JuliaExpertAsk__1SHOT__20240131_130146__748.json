The `show` function is defined for IO stream (`io::IO`) and the object to print (`u::FloatWithUnits`).\n\nNow, if you create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` like this:\n```julia\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n```\nAnd then call `show`, it will output:\n```julia\nprintln(f)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,244],"elapsed":1.937666686,"_type":"aimessage"}]
