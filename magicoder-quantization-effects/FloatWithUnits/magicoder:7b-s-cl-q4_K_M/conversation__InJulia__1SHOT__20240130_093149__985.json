We also define a method for `show`, which will output the value and unit in the format you described. \n\nThe `Base.show` function is one of Julia's built-in methods, so we don't need to import anything. The second parameter (`io::IO`) stands for \"input/output\", it's used to print on the screen or to a file if you use `IOContext(open(\"file.txt\"), :color=>true)`.\n\nThe `x::FloatWithUnits` is the instance of `FloatWithUnits`, and `print(io, x.value, \" \", x.unit)` just prints out the value and unit, separated by a space.","status":200,"tokens":[0,253],"elapsed":2.037573596,"_type":"aimessage"}]
