[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a struct `FloatWithUnits` with fields `value` and `unit` (make sure to define it!), write a `show` method for it that will concatenate the value and unit with a space like this \"1.8 meters\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could implement such a `show` function:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T<:Real} <: Real\n    value::T\n    unit::String\nend\n\nBase.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits) = print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\n```\n\nIn this code `Base.show` is a function that's responsible for printing instances of a type. It takes two arguments: the IO stream where it should write its output and an instance of the struct or class it's being called on (in this case, an instance of `FloatWithUnits`).\n\nThe `@code_warntype` macro can be used to check that your code is correct and efficient. Here we will see that all variables are inferred correctly by Julia:\n```julia\n@code_warntype Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits) = print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\n```\nNote that `Base.show` is implicitly defined and hence cannot be overridden directly. Instead, we could define a custom function and use `print`, or return a string and then print it in the calling code:\n\n```julia\nfunction show_with_units(fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    s = \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\"\n    print(s)\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,337],"elapsed":2.792001459,"_type":"aimessage"}]
