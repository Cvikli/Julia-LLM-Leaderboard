The first argument `io::IO` refers to the IO stream (usually the standard output, but it could be a file or other form of I/O) on which to print the representation of the value, and `u::FloatWithUnits` is the object you want to display.\n\nThe string `\"$($(u.value)) $($(u.unit))\"` will be printed as per the requirement in the question.","status":200,"tokens":[0,235],"elapsed":1.888553262,"_type":"aimessage"}]
