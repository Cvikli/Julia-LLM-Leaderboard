It then prints the value of `fwu`, followed by a space, and finally the unit. This implementation assumes that `value` and `unit` are both fields of type `T<:Real`. If they aren't, you will need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,178],"elapsed":1.408626201,"_type":"aimessage"}]
