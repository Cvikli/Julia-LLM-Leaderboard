It takes two arguments: one for the IO stream and one for your custom struct (`fwu::FloatWithUnits`). Inside this function, you simply concatenate `fwu.value` (the value of your struct) with `\" \"` (a space) and `fwu.unit` (the unit of your struct) using Julia's built-in print function `print`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,233],"elapsed":1.868818843,"_type":"aimessage"}]
