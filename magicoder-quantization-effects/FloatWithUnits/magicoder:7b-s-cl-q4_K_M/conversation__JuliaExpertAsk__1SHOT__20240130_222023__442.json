The function takes two arguments: `io`, which is an I/O stream (like stdout or stderr), and `fwu::FloatWithUnits`, which is the object you want to print.\n\nThe `print` function writes a string to the specified IO stream, so we use it to write our formatted string \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\" to the output.\n\nYou can now test this code:\n```julia\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,247],"elapsed":1.935450222,"_type":"aimessage"}]
