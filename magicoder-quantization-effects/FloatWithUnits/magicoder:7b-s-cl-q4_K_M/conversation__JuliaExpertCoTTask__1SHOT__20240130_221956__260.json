We then implement the `show` function for this type. This function takes in an IO stream (which is used to print the output) and a `FloatWithUnits` object. It prints out the value followed by a space, and then the unit.\n\nYou can test this code with:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,215],"elapsed":1.694223506,"_type":"aimessage"}]
