The first argument is the IO stream where you want to write your output (usually the console), and the second argument is the object you want to show.\n\nThe `FloatWithUnits{T}` struct takes a generic type `T` as its value field, and `String` for the unit field. The `show` function concatenates the value and unit with a space.\n\nYou can then test this by creating an instance of `FloatWithUnits`, like so:\n```julia\nx = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(x)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,240],"elapsed":1.899382119,"_type":"aimessage"}]
