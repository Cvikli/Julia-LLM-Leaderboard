The `<: Real` constraint ensures that our struct can only hold real numbers (like Float64 or Float32). The `print(io, u.value, \" \", u.unit)` line is responsible for actually printing the value and unit to the IO stream.\n\nHere's how you would use it:\n\n```julia\njulia> x = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,210],"elapsed":1.684181202,"_type":"aimessage"}]
