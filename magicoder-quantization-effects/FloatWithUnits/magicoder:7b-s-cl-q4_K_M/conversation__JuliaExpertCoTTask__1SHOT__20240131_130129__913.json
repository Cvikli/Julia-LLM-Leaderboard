We then override the built-in `show` function in Julia to customize how instances of our struct are displayed. The `print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")` expression inside the `Base.show` method concatenates the value and unit with a space between them.\n\nYou can now use your `FloatWithUnits` type in the REPL like this:\n\n```julia\njulia> f = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\");\n\njulia> show(f)\n\"1.8 meters\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,237],"elapsed":1.890962154,"_type":"aimessage"}]
