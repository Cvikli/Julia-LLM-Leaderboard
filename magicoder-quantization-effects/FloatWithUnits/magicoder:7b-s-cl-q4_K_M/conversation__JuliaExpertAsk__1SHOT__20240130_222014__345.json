We then implement the `show` function for `FloatWithUnits` objects. This function takes an IO object (which is used to print the output) and a `FloatWithUnits` object as arguments. Inside the function, we use string interpolation `$(fwu.value)` and `$(fwu.unit)` to insert the value and unit into the string that we're printing to the IO object.","status":200,"tokens":[0,193],"elapsed":1.50048979,"_type":"aimessage"}]
