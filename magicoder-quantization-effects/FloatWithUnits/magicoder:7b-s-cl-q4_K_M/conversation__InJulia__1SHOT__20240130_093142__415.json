We then define a `show` function that uses in-built Julia functionality to print out the value of the float followed by a space and the unit. Note that there are no parentheses around the `$(u.value)` expression - this is because we want to include the value without any extra whitespace or characters, and the `$` character is used for string interpolation in Julia.\n\nThis will make your struct print out as \"1.8 meters\" when you call `show`, with a space between the value and unit. You can replace \"meters\" with whatever unit you want to use.","status":200,"tokens":[74,226],"elapsed":1.834637347,"_type":"aimessage"}]
