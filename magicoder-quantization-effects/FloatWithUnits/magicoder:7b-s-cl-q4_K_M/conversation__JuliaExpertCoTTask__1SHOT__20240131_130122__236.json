Then we use Julia's built-in function `Base.show` to customize how instances of this type are printed. This function takes an I/O stream (like STDOUT) and the instance it is printing, and it should print a string representation of the instance.\n\nIn our implementation, we simply print out the value followed by a space and then the unit. The `T <: Real` constraint in the struct definition ensures that `value` can be any real number (like `Float64`, `Float32`, etc.).\n\nNow when you run this code, it will print something like \"1.8 meters\" for a FloatWithUnits instance with value 1.8 and unit \"meters\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,269],"elapsed":2.152763534,"_type":"aimessage"}]
