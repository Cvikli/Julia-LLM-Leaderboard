It takes two arguments: `io`, which should be the IO stream where you want to print (like `STDOUT`), and `fwu`, which should be your FloatWithUnits struct instance.\n\nYou could then use it like this:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # Outputs \"1.8 meters\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,220],"elapsed":1.634851614,"_type":"aimessage"}]
