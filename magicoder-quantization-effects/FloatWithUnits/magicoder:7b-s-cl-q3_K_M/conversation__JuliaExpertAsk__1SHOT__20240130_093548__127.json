The `show` function for `FloatWithUnits` concatenates the value and unit with a space. This will print \"1.8\" and \"Meter\" when you call `show(stdout, FloatWithUnits(1.8, Meter()))`.\n\nPlease remember that the output of this code might vary depending on your actual struct definition and its intended usage.","status":200,"tokens":[0,301],"elapsed":2.311888779,"_type":"aimessage"}]
