We override this method for FloatWithUnits by defining our own show function. The `IO` argument is just the output stream where you're writing to, and `w` is the FloatWithUnits instance that you want to display.\n\nYou can now create an instance of FloatWithUnits like:\n```julia\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(f)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[105,238],"elapsed":1.869008192,"_type":"aimessage"}]
