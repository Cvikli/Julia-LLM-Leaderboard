This will be the function that is called when you want to print an instance of our struct:\n\n```julia\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\nend\n```\nIn this `show` method function, `io` is the output stream, and `fwu` is an instance of our struct. We simply print out the value and unit separated by a space using the `print` function. \n\nThis way, when you call `println(myFloatWithUnit)`, it will print \"1.8 meters\", where `1.8` is the value and `meters` is the unit.","status":200,"tokens":[0,232],"elapsed":1.771752528,"_type":"aimessage"}]
