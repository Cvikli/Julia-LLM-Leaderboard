The method takes in an IO stream (`io::IO`) and a FloatWithUnits object (`x::FloatWithUnits`), which is then printed with a space between the value and unit.\n\nNow let's test it:\n```julia\njulia>FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,229],"elapsed":1.800568305,"_type":"aimessage"}]
