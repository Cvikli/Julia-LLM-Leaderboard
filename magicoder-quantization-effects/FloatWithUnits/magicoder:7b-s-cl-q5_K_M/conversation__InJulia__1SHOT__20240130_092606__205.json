Here is how you could do it:\n\n```julia\n# Define FloatWithUnits struct\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T}\n    value::T\n    unit::String\nend\n\n# Define show method\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\nend\n```\n\nThis `Base.show` function is a special Julia method that prints an object to the console in a human-readable format. In this case, it takes an IO stream (which can be any kind of file or console), and a FloatWithUnits instance as arguments. It then prints the value and unit of the struct.\n\nNote: If you're using a more complex unit system and need to parse/format units correctly, consider using the Unitful package in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[0,213],"elapsed":1.886734827,"_type":"aimessage"}]
