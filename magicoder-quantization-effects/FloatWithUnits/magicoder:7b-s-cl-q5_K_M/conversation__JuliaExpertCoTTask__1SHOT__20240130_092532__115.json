This function takes an I/O stream (i.e., the output console or file) and a `FloatWithUnits` object as arguments, then prints to the stream the value and unit of the object.\n\nFinally, you can use this struct and its show method like this:\n\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,303],"elapsed":2.721305108,"_type":"aimessage"}]
