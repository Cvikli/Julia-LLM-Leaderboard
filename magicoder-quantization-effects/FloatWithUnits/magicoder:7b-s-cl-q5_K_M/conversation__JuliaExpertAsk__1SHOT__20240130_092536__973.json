It takes two parameters - an IO stream (`io`) and the object it should display(`fwu::FloatWithUnits`). Inside this function, you can use `print` or `println` (which includes newline) functions to print to the `io` stream.\n\n`$(fwu.value)` is a string interpolation which will convert value into string using its `String` method. And `$(fwu.unit)` similarly converts unit string.","status":200,"tokens":[105,203],"elapsed":1.797786395,"_type":"aimessage"}]
