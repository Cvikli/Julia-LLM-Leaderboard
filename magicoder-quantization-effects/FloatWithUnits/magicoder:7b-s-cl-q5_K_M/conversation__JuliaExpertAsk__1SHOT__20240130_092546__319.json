This allows the value to be any numeric type (like Float64, Int32, etc.). The `unit::String` field holds the unit of the measurement. \n\nThen we implement the `Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)` function that accepts an IO stream and a `FloatWithUnits` instance as arguments. Inside this method, we call the built-in `print` function to print both the value and unit of the given `FloatWithUnits` instance to the provided IO stream.\n\nYou can use it like:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu) # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,279],"elapsed":2.435284262,"_type":"aimessage"}]
