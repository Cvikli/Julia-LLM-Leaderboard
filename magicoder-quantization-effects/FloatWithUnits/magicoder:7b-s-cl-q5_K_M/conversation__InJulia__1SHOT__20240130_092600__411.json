We then write a function `show()` that takes two arguments - an I/O stream (`io::IO`) and an object of the `FloatWithUnits` struct (`f`).\n\nInside this function, we use the built-in `print()` function to print the value and unit of the `FloatWithUnits` object. The `print()` function takes a variable number of arguments, so we can pass `$(f.value)` (the value of `f`) and `$(f.unit)` (the unit of `f`) directly as strings.\n\nThis `show()` method allows Julia to display an instance of the `FloatWithUnits` struct in a human-readable way, similar to how we would write `\"1.8 meters\"` manually.","status":200,"tokens":[0,267],"elapsed":2.337582584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
