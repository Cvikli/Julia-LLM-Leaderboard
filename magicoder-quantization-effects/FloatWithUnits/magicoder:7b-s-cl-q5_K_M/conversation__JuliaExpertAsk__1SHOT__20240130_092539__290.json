Here is how you could implement the `FloatWithUnits` struct:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T <: Number}\n    value::T\n    unit::String\nend\n\nBase.show(io::IO, f::FloatWithUnits) = print(io, string(f.value), \" \", f.unit)\n```\n\nThis `Base.show` method works for any object of type `FloatWithUnits`. The function `string(f.value)` converts the value to a string and then it concatenates it with space and unit. The `print` function outputs the result directly to the IO device (in this case, the standard output).\n\nYou can now create an instance of FloatWithUnits like this:\n```julia\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(f)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,225],"elapsed":1.963167869,"_type":"aimessage"}]
