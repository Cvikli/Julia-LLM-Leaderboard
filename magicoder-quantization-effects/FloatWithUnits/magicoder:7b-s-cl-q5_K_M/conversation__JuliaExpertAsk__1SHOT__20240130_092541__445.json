We then write a function that will be called when we try to print an instance of `FloatWithUnits`. The function takes an I/O stream (`io`) and the instance it is printing out (`fwu`), and prints `$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)` to that stream, effectively concatenating the value and unit with a space.","status":200,"tokens":[0,179],"elapsed":1.560421011,"_type":"aimessage"}]
