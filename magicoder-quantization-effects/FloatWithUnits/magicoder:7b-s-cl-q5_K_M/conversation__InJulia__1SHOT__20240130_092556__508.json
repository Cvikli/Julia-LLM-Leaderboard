Here is an example:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, x::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, x.value, \" \", x.unit)\nend\n\n# Test the function:\na = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(a) # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```\n\nIn this example, we define a `FloatWithUnits` struct with two fields, `value::Float64` and `unit::String`. We then use the built-in `Base.show()` function to provide our own string representation for an instance of `FloatWithUnits`. The `print(io, x.value, \" \", x.unit)` line is responsible for printing the value followed by a space and then the unit. This will display as \"1.8 meters\" when you call `println` on your struct.","status":200,"tokens":[74,245],"elapsed":2.161567954,"_type":"aimessage"}]
