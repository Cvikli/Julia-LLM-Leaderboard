The `show` function is then defined to handle how this struct is printed.\n\nYou can test it by creating an instance of `FloatWithUnits`:\n\n```julia\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(f)  # Output: \"1.8 meters\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,186],"elapsed":1.631772298,"_type":"aimessage"}]
