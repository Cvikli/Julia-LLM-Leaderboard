This function takes an input/output stream (`io`) and an object to be printed (`x`). It uses the `print` function to output the value and unit of the FloatWithUnits. The syntax `$(x.value)` and `$(x.unit)` is used to interpolate the values of these fields into the string being printed.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\nt = FloatWithUnits(18, \"meters\")  # create an instance\nprint(t)  # print the value and unit\n```\nThis will output: `18 meters`","status":200,"tokens":[0,233],"elapsed":1.818176796,"_type":"aimessage"}]
