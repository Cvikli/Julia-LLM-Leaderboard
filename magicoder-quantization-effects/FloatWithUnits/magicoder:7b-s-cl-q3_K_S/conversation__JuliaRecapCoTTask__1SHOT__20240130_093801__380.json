[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a struct `FloatWithUnits` with fields `value` and `unit` (make sure to define it!), write a `show` method for it that will concatenate the value and unit with a space like this \"1.8 meters\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you can solve this problem:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T <: Real}\n    value::T\n    unit::AbstractString\nend\n\nBase.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits) = print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\n```\n\nYou define a `struct` with two fields: `value`, and `unit`. The method `Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)` will be automatically called when you want to print your object as a string (`print` function).\n\nNote that it's important to use the type parameterization `<: Real` in order for the value field of our struct to only accept real numbers (like `1.0`, `2`, `-3`, etc.). If we didn't do this, we wouldn't be able to create a FloatWithUnits object with an integer as its value.\n\nFor example:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nshow(stdout, fwu)  # This will print \"1.8 meters\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,267],"elapsed":2.174578516,"_type":"aimessage"}]
