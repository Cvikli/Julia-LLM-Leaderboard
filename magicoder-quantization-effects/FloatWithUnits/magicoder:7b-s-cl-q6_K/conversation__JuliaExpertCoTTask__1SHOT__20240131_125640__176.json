In this case, we are defining it for instances of `FloatWithUnits`. Inside the function, `io::IO` represents the output stream (usually the console), and `fwu::FloatWithUnits` is the instance of `FloatWithUnits` that you want to print.\n\nThe `print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")` line prints out the value and unit of the `FloatWithUnits` object. The `$(variable)` syntax in Julia is a way to embed expressions inside strings. It's equivalent to calling `string(variable)`.\n\nLet's test this:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # Output: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,293],"elapsed":2.830224682,"_type":"aimessage"}]
