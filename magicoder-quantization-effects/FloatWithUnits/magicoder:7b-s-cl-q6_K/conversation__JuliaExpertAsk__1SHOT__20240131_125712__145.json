We then implement the `show` function for this struct, which takes an IO object (`io`) and an instance of `FloatWithUnits` (`f`). Inside this function, we use Julia's built-in `print` function to print the value and unit in the format \"value unit\".\n\nHere is how you can create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and print it:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,254],"elapsed":2.437809001,"_type":"aimessage"}]
