We then implement the `show` function for this type. The `Base.show` function is a built-in Julia method that controls how an object of a certain type is printed to the console.\n\nIn our implementation, we use `$(fwu.value)` to print the value of the struct and `$(fwu.unit)` to print the unit.\n\nYou can now create instances of `FloatWithUnits` and print them:\n```julia\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[105,246],"elapsed":2.384270379,"_type":"aimessage"}]
