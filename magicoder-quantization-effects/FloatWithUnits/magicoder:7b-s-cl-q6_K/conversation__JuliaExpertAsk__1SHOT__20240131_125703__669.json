Then we implement the `show` function that will print the value and unit in the desired format. The function uses the built-in `print` function to output the formatted string.\n\nFinally, we test this by creating an instance of `FloatWithUnits` with a floating point number and the unit \"meters\", then printing it out.","status":200,"tokens":[0,232],"elapsed":2.220113876,"_type":"aimessage"}]
