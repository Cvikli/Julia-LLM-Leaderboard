To showcase your approach to solving the problem, let's first start by defining our `FloatWithUnits` struct:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T <: Real}\n    value::T\n    unit::String\nend\n```\nThis defines a new type called `FloatWithUnits`, which is parameterized over any subtype of `Real`. This allows us to create an instance with floating-point numbers like 1.8 and string units \"meters\".\n\nNow, we can define our `show` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fwu.value * \" \")\n    println(io, fwu.unit)\nend\n```\nThis function overloads the `show` function in the `Base` module to display our custom type as a string concatenating value and unit with a space in between.\n\nFinally, we can create an instance of our type and print it:\n\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nshow(fwu)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,283],"elapsed":2.757023338,"_type":"aimessage"}]
