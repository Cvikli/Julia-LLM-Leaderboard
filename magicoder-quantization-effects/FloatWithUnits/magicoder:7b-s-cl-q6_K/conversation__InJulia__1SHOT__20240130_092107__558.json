The `T<:Real` part means that `value` must be some real number type (e.g., `Float64`, `Int64`).\n\n- Then, we implement the `Base.show` function for objects of our new type `FloatWithUnits`. This method takes in two parameters: `io::IO` and `fwu::FloatWithUnits`. The first one is a text I/O stream that we print to, and the second one is an instance of our struct.\n\n- Inside the `show` function, we use the built-in `print` method to print the value and unit of the `FloatWithUnits` object to the console. The string `\"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\"` does this by inserting the values of `fwu.value` and `fwu.unit` into a string template where `$( )` is used for variable substitution.\n\n- Finally, we use `@__MODULE__` to get the name of our module. We do this so that if the module is nested (i.e., it's not at the top level), the `show` function will still work correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,381],"elapsed":3.699693954,"_type":"aimessage"}]
