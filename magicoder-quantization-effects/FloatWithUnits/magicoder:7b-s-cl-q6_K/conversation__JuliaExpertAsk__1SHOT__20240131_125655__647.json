Here's how you could do it:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T<:Real}\n    value::T\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\nend\n```\nThis code creates a new type `FloatWithUnits` which is parameterized over any real number type (like Float64 or Int64). It has two fields: `value`, and `unit`. The `show` function is then overridden to print the value and unit when an instance of `FloatWithUnits` is printed.\n\nNow, if you create a `FloatWithUnits` object like this:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # This will print \"1.8 meters\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[105,236],"elapsed":2.287368679,"_type":"aimessage"}]
