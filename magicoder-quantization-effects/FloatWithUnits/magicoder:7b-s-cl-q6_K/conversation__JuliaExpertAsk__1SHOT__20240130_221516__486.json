The first argument `io::IO` specifies the output stream where the result should be printed. `fwu::FloatWithUnits` is the object of type FloatWithUnits that we want to print.\n\nThe `print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")` statement will print the value and unit of the struct separated by a space. The `$(...)`, also known as string interpolation, is used to embed expressions in strings for formatting and evaluation.","status":200,"tokens":[0,212],"elapsed":2.005679554,"_type":"aimessage"}]
