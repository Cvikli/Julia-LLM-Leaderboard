It has two fields: `value`, which is of type `T<:Real` (a real number), and `unit`, which is a string. We then define the `show` function for this struct. This function takes an IO stream (`io`) and a `FloatWithUnits` object (`fwu`). It prints the value and unit to the IO stream.\n\nYou can test it with:\n```julia\njulia> FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,219],"elapsed":2.087652519,"_type":"aimessage"}]
