The `Base.show` function is used to define how the object of type `FloatWithUnits` will be printed when called with `print`. The method takes an `IO` stream (which represents where to print) and the object itself (`x::FloatWithUnits`). Inside the method, it prints the value and unit separated by a space.","status":200,"tokens":[0,201],"elapsed":1.925572797,"_type":"aimessage"}]
