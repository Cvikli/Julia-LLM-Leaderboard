It's responsible for printing the object to the console. In our case, we want to print the value and unit of our struct. The `x.value` and `x.unit` are fields of the struct `FloatWithUnits`.\n\nYou can now create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and use `show` function:\n```julia\njulia> x = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,203],"elapsed":1.917574252,"_type":"aimessage"}]
