We override it for our `FloatWithUnits` struct so that when we call `show`, it prints out the value and unit of the FloatWithUnits instance separated by a space.\n\nFor example, if you create an instance like this:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n```\nand then print it to the console using `show`, it will display as \"1.8 meters\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,210],"elapsed":2.02080935,"_type":"aimessage"}]
