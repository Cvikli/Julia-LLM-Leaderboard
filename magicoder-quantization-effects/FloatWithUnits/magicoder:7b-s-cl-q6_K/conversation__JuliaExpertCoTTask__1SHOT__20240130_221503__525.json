This struct has two fields: `value` and `unit`, which are both of type `T<:Real`, meaning they can be any subtype of the Real number type. \n\nThen, we define a function `show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)` that takes an IO stream (which is where the output would go) and a FloatWithUnits object as arguments. Inside this function, we use `print` to print out the value and unit of the FloatWithUnits object separated by a space.\n\nNow if you try to print a FloatWithUnits object like `FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")`, it will output: \n\n```julia\njulia> FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,285],"elapsed":2.722190492,"_type":"aimessage"}]
