It takes two arguments: an IO object (which represents a stream or a file that receives output), and an instance of `FloatWithUnits`. The function prints out the value and unit in the format specified, with a space between them. \n\nYou can then use this defined method to display your `FloatWithUnits` instances like so:\n```julia\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(f)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,216],"elapsed":2.109157395,"_type":"aimessage"}]
