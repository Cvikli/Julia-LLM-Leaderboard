It takes three arguments, an IO stream (`io::IO`), the object itself (`x::FloatWithUnits`) and additional arguments specific to each function (in this case none). The method prints the value and unit of the FloatWithUnits instance. \n\nNow let's test our code with your provided data:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)\n```\nThis will print `1.8 meters`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,237],"elapsed":2.301780932,"_type":"aimessage"}]
