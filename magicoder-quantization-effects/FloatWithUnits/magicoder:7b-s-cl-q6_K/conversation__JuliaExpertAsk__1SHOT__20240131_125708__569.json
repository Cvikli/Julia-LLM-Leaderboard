We then use the built-in `print` function to print the value of the `FloatWithUnits` object followed by its unit.\n\nYou can now test this with:\n```julia\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nshow(stdout, f)\n```\nAnd it should output `\"1.8 meters\"`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,205],"elapsed":1.960654877,"_type":"aimessage"}]
