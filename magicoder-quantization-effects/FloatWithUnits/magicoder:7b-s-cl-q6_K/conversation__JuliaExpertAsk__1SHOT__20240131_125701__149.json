Then it creates a new struct called `FloatWithUnits`. The `show` function is defined to take an IO stream (`io`) and a `FloatWithUnits` object (`f`). It prints out the value and unit in the format you specified.\n\nYou can use this `FloatWithUnits` type like this:\n```julia\nx = FloatWithUnits(1.8, u\"meter\")\nprintln(x)  # Outputs: \"1.8 meters\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,241],"elapsed":2.311314727,"_type":"aimessage"}]
