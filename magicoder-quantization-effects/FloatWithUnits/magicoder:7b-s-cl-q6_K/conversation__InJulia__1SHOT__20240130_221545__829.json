The `show` method is then defined to print out the value and unit in the format \"value unit\".\n\nYou can test this by creating an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and printing it:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,236],"elapsed":2.23926597,"_type":"aimessage"}]
