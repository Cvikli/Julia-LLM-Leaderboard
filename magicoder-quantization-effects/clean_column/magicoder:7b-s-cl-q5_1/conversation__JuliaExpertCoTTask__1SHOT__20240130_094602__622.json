Then, the `replace` method is called twice on the result - first with ' ', replacing spaces with underscores, and then with '-', replacing hyphens with underscores. The final cleaned column name is returned as output.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes the input is a string representing a column name. If the input might be something other than a string, you'll need to add additional error checking or handling code to handle that situation.","status":200,"tokens":[0,189],"elapsed":1.710529586,"_type":"aimessage"}]
