[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function that can be used to clean column names in Julia. The instructions are left as placeholders and would typically need to be replaced by the specific requirements of your problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    # lowercase, strip whitespace, replace spaces with underscore \n    return replace(replace(lowercase(strip(col)), \" \" => \"_\"), \"-\" => \"_\")\nend\n```\nYou can then call this function on a column name:\n\n```julia\ncolumn_name = \" My Column-With Spaces and Hyphens \"\ncleaned_name = clean_column(column_name)\nprintln(cleaned_name) # prints: my_column_with_spaces_and_hyphens\n```\nIn the function above, `lowercase` transforms all uppercase characters in a string to lowercase, `strip` removes any leading or trailing whitespaces from a string, and `replace` is used twice to replace all spaces with underscores. The output type of this function is `AbstractString`, which allows it to work with both ASCII strings and Unicode.","status":200,"tokens":[0,251],"elapsed":2.309406309,"_type":"aimessage"}]
