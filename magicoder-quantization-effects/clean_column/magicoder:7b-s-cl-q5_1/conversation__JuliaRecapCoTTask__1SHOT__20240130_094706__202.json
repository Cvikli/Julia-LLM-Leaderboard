[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The function `clean_column` would look something like this:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    return replace(lowercase(strip(replace(col, \"-\", \" \"))), \" \" => \"_\")\nend\n``` \n\nThis function takes in a string `col` and removes any leading or trailing whitespaces. It then replaces all spaces with underscores using the built-in `replace` function from Julia's standard library. After that, it converts the entire string to lowercase just for good measure. The `strip(replace(col, \"-\", \" \"))` part of the code is responsible for this operation. \n\nThis cleaned column name can be returned as a result by simply returning the modified string. The function signature is `::AbstractString` because we want the function to return a string. If you have any special instructions, kindly provide them so that they can be taken into account in the function's implementation.","status":200,"tokens":[0,214],"elapsed":1.97467378,"_type":"aimessage"}]
