Then, it replaces all spaces with underscores using `replace()`. The `|>` operator is used here for readability but you can also use parentheses `( )` to achieve the same result.\n\nHowever, if your column name has a hyphen and not a space then you might want to replace only one instance of the hyphen or use a different character as separator:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col) \n    return replace(lowercase(strip(col)), ' -' => \"_\") |> replace('-' => \"_\")\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,208],"elapsed":1.868351175,"_type":"aimessage"}]
