Then it replaces any spaces or hyphens with underscores using the `replace` function, and finally removes any leading or trailing whitespaces using the `strip` function. The result is returned by the function.\n\nHere's how you would use this function:\n```julia\ncol = \" My Column   \";\nclean_col = clean_column(col);\nprintln(\"Cleaned column name is : $clean_col\");\n```\nThe output of this code will be: \n`Cleaned column name is : my_column`","status":200,"tokens":[108,204],"elapsed":1.833390391,"_type":"aimessage"}]
