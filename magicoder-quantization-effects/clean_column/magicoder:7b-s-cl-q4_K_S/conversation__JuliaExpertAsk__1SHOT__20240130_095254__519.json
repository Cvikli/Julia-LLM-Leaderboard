It uses `replace` function to replace all spaces and hyphens in the string with underscores. This can be achieved by passing a regular expression (`r\"[\\s-]\"`) that matches either a whitespace or a hyphen as the first argument of `replace`. The second argument is what to replace matched characters with (in this case, an underscore).","status":200,"tokens":[0,156],"elapsed":1.205770836,"_type":"aimessage"}]
