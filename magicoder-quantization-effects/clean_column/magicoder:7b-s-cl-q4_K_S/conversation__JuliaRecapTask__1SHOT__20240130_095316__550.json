[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the `clean_column` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)::String\n    return replace(lowercase(strip(col)), \" \" => \"_\")\nend\n```\nThis function works by converting the input string to lower case, removing leading and trailing spaces, and replacing all spaces with underscores. The `replace` function is a built-in Julia function that replaces occurrences of one substring with another in a given string. In this case, it's used to replace all spaces with underscores.\n\nYou can use the function as follows:\n\n```julia\ncol = \" My Column \"\ncleaned_col = clean_column(col)\nprintln(cleaned_col) # prints \"my_column\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,176],"elapsed":1.389495437,"_type":"aimessage"}]
