[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col)\n    return replace(lowercase(strip(col)), r\"[-\\s]\" => \"_\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes an input string `col` and applies the following transformations: \n1. It converts all characters in the string to lower case, using the `lowercase` function.\n2. Then it trims any leading or trailing whitespaces with `strip`.\n3. Next, it replaces any spaces or hyphens in the string with underscores, using the `replace` function and a regular expression. The `r\"[-\\s]\" => \"_\"` part of this statement is looking for either a space (`-`) or a hyphen (`\\s`) and replacing it with an underscore (`_`). \n\nThis should work for any valid input string, including those that have leading/trailing spaces, contain spaces instead of underscores, or are entirely capitalized.","status":200,"tokens":[0,217],"elapsed":1.720213409,"_type":"aimessage"}]
