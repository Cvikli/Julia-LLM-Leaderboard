Here's a simple implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col)\n    return replace(lowercase(strip(col)), \" \", \"_\")\nend\n\nclean_column(\"My Column\")  # Output: \"my_column\"\n```\nIn this function, `lowercase` is used to convert the string to lower case letters only. `strip` is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespaces. The `replace` function is then used with the first argument as `\" \"` and second argument as `\"_\"`. This replaces all spaces in the string with underscores.\n\nRemember that this implementation assumes that you are passing a string for column name. If your input can be different, consider using error checking to ensure the correct data type is passed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,196],"elapsed":1.522307287,"_type":"aimessage"}]
