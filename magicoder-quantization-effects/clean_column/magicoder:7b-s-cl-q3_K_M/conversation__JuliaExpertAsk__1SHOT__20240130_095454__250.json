The `replace` function replaces all substrings that match the regular expression with another string, in this case it replaces spaces or hyphens (\"_-\" or \" \") with underscore (\"_\").\n2. The `strip(col)` function removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the column name.\n3. The `lowercase(col)` function converts all characters to lowercase so the column names are consistently lowercased regardless of the original casing. \n\nNote: In order to use this function you should have installed Julia programming language in your system, and be able to run it from a terminal or command prompt.","status":200,"tokens":[0,202],"elapsed":1.556421232,"_type":"aimessage"}]
