[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple Julia function that implements the requirements of your problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    return replace(lowercase(strip(col)), r\"[\\s-]+\" => \"_\")\nend\n```\nThis function works by first converting the column name to lower case (to ensure that it is not case sensitive), then removing any leading or trailing spaces. It further replaces all occurrences of one or more white spaces and hyphens with underscores, which fulfills your requirement to replace these characters with underscores in the cleaned column name.\n\nTo use this function for a specific column, you would just pass the string representation of that column:\n```julia\ncolumn = \"My Column\"\nclean_column(column)\n```\nThis will return `\"my_column\"` which is the cleaned version of your column name according to your requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,199],"elapsed":1.561428465,"_type":"aimessage"}]
