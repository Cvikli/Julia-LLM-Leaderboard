The function is named `clean_column` and it takes a string as input (the column name). Here's how it looks:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col)::String\n    return replace(lowercase(strip(col)), r\"[\\s-]+\" => \"_\")\nend\n```\nIn the function above, `replace` replaces all spaces and hyphens in the string with an underscore. Then, we use `lowercase` to make the string lowercased and `strip` to remove any leading or trailing whitespaces.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\ncolumn_name = \" My Column  \"\ncleaned_name = clean_column(column_name)\nprintln(cleaned_name) # Output: my_column\n```\nAs you see, the function works as expected. It takes a string and returns a new string that represents the same information but with some modifications (spaces replaced by underscores, case normalized).","status":200,"tokens":[0,239],"elapsed":2.042304124,"_type":"aimessage"}]
