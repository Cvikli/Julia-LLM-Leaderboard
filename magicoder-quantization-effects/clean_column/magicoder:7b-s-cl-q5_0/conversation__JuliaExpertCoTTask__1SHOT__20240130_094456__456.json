The regular expression (regex) `\"[\\s-]\"` matches any white space character or hyphen.\n\nNow let's test our function:\n```julia\nprintln(clean_column(\"My Column\")) # Outputs: \"my_column\"\n```\nThis code will print out the cleaned column name after calling our `clean_column` function with \"My Column\" as input. The output is \"my_column\", which matches what we expected from our example.","status":200,"tokens":[0,204],"elapsed":1.750806894,"_type":"aimessage"}]
