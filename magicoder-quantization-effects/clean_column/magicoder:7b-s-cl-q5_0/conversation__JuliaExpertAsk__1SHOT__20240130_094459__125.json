Then, we convert the string to lower case using `lowercase`. The `replace` function replaces all spaces or hyphens in the column name with underscores. This is done by the regular expression (`r\"[ -]\"`), which matches either a space or a hyphen.","status":200,"tokens":[108,130],"elapsed":1.137175431,"_type":"aimessage"}]
