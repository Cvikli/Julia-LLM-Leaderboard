For example, `clean_column(\"My Column\")` will return `\"my_column\"`. This function first converts the input to lower case and strips any leading or trailing whitespaces using the `strip` function. Then it replaces all spaces and hyphens in the cleaned string with underscores using the `replace` function. The regular expression `r\"[\\s-]\" => \"_\"` is used to match either a space or a hyphen and replace them with an underscore.","status":200,"tokens":[0,172],"elapsed":2.975735108,"_type":"aimessage"}]
