After that it replaces all spaces (\" \") and hyphens (\"-\") with underscores (\"_\"), which is the preferred format for column names in databases like SQL.\n\nTo test this function you can use following code:\n\n```julia\nprintln(clean_column(\" My Column \")) # Outputs: my_column\nprintln(clean_column(\"Another-Column\"))  # Outputs: another_column\nprintln(clean_column(\"LastOne\")) # Outputs: lastone\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,196],"elapsed":3.43921183,"_type":"aimessage"}]
