Then it converts all characters in `col` to lower case using the `lowercase()` function. After that, it replaces any sequence of spaces or hyphens with an underscore using the `replace()` function. The regular expression `r\"[\\s-]+\"` matches one or more space characters or hyphens.","status":200,"tokens":[108,141],"elapsed":2.434172852,"_type":"aimessage"}]
