It replaces any spaces or hyphens in `col` with underscores using the `replace()` function. The regular expression `r\"\\s|-\"` matches either a whitespace character (`\\s`) or a hyphen (`-`).\n\nYou can test this function with your example:\n\n```julia\nprintln(clean_column(\"My Column\"))  # Outputs \"my_column\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[227,177],"elapsed":25.31024227,"_type":"aimessage"}]
