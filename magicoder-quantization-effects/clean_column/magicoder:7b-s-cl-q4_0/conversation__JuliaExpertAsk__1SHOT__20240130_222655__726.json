The `replace()` function is used with a regular expression to replace one or more occurrences of whitespace characters (spaces and hyphens) with an underscore. The `strip()` function is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace, while the `lowercase()` function is used to convert all uppercase letters in the string to lowercase.","status":200,"tokens":[108,157],"elapsed":1.190215817,"_type":"aimessage"}]
