Then it converts the string to lower case with `lowercase(strip(col))`. Finally, it replaces all spaces and hyphens in the string with underscores using the `replace()` function. The regular expression `r\"[\\s-]\"` matches any space or hyphen.","status":200,"tokens":[0,133],"elapsed":1.000401314,"_type":"aimessage"}]
