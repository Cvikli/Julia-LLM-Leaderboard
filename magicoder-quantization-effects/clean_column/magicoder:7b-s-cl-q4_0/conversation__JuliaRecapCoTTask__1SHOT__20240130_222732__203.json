[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function that meets the requirements:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    # Lowercase the string, remove leading and trailing whitespaces, replace spaces with underscores.\n    return replace(lowercase(strip(col)), r\"[\\s-]+\" => \"_\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a string `col` as input and returns a cleaned version of it. The `AbstractString` type hint ensures that the function only accepts strings, which is a good practice to avoid errors in Julia due to wrong types being passed into functions. \n\nThe `lowercase(strip(col))` part makes sure the string is all lower case and has no leading or trailing spaces. \n\nThe `replace(lowercase(strip(col)), r\"[\\s-]+\" => \"_\")` part replaces any sequence of spaces or hyphens with a single underscore, which is what you asked for in your problem description. The regular expression `r\"[\\s-]+\"` matches one or more whitespace characters (spaces and hyphens) and the replacement `\"_\"` inserts an underscore where these matched characters were. \n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\ncolumn = \" My Column \";\ncleaned_column = clean_column(column);\nprintln(cleaned_column); # Outputs: my_column\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,309],"elapsed":2.351746763,"_type":"aimessage"}]
