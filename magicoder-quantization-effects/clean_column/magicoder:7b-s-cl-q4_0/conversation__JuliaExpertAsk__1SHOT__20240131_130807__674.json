It first converts all characters in `col` to lower case using the `lowercase` function, then strips any leading or trailing whitespaces using the `strip` function. The regular expression `r\"\\s|\\-\"` matches either a space or a hyphen, and the replacement `\"_\"` replaces these matched characters with an underscore.","status":200,"tokens":[0,136],"elapsed":1.017038341,"_type":"aimessage"}]
