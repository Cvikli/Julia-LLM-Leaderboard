It replaces all spaces and hyphens with underscores using a regular expression (`r\"[\\s-]\"`) and the `replace` function. The result is returned as output of the function.\n\nFor example, if you call `clean_column(\"My Column\")`, it will return `\"my_column\"`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,149],"elapsed":1.106719802,"_type":"aimessage"}]
