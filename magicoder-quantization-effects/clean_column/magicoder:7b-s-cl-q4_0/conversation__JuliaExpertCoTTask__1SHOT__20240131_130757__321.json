The `replace()` function is used to replace any spaces (\" \") and hyphens (\"-\") with underscores (\"_\"). The result of this function would be \"my_column\" for input \"My Column\".\n\nYou can test it as follows:\n```julia\nprintln(clean_column(\"My Column\")) # Outputs: my_column\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,156],"elapsed":1.172708729,"_type":"aimessage"}]
