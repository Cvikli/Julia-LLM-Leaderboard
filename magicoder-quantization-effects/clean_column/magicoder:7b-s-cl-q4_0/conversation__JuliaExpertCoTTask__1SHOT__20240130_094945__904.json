It converts all characters in the string to lowercase using `lowercase` function.\n2. It strips any leading or trailing white spaces from the string using `strip` function.\n3. Then, replaces all occurrences of space ' ' with underscore '_' and hyphen '-' with underscore. This is achieved by replacing the spaces (' ') and hyphens ('-') in the string with underscores ('_'). \n\nWhen called on \"My Column\", it returns \"my_column\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,212],"elapsed":1.609209665,"_type":"aimessage"}]
