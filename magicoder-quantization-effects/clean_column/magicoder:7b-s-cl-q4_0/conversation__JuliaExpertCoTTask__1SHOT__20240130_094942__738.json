The `lowercase` function makes sure that the string is in lower case, and `strip` gets rid of any leading or trailing whitespaces. This is achieved by using a regular expression (`r\"[ _-]+\"`), which matches one or more spaces or hyphens, replacing them with an underscore.","status":200,"tokens":[0,170],"elapsed":1.295808977,"_type":"aimessage"}]
