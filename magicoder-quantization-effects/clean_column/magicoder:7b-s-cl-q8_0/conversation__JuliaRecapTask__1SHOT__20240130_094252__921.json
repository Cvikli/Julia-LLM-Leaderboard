[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    return replace(lowercase(strip(col)), r\"[ -]\" => \"_\")\nend\n```\nIn this function, `replace` is a built-in Julia function that substitutes all occurrences of a regular expression (specified by the `r\"[ -]\"` pattern) in the input string with another string (`_`). The `lowercase` and `strip` functions are also standard library functions that convert to lowercase and remove leading/trailing whitespace, respectively.\n\nPlease note that this function will fail if the input is not a string (AbstractString type). If you want to support any other data types as well, you might need to add more type assertions or error handling code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,174],"elapsed":1.995414054,"_type":"aimessage"}]
