[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple function written in Julia that accomplishes the task:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col)\n    # Lowercase, strip leading/trailing spaces and replace spaces and hyphens with underscores.\n    return replace(lowercase(strip(col)), r\"[- ]\" => \"_\")\nend\n```\nThis function first converts the column name to lowercase using `lowercase()`, removes any leading or trailing whitespaces using `strip()`, then replaces any spaces and hyphens with underscores. It finally returns the cleaned up version of the column name.\n\nIf you want to handle special characters that are not just spaces and hyphens, you can modify the regular expression in the `replace()` function accordingly. For example, if you also wanted to replace periods or commas, you could use:\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col)\n    # Lowercase, strip leading/trailing spaces and replace spaces, hyphens, periods with underscores.\n    return replace(lowercase(strip(col)), r\"[- .,]\" => \"_\")\nend\n```\nThis would also replace periods or commas with underscore in the column name.","status":200,"tokens":[0,264],"elapsed":3.007407401,"_type":"aimessage"}]
