For instance, `clean_column(\"My Column\")` would return `\"my_column\"`. \n\nThis function works by first using the `lowercase` and `strip` functions to convert all letters in the string to lower case and remove any leading or trailing whitespaces. It then uses the `replace` function with a regular expression to replace all spaces and hyphens with underscores.","status":200,"tokens":[0,155],"elapsed":1.753204278,"_type":"aimessage"}]
