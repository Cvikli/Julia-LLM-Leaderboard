[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's a Julia function named `clean_column` which cleans a column name according to the specifications:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    return replace(lowercase(strip(col)), r\"[\\s-]\" => \"_\")\nend\n```\nThis function first converts the string to lowercase, then removes any leading or trailing whitespaces using `strip` and replaces any spaces or hyphens with underscores. The regex `\\s-` matches either a space or a hyphen, and the replacement `r\"[\\s-]\" => \"_\"` replaces each match with an underscore.\n  \nNote that this function assumes that your Julia version supports AbstractString type which all string types are subtypes of including Char, String etc. If it doesn't, you can replace AbstractString with String but you might get a warning about the performance cost.","status":200,"tokens":[0,197],"elapsed":2.242106795,"_type":"aimessage"}]
