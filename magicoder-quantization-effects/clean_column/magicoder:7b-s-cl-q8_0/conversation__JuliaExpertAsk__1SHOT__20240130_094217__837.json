Here's a simple function that accomplishes this:\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)\n    return replace(lowercase(strip(col)), r\"[ -]\" => \"_\")\nend\n```\nHere, we first strip any leading or trailing spaces from the input string (`strip(col)`), then convert it to lowercase (`lowercase(strip(col))`), and finally replace all spaces and hyphens in the result with underscores (`replace(lowercase(strip(col)), r\"[ -]\" => \"_\")`). The `r\"[ -]\"` inside `replace` is a regular expression that matches either a space or a hyphen.","status":200,"tokens":[0,173],"elapsed":1.927283188,"_type":"aimessage"}]
