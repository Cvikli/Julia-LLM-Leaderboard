It first converts all characters to lower case using the `lowercase()` function, so that \"My Column\", for example, becomes \"my column\".\n2. Then it removes any leading or trailing whitespaces using the `strip()` function.\n3. Finally, it replaces all spaces and hyphens with underscores using the `replace()` function. \n\nThe regular expression `\"[\\s-]+\"` matches one or more spaces (\"\\s\") or hyphens (\"-\"), and is replaced by an underscore \"_\". This way, all spaces and hyphens are replaced with a single underscore, preserving words intact but removing extra spaces between them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,215],"elapsed":2.4222048,"_type":"aimessage"}]
