The cleaning consists of three steps: lowercasing the column name to make it case insensitive, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces from both sides, and replacing spaces and hyphens with underscores using `replace` function with a regular expression.","status":200,"tokens":[0,157],"elapsed":1.531451485,"_type":"aimessage"}]
