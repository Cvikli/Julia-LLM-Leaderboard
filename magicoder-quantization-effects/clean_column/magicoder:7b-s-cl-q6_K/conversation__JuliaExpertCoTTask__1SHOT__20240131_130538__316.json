Here is how you can solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)\n    return replace(lowercase(strip(col)), r\"[\\s-]\" => \"_\")\nend\n\n# Testing the function\nprintln(clean_column(\"My Column\"))  # Output: \"my_column\"\n```\nThis function works by using the `replace` function from the `Base.Strings` module in Julia to replace any spaces or hyphens with underscores, and then lowercases and strips all leading/trailing whitespaces of the input string. The `r\"[\\s-]\" => \"_\"` part is a regular expression that matches either whitespace characters (`\\s`) or hyphen character (`-`), and replaces them with an underscore.","status":200,"tokens":[0,175],"elapsed":1.693761708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
