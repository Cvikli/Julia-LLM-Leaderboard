This is done using the `replace` function in Julia which replaces matched patterns in a string. Here we are replacing space and hyphen characters with an underscore character using regular expression (regex) pattern. The `strip` function removes leading and trailing whitespaces, and `lowercase` function converts all characters to lower case.\n\nYou can test this function as follows:\n\n```julia\nprintln(clean_column(\" My Column \"))  # Outputs: my_column\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,193],"elapsed":1.860670693,"_type":"aimessage"}]
