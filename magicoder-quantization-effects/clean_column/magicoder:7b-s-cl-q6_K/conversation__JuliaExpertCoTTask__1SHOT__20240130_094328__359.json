Then it strips any leading or trailing spaces from that string using `strip`. Afterward, it replaces all remaining spaces and hyphens with underscores using `replace` and a regular expression. The resulting cleaned column name is then returned by the function.","status":200,"tokens":[227,160],"elapsed":3.586471794,"_type":"aimessage"}]
