Here's how you can implement the `clean_column` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)::String\n    return replace(lowercase(strip(col)), ' ' => \"_\", '-' => '_')\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, we first use the `strip` function to remove any leading or trailing whitespace. Then we convert it into lower case using `lowercase`. After that, we replace all spaces and hyphens with underscores using the `replace` function. This is done by specifying `' ' => \"_\"` and `-' => '_'` as arguments.","status":200,"tokens":[0,137],"elapsed":1.336086991,"_type":"aimessage"}]
