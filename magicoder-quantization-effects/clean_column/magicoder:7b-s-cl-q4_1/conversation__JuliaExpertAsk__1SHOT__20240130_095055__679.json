Inside the function, we first convert all characters to lower case using the `lowercase` function, and then remove any hyphens with replace. We use two replaces here - one for spaces and another for hyphens. The resulting string is then returned by the function. \n\nLet's test it:\n```julia\nprintln(clean_column(\"My Column\")) # Output: \"my_column\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,159],"elapsed":1.268367334,"_type":"aimessage"}]
