This function uses the built-in `replace` method to replace spaces and hyphens with underscores, as well as the `lstrip`, `rstrip`, and `lowercasefirst` functions from the `Base` package for string manipulation:\n\n```julia\nimport Base: lowercasefirst\n\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString) \n    # replace spaces and hyphens with underscores\n    col = replace(col, \" \", \"_\")\n    col = replace(col, \"-\", \"_\")\n\n    # lowercase the first character of the string\n    col = lowercasefirst(col)\n    \n    # remove leading or trailing whitespaces\n    col = lstrip(rstrip(col))\n\n    return col\nend\n```\nPlease note that you need to import `Base: lowercasefirst` function from Base package if it's not imported already. \nYou can call this function with any string as argument, and it will clean the column name according to your rules. For example:\n\n```julia\nclean_column(\"My Column\") # returns \"my_column\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,256],"elapsed":2.053629176,"_type":"aimessage"}]
