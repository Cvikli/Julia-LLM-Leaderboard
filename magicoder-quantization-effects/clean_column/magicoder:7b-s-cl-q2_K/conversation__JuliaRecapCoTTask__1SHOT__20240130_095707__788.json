[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution for the task using Julia language:\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col)\n    col = lowercase(col); # convert to lower case\n    col = replace(col, ' ' => \"_\"); # replace space with underscore \n    col = replace(col, '-' => \"_\"); # replace hyphen with underscore \n    return col;\nend\n```\nThis function accepts a string `col` and cleans it as described. The lowercase() function transforms the string to all lower case letters. Replace() function is used for replacing any space or hyphen in the string with an underscore \"_\". The cleaned column name is then returned. \n\nHowever, if there are special instructions, they might need a different approach. For example, suppose we have to keep only alphanumeric characters and replace all non-alphanumeric characters with a specific character, we would use the following function:\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col, replacement)\n    col = lowercase(col); # convert to lower case\n    for c in collect(eachchar(col))\n        if !isletter(c) && !isnumber(c)\n            c = replacement;\n        end\n    end\n    return col;\nend\n```\nThis function accepts a string `col` and the character `replacement`. It cleans the string by transforming all non-alphanumeric characters to the `replacement`. The lowercase() function transforms the string to all lower case letters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,332],"elapsed":2.587727046,"_type":"aimessage"}]
