Then it replaces all occurrences of a space or hyphen with an underscore using the `replace` function, which takes regular expressions as input and allows for multiple transformations in a single line. The argument `r\"[ -]\" => \"_\"` is a regular expression that matches either a space or a hyphen.","status":200,"tokens":[0,141],"elapsed":1.132018996,"_type":"aimessage"}]
