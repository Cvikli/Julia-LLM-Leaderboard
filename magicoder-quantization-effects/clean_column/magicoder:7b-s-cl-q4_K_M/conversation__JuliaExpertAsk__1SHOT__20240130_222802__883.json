Then it replaces all spaces and hyphens with underscores using the `replace` function. The regular expression `r\"[ -]\"` matches either a space or a hyphen.\n\nYou can test this function as follows:\n```julia\nprintln(clean_column(\"My Column\"))  # Outputs \"my_column\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[108,151],"elapsed":1.213156756,"_type":"aimessage"}]
