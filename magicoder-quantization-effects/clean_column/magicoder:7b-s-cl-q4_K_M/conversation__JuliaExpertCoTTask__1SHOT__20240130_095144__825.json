This function uses regular expressions to replace spaces and hyphens with underscores:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col)\n    return replace(lowercase(strip(col)), r\"[\\s-]\" => \"_\")\nend\n\nprintln(clean_column(\"My Column\"))  # Output: \"my_column\"\n```\nThe `replace` function is used to replace substrings matching the regular expression with another string. The `r\"[\\s-]\"` matches any whitespace or hyphen, and `=> \"_\"` replaces it with an underscore. The `lowercase` function makes sure that all letters are in lower case and `strip` removes leading and trailing whitespaces.","status":200,"tokens":[0,162],"elapsed":1.250763943,"_type":"aimessage"}]
