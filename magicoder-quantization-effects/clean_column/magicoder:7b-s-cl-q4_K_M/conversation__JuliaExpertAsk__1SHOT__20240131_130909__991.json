It also converts the whole string to lowercase. The regular expression `\\s|-` matches either a space or a hyphen, and `replace(col, r\"\\s|-\", \"_\")` replaces each match in `col` with an underscore. The function `lowercase(col)` then converts the entire string `col` to lowercase.","status":200,"tokens":[108,152],"elapsed":1.23060015,"_type":"aimessage"}]
