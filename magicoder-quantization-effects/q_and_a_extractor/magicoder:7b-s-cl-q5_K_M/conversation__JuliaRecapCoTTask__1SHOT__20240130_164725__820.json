[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here's an example of how you might approach this task using Julia. Please replace `{{instructions}}` with actual instructions, if available:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(strip(md), \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestionSection = false\n    inAnswerSection = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestionSection = true\n            inAnswerSection = false\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inAnswerSection = true\n            inQuestionSection = false\n        elseif inQuestionSection && !startswith(line, \"## \")\n            question *= line[7:end]\n        elseif inAnswerSection && !startswith(line, \"## \")\n            answer *= line[7:end]\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the markdown string into lines and then going through each line. If a line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it changes the state of `inQuestionSection` or `inAnswerSection`, respectively, to true and also processes the next line in those sections (ignoring lines starting with \"## \"). Otherwise, if you're currently in one of these sections and the line does not start with \"## \", it appends the content to either `question` or `answer`. Finally, after going through all the lines, it returns a tuple of `question` and `answer`, stripped of leading spaces and newlines.\n\nYou can use this function like so: \n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nThis is a question?\n## \nYes, this is also part of the question!\n\n# Answer\nThis is an answer to the question above.\n\"\"\"\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md))\n```\n\nPlease adjust the function based on your exact requirements and instructions for parsing the markdown.","status":200,"tokens":[0,463],"elapsed":4.175593287,"_type":"aimessage"}]
