[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use regular expressions (regex) to extract these sections from the markdown. Here is an example solution using Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = match(r\"# Question(.*?)(?=^[#])\", md, dotall=true)\n    answer = match(r\"# Answer(.*?)(?=^[#])\", md, dotall=true)\n    \n    return (strip(question.captures[1]), strip(answer.captures[1]))\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, the regular expression pattern `r\"...\"` is used to match the sections of interest. The `dotall` option `true` allows for matching across multiple lines. \n\nThe question and answer are captured as `.captures[1]` since the full matched text from regex also includes the section markers (e.g., `# Question`). This method strips leading whitespace and newline characters from each extracted string using Julia's built-in `strip` function.\n\nNote that this is a very basic example, and it assumes that there will always be one `# Question` followed by an `# Answer`. If the markdown has multiple questions/answers or other non-standard formats, you might need to adjust the regular expressions and the strip operations accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,297],"elapsed":2.660047442,"_type":"aimessage"}]
