Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple python function that implements this:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = re.search(r'\\n# Question(.*?)(?=\\n# Answer|\\Z)', md, re.DOTALL).group().strip()\n    answer = re.search(r'\\n# Answer(.*?)(\\n# Question|\\Z)', md, re.DOTALL).group().strip()\n    \n    return (question, answer) if question and answer else None\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to search for the sections `Question` and `Answer`. The `re.DOTALL` flag makes sure that `.` matches any character at all, including newlines. \n\nIf a `# Question` or `# Answer` section is found, it extracts everything until the next `# Question` or end of file (`\\Z`), strips leading and trailing whitespaces with `strip()`, and returns the question followed by answer as a tuple. If no question or answer sections are found, it returns None.\n\nNote that this assumes that `# Answer` always directly follows `# Question`, and that there's only one `# Question` section before the first `# Answer`. Similarly, it assumes that each `Answer` is directly followed by another `Question` or end of file. If these assumptions don't hold in your markdown, you may need to adjust the regular expressions accordingly.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```python\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(md))  # prints ('What is the capital of France?', 'The capital of France is Paris.')\n```","status":200,"tokens":[128,394],"elapsed":3.528805803,"_type":"aimessage"}]
