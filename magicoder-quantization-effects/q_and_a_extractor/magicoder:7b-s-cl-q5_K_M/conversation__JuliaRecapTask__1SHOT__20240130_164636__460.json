[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

The `MD` library is used to parse the markdown text, then we extract the question and answer sections with a simple regex.\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\nusing Dates: DateFormat,DateFormat,ENGINEERING_NOTATION_DATEFORMAT\nimport REGEX \n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    doc = parse_md(md)\n    \n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    for elem in children(doc.content[1])\n        if isa(elem,Paragraph)\n            text = string(elem.content...)\n            if match(r\"# Question\", text) !== nothing\n                question = strip(text[end-length(question)+2:end]) # this will extract the part after '# Question' and before '# Answer' \n            elseif match(r\"# Answer\", text) !== nothing\n                answer = strip(text[end-length(answer)+2:end]) # this will extract the part after '# Answer'\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nNote that this function assumes that the markdown text is formatted as per your instructions, i.e., each paragraph starting with '# Question ' or '# Answer ' is a section header for question or answer respectively. If there can be other paragraphs starting with '#' in the middle of the document, it might not work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[0,336],"elapsed":3.045212509,"_type":"aimessage"}]
