[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    for line in lines \n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question = chomp(line[13:end])\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer = chomp(line[10:end])\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the markdown string into an array of lines. Then it loops over each line. If a line starts with \"# Question\", it assigns the rest of the line to `question`. If a line starts with \"# Answer\", it assigns the rest of the line to `answer`. \n\nThe `chomp` function is used to remove any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,233],"elapsed":2.042722964,"_type":"aimessage"}]
