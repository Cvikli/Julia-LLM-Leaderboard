[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can achieve this:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestion = false\n    inAnswer = false\n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestion = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inAnswer = true\n        elseif inQuestion && !startswith(line, \" \")\n            question *= line.data\n        elseif inAnswer && !startswith(line, \" \")\n            answer *= line.data\n        end\n    end\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nIn this function, we iterate over each line of the input markdown string. If a line starts with \"# Question\", we set `inQuestion` to true and start collecting question text. Similarly if it starts with \"# Answer\", we switch to collecting answer text. Any other lines that are not indented by a space and appear when we're collecting question or answer text are collected accordingly.\n\nYou can call the function with your markdown string as argument, like this:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question 1\nWhat is the capital of France?\n# Answer 1\nParis\n\"\"\"\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md)) # prints (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"Paris\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,336],"elapsed":2.942181051,"_type":"aimessage"}]
