If either position is not found (meaning the markdown format isn't recognized), it throws an error. Then, it extracts the text from each section and returns them as a tuple. The `strip` function removes any leading spaces or newlines from the extracted text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,242],"elapsed":2.147620887,"_type":"aimessage"}]
