If it encounters a line that starts with `# Question`, it knows to begin collecting text for the question. If it encounters a line starting with `# Answer`, it begins collecting text for the answer. It ignores any lines that come after these two markers, and once it reaches the end of either section, it stops collecting. The function returns a tuple of stripped strings representing the question and answer.\n\nNote: This function assumes that your markdown sections always start with `#` followed by \"Question\" or \"Answer\", and that there are no other lines starting with these prefixes in between your desired sections. If this is not the case, you would need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,346],"elapsed":3.072523156,"_type":"aimessage"}]
