Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can do this:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            continue\n        end\n        if startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        if in_question && !isempty(strip(line))\n            question *= line[3:end] # strip '# ' from the start of each line\n        elseif in_answer && !isempty(strip(line))\n            answer *= line[3:end] # strip '# ' from the start of each line\n        end\n    end\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nYou can then call this function with your markdown string as an argument, like so:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nThis is my question?\n\n# Answer\nYes, you're right. The answer is correct!\n\"\"\"\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md))\n```\n\nThis function `q_and_a_extractor` goes through each line of the markdown string and checks if it starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`. If so, it sets a flag to indicate that section. Then, for every subsequent line, it appends the text to the appropriate variable (`question` or `answer`), stripping any leading spaces or newlines from the text before adding it. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the formatted question and answer strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,387],"elapsed":3.449929761,"_type":"aimessage"}]
