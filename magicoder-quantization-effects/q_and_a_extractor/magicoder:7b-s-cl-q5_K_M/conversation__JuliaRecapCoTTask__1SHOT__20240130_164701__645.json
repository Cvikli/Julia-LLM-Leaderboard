[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can solve this problem using Julia:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestion = false\n    inAnswer = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestion = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inQuestion = false\n            inAnswer = true\n        end\n        \n        if inQuestion\n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif inAnswer\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function goes line by line through the `md` string and identifies whether it's a question or an answer section. It then adds the stripped text of that line to the appropriate variable. When it encounters a `# Question` or `# Answer`, it toggles between the two states.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n    # Question\n        What is your favorite programming language?\n    \n    # Answer\n        My favorite programming language is Julia! \n\"\"\"\nq_and_a_extractor(md)\n```\nThis will return `(\"What is your favorite programming language?\", \"My favorite programming language is Julia!\")`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,318],"elapsed":2.865996228,"_type":"aimessage"}]
