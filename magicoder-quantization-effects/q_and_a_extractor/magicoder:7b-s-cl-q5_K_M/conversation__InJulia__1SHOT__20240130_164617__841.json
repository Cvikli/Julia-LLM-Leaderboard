[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example implementation of `q_and_a_extractor` function:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n') # splitting markdown into lines\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    q_flag = false \n    a_flag = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            q_flag = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\") && !q_flag\n            a_flag = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if q_flag && !a_flag \n            question *= line\n        elseif a_flag\n            answer *= line\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer)) # removing leading spaces and newlines from the text using `strip` function\nend\n```\nThis code works by iterating over each line in the markdown string. If a line starts with `# Question`, it sets the flag for question extraction to true, and continues to next iteration if this is detected. Similarly, if a line starts with `# Answer` but not within a question section, it sets the flag for answer extraction to true. For lines that are either in a question or an answer section, it appends the line content to the respective variable (after stripping leading spaces and newline characters).\n\nNote: This function assumes that questions and answers are delimited by `# Question` and `# Answer`, and these keywords don't occur elsewhere in the markdown. If your input format can vary or is more complex, you might need a more sophisticated solution.","status":200,"tokens":[0,374],"elapsed":3.275389767,"_type":"aimessage"}]
