[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it sets the corresponding flag to true and continues to the next line without processing. Otherwise, if both flags are true (meaning we're in a question or an answer), it strips any leading spaces and newlines from the line and assigns it to the appropriate variable (question or answer). When all lines have been processed, it returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer.\n  \nNote that this function assumes each `# Question` section is followed by exactly one `# Answer` section. If there are situations where the sections could be out of order or missing, additional logic would need to be added to handle those cases properly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,360],"elapsed":3.250592439,"_type":"aimessage"}]
