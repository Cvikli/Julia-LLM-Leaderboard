[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how this could be done:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")  # Split the markdown string into lines\n    current_section = \"None\"\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            current_section = \"Question\"\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            current_section = \"Answer\"\n        elseif current_section == \"Question\"\n            question *= strip(line)  # Add line to question after stripping leading spaces and newlines\n        elseif current_section == \"Answer\"\n            answer *= strip(line)  # Add line to answer after stripping leading spaces and newlines\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nThis function splits the input markdown string into lines and checks each one for whether it is a question or an answer section. It then adds that line of text to either the question or the answer, stripping any leading spaces or newlines in the process. Finally, it returns the question and answer as a tuple.\n\nYou can call this function with the markdown string like:\n```julia\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md_text))\n```\nThis will print out `(What is the capital of France?, The capital of France is Paris.)`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,363],"elapsed":4.090766684,"_type":"aimessage"}]
