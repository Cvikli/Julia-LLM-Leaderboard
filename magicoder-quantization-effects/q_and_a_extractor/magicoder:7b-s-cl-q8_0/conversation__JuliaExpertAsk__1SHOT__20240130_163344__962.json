Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

The `re.DOTALL` flag tells python to match any character including newline characters. \n\nHere is an example usage:\n\n```python\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nHow to solve this problem?\n\n# Answer\nYou can use Julia's built-in functions...\n\"\"\"\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(md))  # output: ('How to solve this problem?', 'You can use Julia\\'s built-in functions...')\n```\n\nIn the example, `strip()` is used to remove any leading spaces and newline characters. The function returns a tuple containing the question and answer text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,270],"elapsed":3.018461134,"_type":"aimessage"}]
