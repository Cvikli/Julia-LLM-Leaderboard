Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can do this using Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = ''\n    answer = ''\n    \n    lines = md.split('\\n')\n    \n    for i in range(len(lines)):\n        if 'Question' in lines[i]:\n            start_index = i + 1\n            while not re.match('^#', lines[start_index]):\n                question += ''.join(re.sub('\\s+',' ', lines[start_index].strip())) + '\\n'\n                start_index += 1\n        \n        if 'Answer' in lines[i]:\n            start_index = i + 1\n            while not re.match('^#', lines[start_index]):\n                answer += ''.join(re.sub('\\s+',' ', lines[start_index].strip())) + '\\n'\n                start_index += 1\n    \n    return (question.strip(), answer.strip())\n```\nThis function works by splitting the markdown text `md` into separate lines and iterating over each line to find any line containing 'Question' or 'Answer'. If a match is found, it starts reading in subsequent lines until a new section (determined by a line starting with '#') is encountered. The extracted text is then joined together without leading spaces or newline characters and returned as a tuple of the question and answer.\n\nPlease note that the function assumes that each 'Question' and 'Answer' section is separated from other sections by at least one '#'. It will return empty strings if either the Question or Answer cannot be found in the markdown text. If the format of your markdown varies, you may need to adjust this code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,394],"elapsed":4.417893169,"_type":"aimessage"}]
