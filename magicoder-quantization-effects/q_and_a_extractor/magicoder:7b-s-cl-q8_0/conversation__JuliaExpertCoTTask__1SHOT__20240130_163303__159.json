Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can write a function to achieve this:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(strip(md), \"\\n\")\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    section = \"\"\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            section = \"question\"\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            section = \"answer\"\n        elseif section == \"question\" && !isempty(line)\n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif section == \"answer\" && !isempty(line)\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function splits the markdown into lines and iterates over each line. If a line starts with \"# Question\", it switches to extracting question text. If a line starts with \"# Answer\", it switches to extracting answer text. Any non-empty lines in these sections are appended to `question` or `answer`. Finally, it returns the extracted (question, answer) tuple.\n\nThis code will strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text before returning it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,277],"elapsed":3.11251434,"_type":"aimessage"}]
