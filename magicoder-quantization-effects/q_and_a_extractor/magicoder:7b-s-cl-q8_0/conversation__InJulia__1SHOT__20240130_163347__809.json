[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you might write such a function using Julia's built-in string processing capabilities:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_question \n            question *= line[end-1:end]\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= line[end-1:end]\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function splits the markdown into lines, then checks each line to see if it starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If so, it flips a flag for whether we are currently inside that section. If not, and we're in one of those sections, it appends the line to the corresponding string (after stripping leading spaces). Finally, it returns the question and answer strings after removing any trailing whitespace with `strip`.\n\nNote: This function assumes that a \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\" line is only used once per section. If this might not be true in your actual input, you would need to adjust the code appropriately.","status":200,"tokens":[98,340],"elapsed":3.837012679,"_type":"aimessage"}]
