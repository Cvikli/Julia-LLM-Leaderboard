[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is one way you could approach this problem using regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = match(r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n# Answer\", md, re\"\") |> x -> x.captures[1] |> strip\n    answer   = match(r\"# Answer\\n(.*?)\\n# End of Answer\", md, re\"\") |> x -> x.captures[1] |> strip\n    \n    if question == nothing || answer == nothing\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Markdown does not contain a Question or an Answer section.\"))\n    end\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nIn the above function, we use regex to match the patterns of `Question` and `Answer` in the markdown text. The `match()` function returns a Match object if it finds a match, or nothing if not. We then use indexing on this object (`captures[1]`) to get the first (and only) captured group from our regex pattern, which is where our question/answer content will be.\n\nWe strip leading spaces and newlines using `strip()`. Note that `strip()` removes both leading and trailing whitespaces but doesn't affect internal spaces or newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,284],"elapsed":3.18137598,"_type":"aimessage"}]
