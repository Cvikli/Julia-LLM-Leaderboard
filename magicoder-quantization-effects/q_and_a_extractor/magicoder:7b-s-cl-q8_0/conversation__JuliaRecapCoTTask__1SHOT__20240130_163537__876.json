[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use Julia's powerful string manipulation functions to achieve this task. Here is an example of how you can solve this:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Find the position of the question and answer in the markdown\n    question_start = findfirst(x -> startswith(x, \"# Question\"), split(md, '\\n'))\n    answer_start = findfirst(x -> startswith(x, \"# Answer\"), split(md, '\\n'))\n    \n    # If there is no question or answer, return an empty string for both\n    if isnothing(question_start) || isnothing(answer_start)\n        return (\"\", \"\")\n    end\n\n    # Extract the text after the question and answer markers\n    question = split(md, '\\n')[question_start + 1:answer_start - 1] |> join |> strip\n    answer = split(md, '\\n')[answer_start + 1 : end] |> join |> strip\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the markdown into lines and finding the first line starting with \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\". It then extracts all text in between these lines.\n\nPlease replace `{{instructions}}` with actual instructions in your prompt as it would depend on specific requirements of the task at hand.","status":200,"tokens":[0,314],"elapsed":3.577501237,"_type":"aimessage"}]
