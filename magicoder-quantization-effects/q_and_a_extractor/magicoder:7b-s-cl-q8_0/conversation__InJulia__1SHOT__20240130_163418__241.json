[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could solve this problem using Julia programming language:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\") \n            question *= strip(replace(line[12:end], ' ' => \"\"))\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\") \n            answer *= strip(replace(line[10:end], ' ' => \"\"))\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function splits the markdown text into lines and then loops through each line. If a line starts with `# Question`, it will add the part after `# Question` to `question` variable after removing spaces and newlines using string functions. Similar processing is done for lines starting with `# Answer`.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes your markdown text always contains exactly one question and one answer, and that there are no other sections or headers present in the text. If you might have multiple questions and answers, or other sections, you would need a different approach (like using a parser for Markdown).","status":200,"tokens":[0,276],"elapsed":3.079095309,"_type":"aimessage"}]
