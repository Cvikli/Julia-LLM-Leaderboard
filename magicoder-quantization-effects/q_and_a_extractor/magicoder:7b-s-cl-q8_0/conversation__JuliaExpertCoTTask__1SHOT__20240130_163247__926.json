If a line starts with `# Question`, it sets `question` to that line without leading spaces, if a line starts with `# Answer`, it joins all the lines in `answer` (with no leading spaces) and returns them as a tuple. It also checks for any remaining content after `# Question` but before `# Answer`. If neither a question nor an answer section is found, it returns None.","status":200,"tokens":[0,284],"elapsed":3.212165541,"_type":"aimessage"}]
