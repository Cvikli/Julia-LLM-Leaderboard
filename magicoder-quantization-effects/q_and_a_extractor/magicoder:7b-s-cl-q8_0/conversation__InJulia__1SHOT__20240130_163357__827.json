[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple solution using the Regex package in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Text\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = matchall(\"(?<=# Question\\\\n).*\", md)\n    answer = matchall(\"(?<=# Answer\\\\n).*\", md)\n    \n    # Remove leading spaces and newlines \n    question = strip.(split(question, \"\\n\"))\n    answer = strip.(split(answer, \"\\n\"))\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by using regular expressions to find all lines that start with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". `matchall` returns a list of all matches as strings. We then split those strings on the newline character (\\n), and strip any leading spaces from each line. Finally we return them in a tuple.\nPlease note that this solution assumes that there is only one question and answer per markdown file, and does not account for multiple questions or answers per file.","status":200,"tokens":[0,219],"elapsed":2.441525863,"_type":"aimessage"}]
