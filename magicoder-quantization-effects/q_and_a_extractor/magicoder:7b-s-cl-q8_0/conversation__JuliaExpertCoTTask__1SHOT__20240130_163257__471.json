Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here's an implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\", keepempty=false)\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question = lstrip(rstrip(line[13:end]))  # remove the leading spaces and newline characters\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer = lstrip(rstrip(line[10:end]))  \n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThe `q_and_a_extractor` function works by splitting the input string into an array of lines. It then iterates through each line and checks if it starts with either \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If so, it extracts the relevant text (excluding the leading hashes and spaces) and stores it in `question` or `answer`, respectively.\n\nThen it returns a tuple containing the question and answer.\n\nTesting: \n```julia\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n# Answer\\nThe capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\nThis should return `(What is the capital of France?, The capital of France is Paris.)`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,313],"elapsed":3.531207541,"_type":"aimessage"}]
