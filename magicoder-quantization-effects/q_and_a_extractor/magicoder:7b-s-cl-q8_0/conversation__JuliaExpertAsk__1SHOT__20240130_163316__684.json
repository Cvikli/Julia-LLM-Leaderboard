Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution for your problem:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    # Find all sections starting with '# Question' and '# Answer'\n    question = re.findall(r'\\n# Question(.*?)(?=\\n# |$)', md, re.DOTALL)\n    answer = re.findall(r'\\n# Answer(.*?)(?=\\n# |$)', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # Strip leading spaces and newlines from the sections\n    question = [re.sub(r'^[\\s\\n]+|[\\s\\n]+$', '', q.strip()) for q in question]\n    answer = [re.sub(r'^[\\s\\n]+|[\\s\\n]+$', '', a.strip()) for a in answer]\n    \n    # Return the sections as a tuple\n    return (question,answer)\n```\n\nThis function uses Python's `re` module to search for the desired sections using regular expressions. It then strips leading spaces and newlines from each section before returning them as a tuple. If no question or answer is found in the text, an empty list will be returned for that part of the tuple.\n\nNote: This function assumes that there are no other lines starting with '#' except those starting 'Question' or 'Answer'.  Also, it does not handle nested sections well.","status":200,"tokens":[0,319],"elapsed":3.608947234,"_type":"aimessage"}]
