[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can use regular expressions to find these sections in the markdown and then extract the text between them. Here is how you might implement this function:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Iterators: filter\nimport Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    \n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_question && !startswith(line, \"## \")\n            question *= strip(Markdown.plaintext(line))\n        elseif in_answer && !startswith(line, \"## \")\n            answer *= strip(Markdown.plaintext(line))\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each line of the markdown string and checking if it represents a new question or an answer. When it encounters such lines, it switches into capturing mode for that section until it sees another section indicator or the end of the file. It then concatenates all non-section lines to the appropriate variable, stripping leading spaces and newlines as necessary.\n\nThis function uses the `Markdown` package which is part of Julia's standard library (you don't need to install this separately). The `plaintext` function here extracts the text from any markdown elements in the line, converting them into a simple string without any formatting or special characters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,394],"elapsed":4.528772954,"_type":"aimessage"}]
