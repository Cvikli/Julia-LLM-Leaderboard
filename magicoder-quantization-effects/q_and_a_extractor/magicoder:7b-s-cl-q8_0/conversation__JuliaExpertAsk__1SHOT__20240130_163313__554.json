Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can approach this task using Python programming language:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    # Using regular expressions to find sections\n    question = re.search(r'\\n# Question\\n(.+?)(?=\\n# Answer|\\Z)', md, re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE).group(1)\n    answer = re.search(r'\\n# Answer\\n(.+?)(?=\\n#|$)', md, re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE).group(1)\n    \n    # Strip leading spaces and newlines\n    question = question.strip()\n    answer = answer.strip()\n    \n    return (question,answer)\n```\nThis function uses two regular expressions to find the text sections Question and Answer. The `re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE` flags are used to make dot `.` match any character at all, including a newline, and to make `^` and `$` match the start and end of any line (not just the start or end of the string).\n\nThe group(1) method is called on each result to get the first matching group. The .+? operator matches anything but reluctantly (minimum number of times), and (?=...) is a positive lookahead assertion that makes sure we are followed by something, without consuming it.\n\nFinally, `strip()` function is used to remove any leading spaces or newlines from the text sections.","status":200,"tokens":[0,341],"elapsed":3.863106058,"_type":"aimessage"}]
