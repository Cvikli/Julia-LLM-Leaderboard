Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I can solve this problem using Python programming language. Here is the function definition:\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = re.findall(r'# Question(.*?)(?=\\n\\n|\\Z)', md, re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE)\n    answer = re.findall(r'# Answer(.*?)(?=\\n\\n|\\Z)', md, re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE)\n    \n    question = [re.sub('\\s*', '', q).strip() for q in question]\n    answer = [re.sub('\\s*', '', a).strip() for a in answer]\n    \n    return (question[0],answer[0]) if question and answer else (None, None)  # Return tuple of extracted questions and answers\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to find the sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`. The `re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE` flags are used in the `findall` method to make dot (.) match all characters, including newlines and make the start/end of a string match at newline boundaries.\n\nThen, using list comprehension and `sub`, we strip any leading spaces or newlines from the extracted text. Finally, if question and answer both exist in the markdown string, they will be returned as a tuple `(question,answer)`, otherwise `(None, None)`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,327],"elapsed":3.657043754,"_type":"aimessage"}]
