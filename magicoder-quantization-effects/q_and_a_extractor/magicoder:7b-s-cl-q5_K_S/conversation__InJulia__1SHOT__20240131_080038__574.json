If those state variables are `true` and a non-empty line is encountered, it appends the content of the line to the question or answer respectively.\n\nAfter going through all lines, it returns the extracted question and answer stripped of leading spaces and newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,296],"elapsed":2.540070264,"_type":"aimessage"}]
