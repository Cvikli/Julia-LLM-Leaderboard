Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple solution using regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = match(r\"# Question\\n(.*?)(?=\\n## Answer)\", md, dotall=true)[1]\n    answer = match(r\"## Answer\\n(.*?)(?=\\n#)\", md, dotall=true)[1]\n    \n    # strip leading spaces and newlines\n    question = replace(question, r\"^[ \\t]*\\n\" => \"\")\n    answer = replace(answer, r\"^[ \\t]*\\n\" => \"\")\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to match the sections of interest. The `match` function returns a tuple containing all matches found in the string. The `dotall=true` argument allows for matching across multiple lines. The `replace` function is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from each section. Finally, the `strip` function is used to remove any trailing whitespace.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nThis is a question?\n## Answer\nThis is an answer!\n\"\"\"\nq_and_a_extractor(md)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,298],"elapsed":2.56189534,"_type":"aimessage"}]
