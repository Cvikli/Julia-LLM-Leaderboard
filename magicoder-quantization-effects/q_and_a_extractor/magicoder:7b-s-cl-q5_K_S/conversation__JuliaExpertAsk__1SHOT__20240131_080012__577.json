Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple Python function that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = None\n    answer = None\n    \n    lines = md.split('\\n')\n    for i in range(len(lines)):\n        if '# Question' in lines[i]:\n            question = ''\n            j = i + 1\n            while not ('# Answer' in lines[j] or j == len(lines) - 1):\n                question += re.sub('^ *', '', lines[j]) + '\\n'\n                j += 1\n        elif '# Answer' in lines[i]:\n            answer = ''\n            j = i + 1\n            while not (j == len(lines) - 1 or '##' in lines[j]):\n                answer += re.sub('^ *', '', lines[j]) + '\\n'\n                j += 1\n            \n    return question, answer\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the markdown text into individual lines and iterating over each line. When it encounters a line that starts with `# Question`, it knows to start collecting the question text. Similarly, when it encounters a line that starts with `# Answer`, it knows to start collecting the answer text. It continues collecting these texts until it encounters another section header (indicated by `##`) or reaches the end of the markdown text.\n\nThe regular expression `'^ *'` is used to remove any leading spaces from each line before adding them to the question or answer strings.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there will be exactly one `# Question` and one `# Answer` in the markdown text, and that these sections won't be nested (i.e., an `# Answer` section cannot appear within a `# Question` section). If your markdown structure can vary significantly from this, you may need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,430],"elapsed":3.737147889,"_type":"aimessage"}]
