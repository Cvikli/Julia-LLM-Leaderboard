It then iterates over each line and checks if it's a line starting a new Question or Answer section. When it finds such a line, it toggles the `inQuestionSection` and `inAnswerSection` flags and continues to the next line. If a line is part of a Question or Answer section, it appends the stripped (leading spaces removed) version of that line to the appropriate string variable (`question` for question lines, `answer` for answer lines).\n\nFinally, it returns a tuple with both the question and answer strings. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is always an Answer section following a Question section (it wouldn't make sense to have only a Question section in markdown), and also that each line of a section (except for the first one) has at least one non-space character after stripping leading spaces.","status":200,"tokens":[0,404],"elapsed":3.506448355,"_type":"aimessage"}]
