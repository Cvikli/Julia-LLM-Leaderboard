If the line starts with \"# Question\", it adds the rest of the line to question after stripping the leading spaces. Similarly for \"# Answer\". After going through all the lines, it returns a tuple with question and answer. \n\nYou can test this function like:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is your name?\n# Answer\nJohn Doe\n\"\"\"\nq_and_a_extractor(md)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,267],"elapsed":2.28672661,"_type":"aimessage"}]
