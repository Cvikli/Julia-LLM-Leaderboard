It iterates over these sections, strips leading spaces and newlines from each section, and stores them in `question` and `answer`. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the question and answer.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is only one `# Question` or `# Answer` per markdown text. If your markdown texts have multiple of these sections, you may need to modify the function to handle them appropriately.","status":200,"tokens":[0,329],"elapsed":2.794211059,"_type":"aimessage"}]
