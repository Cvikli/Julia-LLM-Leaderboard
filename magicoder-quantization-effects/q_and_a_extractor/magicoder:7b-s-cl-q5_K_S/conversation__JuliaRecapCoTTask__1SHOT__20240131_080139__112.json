[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might implement this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestionSection = false\n    inAnswerSection = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestionSection = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inQuestionSection = false\n            inAnswerSection = true\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if inQuestionSection && !isempty(strip(line))\n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif inAnswerSection && !isempty(strip(line))\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nIn this function, we split the markdown text into lines and iterate over each line. If a line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", we set our respective flags to true and continue to the next line. If these flags are true and we encounter a non-empty line, we append it to the question/answer string after stripping leading spaces and newlines. Finally, we return the question and answer as a tuple.\n\nRemember that this function assumes that each section (question or answer) is on its own line with no other text on those lines. If your markdown has additional formatting (e.g., multiple paragraphs within a question/answer), you'll need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,348],"elapsed":3.161880721,"_type":"aimessage"}]
