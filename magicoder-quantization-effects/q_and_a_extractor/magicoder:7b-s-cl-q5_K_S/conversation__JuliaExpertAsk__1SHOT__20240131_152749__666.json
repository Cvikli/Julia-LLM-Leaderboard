Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can implement this function using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n        elseif in_question && !startswith(line, \" \")\n            question *= line\n        elseif in_answer && !startswith(line, \" \")\n            answer *= line\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the markdown string into lines and then iterating through these lines. It checks each line to see if it starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`, and if so, toggles a flag accordingly. If the line is not indented (i.e., does not start with a space), it appends this line to either the question or answer text depending on which section we're currently in. Finally, it returns a tuple of the stripped question and answer texts. \n\nNote: This function assumes that there will be no more than one `# Question` or `# Answer` per markdown section. If you have multiple sections with these headers, you may need to adjust this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,349],"elapsed":2.965035071,"_type":"aimessage"}]
