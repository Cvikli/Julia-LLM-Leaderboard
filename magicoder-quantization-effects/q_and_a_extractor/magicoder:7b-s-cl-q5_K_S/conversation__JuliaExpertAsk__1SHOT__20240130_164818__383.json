[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise.

Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\") \n            in_question = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\") \n            in_question = false\n        elseif in_question && !isempty(strip(line))\n            question *= strip(line) * \"\\n\"\n        elseif !in_question && !isempty(strip(line))\n            answer *= strip(line) * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    return (trim(question), trim(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the input string into lines and iterating over each line. If a line starts with `# Question`, it switches to recording question text (`in_question` = true). If a line starts with `# Answer`, it switches to recording answer text (`in_question` = false). It also checks whether `in_question` is true while trimming whitespace from the ends of lines that are not empty and appending them to either the question or answer strings. The resulting strings are returned as a tuple.\n  \nPlease note that this function assumes that `# Question` and `# Answer` are on their own lines, and that they are the only things in those lines. If there could be other text before `# Question` or `# Answer`, you would need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,353],"elapsed":3.09015596,"_type":"aimessage"}]
