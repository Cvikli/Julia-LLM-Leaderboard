It returns a tuple of the first found question and answer, or `None` if no questions or answers are found. \n\nNote: This solution assumes that there is only one question and one answer in the markdown string. If there can be multiple questions/answers, you would need to modify this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[128,306],"elapsed":2.658676324,"_type":"aimessage"}]
