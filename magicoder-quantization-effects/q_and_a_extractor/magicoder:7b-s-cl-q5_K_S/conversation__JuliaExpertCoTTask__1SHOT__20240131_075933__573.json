If a line starts with \"# Question\", it extracts the text following this string and removes leading spaces. Similarly, if a line starts with \"# Answer\", it extracts the text following this string and removes leading spaces. It returns these two strings as a tuple once both have been found. If either question or answer is not found, it returns an empty string for that field.","status":200,"tokens":[0,260],"elapsed":2.302963646,"_type":"aimessage"}]
