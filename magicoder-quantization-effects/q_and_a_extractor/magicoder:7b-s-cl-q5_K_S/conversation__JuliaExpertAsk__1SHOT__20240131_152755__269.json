If it encounters a line starting with \"# Question\", it sets `inQuestionSection` to true, if it encounters a line starting with \"# Answer\", it sets `inAnswerSection` to true. If it is currently in the question section and encounters a non-empty line, it appends the line to the question string (without the leading spaces or newline characters). Similarly, if it is currently in the answer section and encounters a non-empty line, it appends the line to the answer string. Finally, it returns the stripped versions of the question and answer strings as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,356],"elapsed":3.037004142,"_type":"aimessage"}]
