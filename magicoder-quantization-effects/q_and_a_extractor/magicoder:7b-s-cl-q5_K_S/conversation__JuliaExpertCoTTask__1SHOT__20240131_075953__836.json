The `re.DOTALL` flag makes sure that `.` matches any character, including newlines. \n\nThe extracted text is then stripped of leading spaces and newlines using the `strip()` method. The function returns a tuple containing the question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,224],"elapsed":1.936232753,"_type":"aimessage"}]
