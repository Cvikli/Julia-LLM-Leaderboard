Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can implement this function using Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = None\n    answer = None\n    \n    lines = md.split('\\n')\n    for i, line in enumerate(lines):\n        if line.strip().startswith('# Question'):\n            question = ''\n            while not lines[i+1].strip().startswith('# Answer'):\n                question += lines[i+1].lstrip(' #').strip() + '\\n'\n                i += 1\n            question = question.rstrip('\\n')\n        elif line.strip().startswith('# Answer'):\n            answer = ''\n            while not (lines[i+1].strip().startswith('# Question') or lines[i+1] == ''):\n                answer += lines[i+1].lstrip(' #').strip() + '\\n'\n                i += 1\n            answer = answer.rstrip('\\n')\n    \n    return (question,answer) if question and answer else None\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the markdown text into lines and iterating over them. When it finds a line that starts with `# Question`, it continues to accumulate lines until it encounters a line starting with `# Answer`. The same process is done for the answer section. It then returns a tuple of the question and answer, or `None` if either part was not found.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that each question/answer pair is separated by at least one empty line in the markdown text. If there are multiple questions/answers in the same file, it will only return the last pair.","status":200,"tokens":[0,371],"elapsed":3.230107805,"_type":"aimessage"}]
