It returns the question and answer in a tuple. If there is no match for either \"Question\" or \"Answer\", it will return \"No question or answer found.\"\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that your markdown text only contains one \"# Question\" section and one \"# Answer\" section.","status":200,"tokens":[128,288],"elapsed":2.500546917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
