[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might do this using Julia's Markdown parsing capabilities:\n\n```julia\nusing Documenter\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(strip(md), '\\n')\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n        elseif in_question && !isempty(line)\n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif !in_question && !isempty(line)\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function splits the input markdown text into lines and iterates over each line. If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\", it switches to collecting the question. If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Answer\", it switches to collecting the answer. Any other lines are added to the current collection (question or answer). The `strip` function is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from each collected string, before they're concatenated together.","status":200,"tokens":[0,284],"elapsed":2.402059966,"_type":"aimessage"}]
