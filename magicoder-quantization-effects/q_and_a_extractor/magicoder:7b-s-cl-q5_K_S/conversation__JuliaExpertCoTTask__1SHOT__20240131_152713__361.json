Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that accomplishes this task in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n        end\n        if in_question && !isempty(strip(line))\n            question *= strip(line) * \"\\n\"\n        elseif in_answer && !isempty(strip(line))\n            answer *= strip(line) * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function splits the input markdown string into lines and then goes through each line. If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\", it sets `in_question` to true and if it finds a line starting with \"# Answer\", it sets `in_answer` to true. It also checks whether the current line is not empty (i.e., contains some characters other than spaces) before adding it to the question or answer string.\n\nYou can test this function using your provided data:\n```julia\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n# Answer\\nThe capital of France is Paris.\"))\n```\nThis should print `(question = \"What is the capital of France?\", answer = \"The capital of France is Paris.\")`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,375],"elapsed":3.235844227,"_type":"aimessage"}]
