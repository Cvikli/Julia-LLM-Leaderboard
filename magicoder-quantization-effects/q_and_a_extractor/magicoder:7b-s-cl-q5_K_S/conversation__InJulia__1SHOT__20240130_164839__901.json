[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might write this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    \n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    current_section = \"\"\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            current_section = \"question\"\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            current_section = \"answer\"\n        elseif current_section == \"question\"\n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif current_section == \"answer\"\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function splits the input `md` string into lines. It then iterates through each line to identify whether it is a part of question or answer section based on its starting character sequence. If it is in a question section, it appends stripped content to `question`. Similarly if it encounters an Answer section, it starts adding contents to the `answer` variable. After going through all lines, function returns both the extracted question and answer as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[98,270],"elapsed":2.34421877,"_type":"aimessage"}]
