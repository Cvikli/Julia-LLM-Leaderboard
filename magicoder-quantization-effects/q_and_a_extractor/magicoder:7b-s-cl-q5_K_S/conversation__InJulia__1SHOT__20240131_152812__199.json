If either section doesn't exist, it returns an empty tuple. \n\nIt then extracts the text between these sections (after stripping any leading spaces or newlines) and returns them as a tuple.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is only one question and answer in the markdown text, and that they are separated by at least one line of whitespace. If there may be more than one question/answer pair, or if they can be interspersed with other text, you'll need a different approach.","status":200,"tokens":[0,459],"elapsed":3.902833857,"_type":"aimessage"}]
