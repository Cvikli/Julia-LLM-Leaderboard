[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem, you can use the `eachline` function to iterate over each line of the markdown text. You can then check if a line starts with either `# Question` or `# Answer`. If it does, store the subsequent lines in a variable until you encounter another section heading. Here is an example implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    current_section = nothing\n\n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        stripped_line = strip(line)\n        \n        if startswith(stripped_line, \"# Question\")\n            current_section = :question\n        elseif startswith(stripped_line, \"# Answer\")\n            current_section = :answer\n        elseif current_section !== nothing && !isempty(stripped_line)\n            if current_section == :question\n                question *= stripped_line\n            elseif current_section == :answer\n                answer *= stripped_line\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function goes through each line of the markdown text, and if a line starts with either \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it starts storing subsequent lines in the corresponding variable (`question` or `answer`). It stops when it encounters another section heading. It also strips any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text before returning it as a tuple.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n    # Question\n        What is your name?\n    # Answer\n        My name is Julia.\n    \"\"\"\nq_and_a_extractor(md)  # returns (\"What is your name?\", \"My name is Julia.\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[11,412],"elapsed":3.607891412,"_type":"aimessage"}]
