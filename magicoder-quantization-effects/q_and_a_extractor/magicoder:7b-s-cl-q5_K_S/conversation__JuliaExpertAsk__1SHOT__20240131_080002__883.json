It then strips any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text using regular expressions.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is only one question and answer in the markdown text. If there are multiple questions/answers, you would need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,286],"elapsed":2.468308083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
