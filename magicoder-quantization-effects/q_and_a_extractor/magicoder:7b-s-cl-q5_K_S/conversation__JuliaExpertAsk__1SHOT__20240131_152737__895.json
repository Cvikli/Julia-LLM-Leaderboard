If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it changes the corresponding boolean variable to `true` and continues processing the next lines until it finds another section header. Any subsequent lines are appended to the question/answer variable after removing any leading spaces.\n\nFinally, it returns the extracted question and answer stripped of leading spaces.","status":200,"tokens":[0,301],"elapsed":2.557573447,"_type":"aimessage"}]
