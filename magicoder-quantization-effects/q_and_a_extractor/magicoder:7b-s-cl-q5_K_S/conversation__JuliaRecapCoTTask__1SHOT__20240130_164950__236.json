[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem using regular expressions in Julia to match the pattern of the question and answer sections. Here's a simple implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    pattern = r\"^# Question(.*?)^# Answer(.*?)\"s\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(pattern, md, anchors=true))\n\n    if isempty(matches)\n        return (\"\", \"\")\n    end\n\n    question = strip(join(matches[1].captures[1]))\n    answer = strip(join(matches[1].captures[2]))\n    \n    (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThe pattern `^# Question(.*?)^# Answer(.*?)` is looking for the strings \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\", followed by anything (`.*?`) until the next line beginning with either of these two strings. This is a bit loose, so if your markdown has other possible formats you might need to adjust it accordingly.\n\nThis function will return an empty string for either the question or the answer if there is no corresponding match in the input string. \n\nYou can call this function with a markdown-formatted text:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question 1\n\nThis is the first question.\n\n# Answer 1\n\nThis is the first answer.\n\n# Question 2\n\nThis is the second question.\n\n# Answer 2\n\nThis is the second answer.\n\"\"\"\n\nq_and_a_extractor(md)\n```\n\nIf you wish to include special instructions, pass them as a string to `instructions` variable and modify pattern accordingly:\n```julia\npattern = r\"^# Question(.*?)\\s*{{instructions}}.*?^# Answer(.*?)\"s\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,418],"elapsed":3.682334896,"_type":"aimessage"}]
