Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple Python solution using regular expressions:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = re.search(r'\\n# Question\\n(.*?)\\n', md, re.DOTALL)\n    answer = re.search(r'\\n# Answer\\n(.*?)\\n', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    if question and answer:\n        return (question.group(1).strip(), answer.group(1).strip())\n    else:\n        return (\"No question or answer found\", \"\")\n```\n\nThis function uses the `re` module to search for the sections of the markdown text. The regular expressions `\\n# Question\\n(.*?)\\n` and `\\n# Answer\\n(.*?)\\n` are used to find the lines starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively, and capture everything after them until the next line start with `#`.\n\nThe `re.DOTALL` flag makes `.` match any character including newline characters. The `group(1)` function is used to get the first (and only) matching group. Finally, `strip()` is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text. If no question or answer is found, an empty string is returned for the corresponding part of the tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,293],"elapsed":2.57375404,"_type":"aimessage"}]
