If it encounters a line starting with \"# Question\", it starts capturing the question. Similarly, if it encounters a line starting with \"# Answer\", it starts capturing the answer. It continues until it finds another section header or reaches the end of the markdown text. The captured sections are then stripped of leading spaces and newlines before being returned as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,291],"elapsed":2.518431498,"_type":"aimessage"}]
