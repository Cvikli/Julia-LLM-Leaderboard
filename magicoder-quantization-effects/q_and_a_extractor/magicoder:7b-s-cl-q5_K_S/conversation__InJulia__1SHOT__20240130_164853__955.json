[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might approach this task using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    \n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\") \n            in_question = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\") \n            in_answer = true\n        elseif in_question && !isempty(strip(line))\n            question *= strip(line) * \"\\n\"\n        elseif in_answer && !isempty(strip(line))\n            answer *= strip(line) * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes as input a string `md` that contains the markdown-formatted text. It splits this string into lines and then iterates through each line. If the line starts with \"# Question\", it sets a flag `in_question` to true and continues reading until it finds a line starting with `# Answer`, at which point it sets `in_answer` to true. If `in_question` is true and not empty, it adds the stripped line to the question string; similarly if `in_answer` is true and not empty, it adds the stripped line to the answer string.\n\nWhen both `# Question` and `# Answer` sections have been found, the function returns a tuple of strings `(question, answer)`.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that each section (question/answer) does not contain any other markdown syntax or special characters that would interfere with splitting the text. Also it doesn't handle nested sections or complex markdown formatting.","status":200,"tokens":[0,407],"elapsed":3.489020577,"_type":"aimessage"}]
