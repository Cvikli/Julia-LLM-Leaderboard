Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

Here is an example of how you could write such function:\n\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = match(r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n# Answer\", md, capture=true)[1]\n    answer   = match(r\"# Answer\\n(.*?)\\n## Next\", md, capture=true)[1]\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function uses a regular expression to find the text between `# Question` and `# Answer`, and then removes any leading or trailing spaces. Note that this is assuming you want to stop at `## Next`. If it's different in your markdown, adjust the regex accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,179],"elapsed":1.52672622,"_type":"aimessage"}]
