[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could implement this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_question && !isempty(line)\n            question *= line[2:end]\n        elseif in_answer && !isempty(line)\n            answer *= line[2:end]\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function splits the input markdown string into lines and iterates over each line. If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\", it sets `in_question` to true and continues to the next line. Similarly, if it encounters a line that starts with \"# Answer\", it sets `in_answer` to true and continues to the next line.\n\nIf `in_question` is true and the current line is not empty (i.e., it's not just a newline), then it appends the content of the line to the question string after stripping any leading spaces. Similarly, if `in_answer` is true and the current line is not empty, it appends the content of the line to the answer string after stripping any leading spaces.\n\nFinally, it returns a tuple containing the cleaned-up question and answer strings.","status":200,"tokens":[98,390],"elapsed":3.393328272,"_type":"aimessage"}]
