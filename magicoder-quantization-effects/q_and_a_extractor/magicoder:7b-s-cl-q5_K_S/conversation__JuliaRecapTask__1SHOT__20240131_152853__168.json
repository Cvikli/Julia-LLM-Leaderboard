[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function to solve this problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestionSection = false\n    inAnswerSection = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestionSection = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inAnswerSection = true\n        elseif inQuestionSection && !startswith(line, \"## \")\n            question *= lstrip(line)\n        elseif inAnswerSection && !startswith(line, \"## \")\n            answer *= lstrip(line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nThis function splits the markdown text into lines and iterates over each line. If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\", it sets `inQuestionSection` to true. Similarly, if it encounters a line that starts with \"# Answer\", it sets `inAnswerSection` to true. If `inQuestionSection` is true and the current line does not start with \"## \", it appends the line to `question`. Likewise for `answer` and `inAnswerSection`. After going through all lines, it returns a tuple of `question` and `answer`.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the markdown text is formatted as described. If there are other formats possible or if the question and answer sections could be nested, more complex logic would be needed to handle those cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,352],"elapsed":3.068606813,"_type":"aimessage"}]
