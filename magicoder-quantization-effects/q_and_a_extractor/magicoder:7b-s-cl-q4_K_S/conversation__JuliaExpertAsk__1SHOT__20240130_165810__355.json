You're precise and answer only when you're confident in the high quality of your answer.","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Question\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Python function that does exactly what you described:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = False\n    in_answer = False\n    \n    lines = md.split(\"\\n\")\n    for line in lines:\n        if line.startswith(\"# Question\"):\n            in_question = True\n            continue\n            \n        if line.startswith(\"# Answer\"):\n            in_answer = True\n            continue\n        \n        if in_question and not in_answer:\n            question += \" \"+line.lstrip()\n        elif not in_question and in_answer:\n            answer += \" \"+line.lstrip()\n            \n    return (re.sub(\"^ +\", \"\", question), re.sub(\"^ +\", \"\", answer))\n```\n\nThis function goes through each line of the markdown text and checks if it is a start of a Question or Answer section. If so, it sets the respective boolean to True. If not, it checks which part of the document it currently is in (question or answer), strips leading whitespaces from each line using `lstrip()` and adds the line to the question or answer variable. After all lines are processed, the function returns a tuple with cleaned up question and answer texts.\n\nThe regular expression `\"^ +\"` matches any number of leading spaces at the beginning of a string (which we use to remove extra indentation), and `line.lstrip()` removes all characters from the left end of the line which are in the set of whitespace characters.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes your markdown text is formatted correctly, i.e., there's exactly one Question section followed by one Answer section. If your markdown files can have multiple sections or no sections at all, you would need a more sophisticated logic to handle those cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,419],"elapsed":3.30824113,"_type":"aimessage"}]
