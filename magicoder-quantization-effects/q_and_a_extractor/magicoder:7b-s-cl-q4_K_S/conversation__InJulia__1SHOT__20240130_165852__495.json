[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution written in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    \n    in_question = false\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\") \n            in_question = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n        elseif in_question\n            question *= strip(line)\n        end\n        \n        if !in_question\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the markdown text into lines and iterating over these. If a line indicates that we are entering or leaving a Question/Answer section (`# Question` or `# Answer`), it toggles a flag `in_question`. When in a Question section, it appends to `question`, otherwise it appends to `answer`. Any leading whitespace is removed using the `strip` function.\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes that each `# Question`/`# Answer` pair corresponds to a single question/answer and they are ordered correctly. If this might not be the case in your input, you'll need a more sophisticated parsing strategy.","status":200,"tokens":[0,302],"elapsed":2.338308933,"_type":"aimessage"}]
