[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem using the `Md` package to parse markdown:\n\n```julia\nusing Md\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    parsed = parse_markdown(md)\n    \n    question = nothing\n    answer = nothing\n    \n    for block in parsed.content\n        if typeof(block) == Div && startswith(first(block.content), \"# Question\") \n            question = strip(join(block.content[2:end]))\n        elseif typeof(block) == Div && startswith(first(block.content), \"# Answer\") \n            answer = strip(join(block.content[2:end]))\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return question, answer\nend\n```\n\nThis function will parse the markdown into blocks and then iterate over each block to identify if it is a `Div` (i.e., a section) with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If found, it will strip any leading spaces or newlines from the text within that div and store in the corresponding variable (`question` or `answer`).\n\nYou can call this function by passing your markdown string to it like so:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"## Question\nHow do you solve a problem?\n## Answer\nBy using logic, resources and creativity.\"\nq_and_a_extractor(md)\n```\nThis will return the question and answer as strings in a tuple. If there is no `# Question` or `# Answer` in the markdown, it will return `nothing` for that part of the tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,359],"elapsed":2.775830215,"_type":"aimessage"}]
