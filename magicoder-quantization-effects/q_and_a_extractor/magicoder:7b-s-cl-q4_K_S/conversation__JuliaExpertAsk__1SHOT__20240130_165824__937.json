Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

If no questions or answers are found it returns `None`.\n\nPlease note that the pattern used in this solution assumes that there is only one question and answer per document, as indicated by your description. If you need to handle multiple questions and answers per document, you should modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,256],"elapsed":1.992902719,"_type":"aimessage"}]
