Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem by using regular expressions (regex) to identify the sections and extracting the text. Here's a sample Python solution:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = re.findall('\\n# Question(.+?)\\n', md, re.DOTALL)[0].strip()\n    answer = re.findall('\\n# Answer(.+?)\\n', md, re.DOTALL)[0].strip()\n    \n    return (question,answer)\n```\n\nIn this function `q_and_a_extractor`, I'm using the `re` module to find all text between `# Question` and `# Answer`. The `.+?` part of the regular expression `.findall` method means \"match anything, but stop when you reach a newline\", which is necessary to avoid including extra newlines or white spaces. Then `.strip()` removes any leading spaces or newlines from the extracted text.\n\nThis function should work for most markdown-formatted texts that follow exactly this structure. However, please note that it may not work perfectly with all possible inputs since markdown syntax is not a strict format but more of a convention, and can vary in practice. So if you are dealing with complicated or less standardized markdown documents, the function might need to be adjusted accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[272,297],"elapsed":13.193771456,"_type":"aimessage"}]
