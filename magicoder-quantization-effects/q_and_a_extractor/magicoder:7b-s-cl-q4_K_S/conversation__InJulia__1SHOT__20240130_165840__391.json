[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might implement this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question_section = false\n    in_answer_section = false\n\n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question_section = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question_section = false\n            in_answer_section = true\n        end\n        \n        if in_question_section && !isempty(question)\n            question *= line[end-length(question)+2:end]\n        elseif in_answer_section && !isempty(answer)\n            answer *= line[end-length(answer)+1:end]\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function reads the markdown string line by line. If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\", it starts recording question text. If it sees a line that starts with \"# Answer\", it switches over to recording answer text. It then continues to record those texts until it encounters a line starting with either of these phrases again (indicating the end of one section).\n\nNote: This function assumes there is only one \"Answer\" following \"Question\". If you have multiple lines for each question and answer, you'll need to adjust the logic accordingly. \n\nAlso note that this will remove any leading spaces or newlines in your extracted text. The `strip()` function does exactly that.","status":200,"tokens":[0,373],"elapsed":2.88930688,"_type":"aimessage"}]
