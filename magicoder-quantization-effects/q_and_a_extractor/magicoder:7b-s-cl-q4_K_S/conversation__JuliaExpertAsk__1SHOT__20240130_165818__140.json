[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise.

Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of a function that can solve this problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestionSection = false\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line,\"# Question\")\n            inQuestionSection = true\n        elseif startswith(line,\"# Answer\")\n            inQuestionSection = false\n        elseif inQuestionSection\n            question *= strip(line)\n        else\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the markdown string into lines and then going through each line. When it encounters a line starting with `# Question`, it switches to `inQuestionSection` mode. It appends every subsequent line (until it encounters another `#` or it runs out of lines) to `question`. When it sees a line starting with `# Answer`, it stops appending lines to `question` and starts appending them to `answer`.\n\nThis solution assumes that there are exactly two sections, one for the question and one for the answer, each delimited by `# Question` and `# Answer` respectively. If your markdown has multiple questions or answers in different sections, you would need a more sophisticated approach.","status":200,"tokens":[0,308],"elapsed":2.38564629,"_type":"aimessage"}]
