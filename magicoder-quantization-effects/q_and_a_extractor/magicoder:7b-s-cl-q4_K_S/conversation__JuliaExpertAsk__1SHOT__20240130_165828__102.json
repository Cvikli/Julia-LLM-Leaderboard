If it does, we know that the following lines are part of the question (or answer) until a new section is reached. The stripping removes leading spaces and newlines from the text.\n\nPlease note: this function assumes that each `# Question` section ends with a blank line (i.e., no text after it), and likewise for `# Answer`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,312],"elapsed":2.42757553,"_type":"aimessage"}]
