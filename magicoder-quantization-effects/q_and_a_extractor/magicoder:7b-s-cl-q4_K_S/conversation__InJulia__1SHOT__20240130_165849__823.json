[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can achieve this using the `Merkle.jl` package:\n\n```julia\nusing Merkle # This package allows you to parse markdown files in Julia\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(strip(md), '\\n') \n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question *= line[13:end] # removing the '# Question' part\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer *= line[12:end]   # removing the '# Answer' part\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer)) \nend\n```\n\nThis function splits your markdown text into lines and then iterates over each line. If a line starts with `# Question`, it appends the rest of the line to `question` after removing that part. Likewise, if a line starts with `# Answer`, it appends the rest of the line to `answer`. The `strip()` function is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from each string before returning them as a tuple.\n\nThis simple approach assumes that all questions and answers are on their own lines starting with '# Question' or '# Answer'. If your markdown format can vary, you may need to adapt this code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,311],"elapsed":2.401156024,"_type":"aimessage"}]
