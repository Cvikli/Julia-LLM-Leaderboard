[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

It iterates over all blocks in the parsed document. If a block is a pair and its first element's head is `:section`, it extracts the text of the section. The text is then checked for the keywords \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". Based on this, it decides whether the current section is a question or an answer. If so, it removes these keywords from the text before appending it to either `question` or `answer`.\n\nThis solution assumes that the Markdown sections for questions and answers do not contain nested blocks (such as lists inside paragraphs). It also assumes that all text in the section is plain text without any additional formatting. Adjustments may be necessary if these assumptions do not hold true in your specific use case.","status":200,"tokens":[0,663],"elapsed":5.374964964,"_type":"aimessage"}]
