[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function written in Julia that will extract the question and answer sections from the provided Markdown formatted text:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String, instructions = nothing)\n    lines = split(strip(md), '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")  # start of question section\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer && break\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")   # start of answer section\n            in_answer = true\n            in_question && (break)\n        end\n        \n        if in_question \n            question *= strip(line[end-1:end]) * \"\\n\"  # add stripped line to the question text, append a newline\n        elseif in_answer \n            answer *= strip(line[end-1:end]) * \"\\n\"    # add stripped line to the answer text, append a newline\n        end\n        \n    end\n    \n    if instructions !== nothing && haskey(instructions, \"strip_newlines\") && convert(Bool, instructions[\"strip_newlines\"])\n        question = replace(question, \"\\n\" => \"\")  # remove new lines from the question\n        answer = replace(answer, \"\\n\" => \"\")      # remove new lines from the answer\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each line of the provided markdown string. If a line starts with \"# Question\", it sets `in_question` to true and stops reading once an \"Answer\" section is found, or if the end of the markdown string is reached. Same goes for the answer section.\n\nInside each section, every non-empty lines are added to the respective variable stripped from leading spaces and trailing newline characters, appending a newline character after each addition. If `instructions` contains `\"strip_newlines\"` key set to `true`, new line characters are replaced by nothing in both question and answer texts.\n\nThe function returns a tuple of two strings, first being the question text and second being the answer text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,506],"elapsed":4.063523503,"_type":"aimessage"}]
