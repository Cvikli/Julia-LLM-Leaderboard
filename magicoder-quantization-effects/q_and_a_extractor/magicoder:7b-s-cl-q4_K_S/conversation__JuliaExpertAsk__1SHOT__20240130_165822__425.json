Each matching group is a list of three elements: the entire block (including the header), the question, and the answer. These are then stripped of leading spaces and newlines using the `strip()` method and returned as a tuple of tuples.\n\nYou can use it like this:\n\n```python\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question 1\nThis is the first question? \nYes, it's a question.  \n# Answer 1\nHere is the answer to the first question. \n\n# Question 2\nIs this a second question? \nNo, it's not a question. \n# Answer 2\nHere is the answer to the second question. \n\"\"\"\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(md))  \n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```python\n[('This is the first question?', 'Yes, it\\'s a question.'), ('Is this a second question?', 'No, it\\'s not a question.')]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,387],"elapsed":3.021095072,"_type":"aimessage"}]
