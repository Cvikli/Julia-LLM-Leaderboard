[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can create a function `q_and_a_extractor` in Julia to solve this problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question = strip(replace(md, r\"^# Question\\n\" => \"\"))\n    answer   = strip(replace(md, r\"^# Answer\\n\" => \"\"))\n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function strips the `# Question` and `# Answer` parts of the markdown text `md`, leaving only the actual question and answer. You can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\nmarkdown_text = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is your name?\n\n# Answer\nMy name is Julia.\n\"\"\"\nq, a = q_and_a_extractor(markdown_text)\nprintln(\"Question: $q\")\nprintln(\"Answer  : $a\")\n```\n\nThis will print out the question and answer as separate strings. Note that this code assumes that there is only one `# Question` and `# Answer` pair in `md`. If there are multiple, you might want to adjust the regex patterns to match the specific sections you're interested in.","status":200,"tokens":[0,275],"elapsed":2.184909874,"_type":"aimessage"}]
