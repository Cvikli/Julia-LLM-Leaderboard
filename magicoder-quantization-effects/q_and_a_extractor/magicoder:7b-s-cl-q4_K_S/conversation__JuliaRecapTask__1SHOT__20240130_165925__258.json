[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this task by using regular expressions to identify the sections of the markdown that represent the question and the answer, then remove unwanted leading whitespace and newline characters:\n\nHere is a simple implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions \n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    pattern = r\"^(# Question)(.*?)\\n^(# Answer)(.*)\"s\n    match = match(pattern, md, init=0ms)\n    \n    if match != nothing\n        question = strip(match.captures[2])\n        answer = strip(match.captures[4])\n        \n        return (question, answer)\n    else\n        return (\"No Question or Answer section found\", \"\")\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function `q_and_a_extractor` takes a string `md` as input, which represents the markdown text. The regular expression pattern `pattern` matches the sections of the markdown that contain the question and answer. This pattern will match lines starting with `# Question` or `# Answer`, capturing everything in between these lines, until it encounters another line starting with `#`. It then strips any leading whitespace and newline characters from these captured texts. If there is no matching section in `md`, it returns two empty strings as the question and answer. \n\nThis code assumes that the markdown sections start at the beginning of a line, which seems to be a standard in markdown-formatted text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,329],"elapsed":2.62333329,"_type":"aimessage"}]
