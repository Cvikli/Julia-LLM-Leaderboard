If it encounters lines that start with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively, it knows to start capturing the corresponding section of text until it encounters another header or an empty line. It then returns a tuple containing the question string and answer string. Note the use of `startswith()` function to check if the line starts with the given pattern.\n\nRemember to strip leading spaces and newlines before comparing with `# Question` and `# Answer`. This is done using `strip(strippedline)`. The extra space is added in question and answer strings for preserving formatting.","status":200,"tokens":[0,562],"elapsed":4.471989089,"_type":"aimessage"}]
