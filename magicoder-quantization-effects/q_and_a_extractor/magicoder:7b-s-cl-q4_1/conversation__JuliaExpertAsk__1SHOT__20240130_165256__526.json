It appends to `question` and `answer` only when they are active, and strips leading spaces.\n\nTesting this function with a sample markdown:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question \nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer \nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md)) # prints (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[128,342],"elapsed":2.772574662,"_type":"aimessage"}]
