Then it goes through each block one by one. If a Header block is encountered with \"Question\" or \"Answer\", it sets a flag to start or stop capturing text respectively. If a Paragraph block is encountered and we are capturing an answer, it appends the content of that paragraph into the answer variable after stripping any leading spaces and newlines. Similarly, if we're not capturing an answer but encountering another paragraph, it adds that to the question. The function finally returns the question-answer pair as a Tuple once all blocks have been processed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,397],"elapsed":3.184934679,"_type":"aimessage"}]
