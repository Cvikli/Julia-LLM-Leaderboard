[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can solve this problem using Julia programming language:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    text = Markdown.parse(md)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestionSection = false\n    inAnswerSection = false\n    for element in text.content\n        if isa(element, Markdown.Header) && element.level == 1\n            if startswith(element.text[1], \"Question\")\n                inQuestionSection = true\n            elseif startswith(element.text[1], \"Answer\")\n                inAnswerSection = true\n            end\n        elseif isa(element, Markdown.Paragraph) && (inQuestionSection || inAnswerSection)\n            if inQuestionSection \n                question *= strip(element.text[1])\n            elseif inAnswerSection \n                answer *= strip(element.text[1])\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, the Markdown text is parsed into an object of type `Markdown.Document`, which contains a vector `content` of elements. Each element can be either a header (`Markdown.Header`) or a paragraph (`Markdown.Paragraph`). The headers contain the title and level information; the paragraphs contain the actual text.\n\nThe function loops over each element in the content list, checks if it's a header with appropriate level (1 for question and 2 for answer), and sets the corresponding boolean to true when it finds a question or an answer section.\n\nWhen a paragraph is encountered while being inside either the question or the answer sections, its text gets concatenated to the current question or answer respectively after stripping leading spaces.\n\nAt the end, the function returns the question and answer strings. Note that this assumes headers are correctly used as they should be in a markdown document: first-level headers are only used for questions and second level headers are only used for answers. If there's any deviation from this pattern, the function may not work properly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,467],"elapsed":3.860471479,"_type":"aimessage"}]
