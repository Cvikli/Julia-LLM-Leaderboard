Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use regular expressions to match patterns in strings. Here's how you might implement this function:\n\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    for line in lines\n        if match(r\"^# Question\", line) !== nothing\n            question *= replace(line[8:end], r\"\\s*\", \"\")\n        elseif match(r\"^# Answer\", line) !== nothing\n            answer *= replace(line[9:end], r\"\\s*\", \"\")\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function splits the input string `md` into individual lines and then iterates over each line. If a line starts with \"# Question\" it appends the rest of the line to the question variable after removing leading spaces. If a line starts with \"# Answer\", it does the same for the answer variable. The `replace(line[8:end], r\"\\s*\", \"\")` removes any leading spaces from each line.\n\nTo test this function, you could do something like:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat's the meaning of life?\n# Answer\nThe meaning of life is 42, according to the `Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy` by Douglas Adams.\n\"\"\"\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md))\n```\nThis should print out a tuple containing the question and answer:\n```julia\n(\"What's the meaning of life?\", \"The meaning of life is 42, according to the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams.\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,400],"elapsed":3.228023977,"_type":"aimessage"}]
