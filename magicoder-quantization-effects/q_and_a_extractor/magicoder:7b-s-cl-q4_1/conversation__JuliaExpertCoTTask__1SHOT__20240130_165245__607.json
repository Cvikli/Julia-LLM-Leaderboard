The regular expression for the question and answer sections are designed such that they capture all text between \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\" and either a new section or the end of the string, with the `DOTALL | MULTILINE` flags allowing them to span multiple lines. The `.group(1)` function is used to extract the matched text. If both questions and answers are found, they are stripped of leading spaces and newlines using the `strip()` method. \n\nIf either a question or an answer was not found in the provided markdown text, the code will return \"No question or answer found.\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,392],"elapsed":3.197509306,"_type":"aimessage"}]
