Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can create such function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    q = false\n    a = false\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"## Question\")\n            q = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if startswith(line, \"## Answer\")\n            a = true\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if q && !startswith(line, \"# \")\n            question *= line[2:end]\n        end\n\n        if a && !startswith(line, \"# \")\n            answer *= line[2:end]\n        end\n    end\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function splits the markdown string into lines and then checks each line to see if it starts with \"## Question\" or \"## Answer\". If so, it sets a flag accordingly and continues to next line. If the line does not start with \"# \", it appends the text to the question or answer strings. It removes leading spaces and newlines from the extracted texts before returning them in a tuple.\nPlease note that this function assumes that the \"## Question\" and \"## Answer\" sections are correctly formatted, i.e., they appear at the beginning of lines with no preceding characters. If there could be more text before or after these lines (e.g., lists, code blocks), you would need to adapt the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,349],"elapsed":2.796739211,"_type":"aimessage"}]
