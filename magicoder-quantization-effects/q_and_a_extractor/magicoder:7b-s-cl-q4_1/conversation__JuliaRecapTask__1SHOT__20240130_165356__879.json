[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can approach this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(strip(md), '\\n')\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    q_flag, a_flag = false, false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            q_flag, a_flag = true, false\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            q_flag, a_flag = false, true\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if q_flag \n            question *= line[6:end] # strip leading space and '# '\n        elseif a_flag\n            answer *= line\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nThe function `q_and_a_extractor` takes an AbstractString argument `md` which is the markdown formatted text. We first split the string into lines, then iterate through these lines. If we encounter a line that starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", we set our flags accordingly and continue to the next line (to avoid adding unwanted characters). We also strip leading spaces from these sections because they are usually added for formatting purposes. The final step is to return the extracted question and answer as a tuple after stripping any leading or trailing white spaces with `strip()`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,326],"elapsed":2.686253751,"_type":"aimessage"}]
