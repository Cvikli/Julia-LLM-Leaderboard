We then iterate over each line. If a line starts with \"# Question\", we start adding text to the question part of our answer. Similarly if a line starts with \"# Answer\", we stop adding to the question and start adding to the answer instead. Any other lines that are encountered while in the question section will be added to the question, and any other lines when not in the question section will add to the answer. Finally, we return the extracted question and answer after removing leading and trailing spaces with `strip()`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,324],"elapsed":2.604537778,"_type":"aimessage"}]
