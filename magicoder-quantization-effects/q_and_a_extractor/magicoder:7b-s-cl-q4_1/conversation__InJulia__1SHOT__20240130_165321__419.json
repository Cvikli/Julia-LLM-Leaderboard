The function `q_and_a_extractor` splits the markdown string into lines, checks for lines that start with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", removes the leading whitespace and returns a tuple of (question, answer) with all leading/trailing whitespaces removed:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestion = false\n    inAnswer = false\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestion = true\n            inAnswer = false\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inQuestion = false\n            inAnswer = true\n        elseif inQuestion && !startswith(line, \"# \") && line != \"\"\n            question *= replace(line, r\"^[ \\t]*\\n\", \"\")\n        elseif inAnswer && !startswith(line, \"# \") && line != \"\"\n            answer *= replace(line, r\"^[ \\t]*\\n\", \"\")\n        end\n    end\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md)) # prints (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[98,361],"elapsed":2.925836953,"_type":"aimessage"}]
