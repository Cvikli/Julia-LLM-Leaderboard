[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"This task can be solved by using Julia's powerful regular expressions (regex). You will need to use the `replace` function in conjunction with a regular expression that matches the `#` followed by word characters and spaces.\n\nHere is a basic implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Remove leading/trailing whitespace and newlines\n    cleaned_md = replace(strip(md), r\"\\n\" => \" \")\n    \n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    lines = split(cleaned_md, '\\n')\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question *= replace(line[14:end], r\"#.*$\" => \"\")\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer *= replace(line[10:end], r\"#.*$\" => \"\")\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThe `q_and_a_extractor` function first cleans the markdown text by removing all newlines and leading/trailing spaces. It then splits the cleaned text into an array of lines based on newline characters (`'\\n'`). It iterates over each line, checking if it starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If so, it removes the part after the hashtag from the respective variable. The final step is to return a tuple of the question and answer. Note that this implementation assumes that there are no other lines starting with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", and that there is only one question followed by one answer in the markdown text. If there can be multiple questions/answers, you would need to modify the function accordingly.\n\nIn terms of special instructions, any specific steps or requirements should be included within {{instructions}} placeholder. The above function does not include handling for these instructions as they are specified in the problem statement and depends on your task's implementation.","status":200,"tokens":[0,445],"elapsed":3.68752461,"_type":"aimessage"}]
