Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example Python function that can do this using regular expressions:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = re.search(\"# Question(.*?)# Answer\", md, re.DOTALL | re.IGNORECASE)\n    answer = re.search(\"## Answer(.*?)$\", md, re.DOTALL | re.IGNORECASE)\n    \n    if not question or not answer:\n        return (\"No Question or Answer found in the input.\", \"\")\n        \n    question_text = question.group(1).strip()\n    answer_text = answer.group(1).strip()\n    \n    return (question_text, answer_text)\n```\n\nThis function will work assuming that there is a clear separation between questions and answers sections in the markdown text, and that each section starts with `# Question` for question and `## Answer` for answer. It also ignores case differences when searching for these lines.\n\nHowever, it assumes that both the Question and Answer sections are single-line texts. If there can be multiple lines, you should remove the `.` in `(.*?)` to make them greedy matchers, instead of lazy ones. \n\nAlso note: this function will not work if there is more than one Question or Answer section in the markdown text and it won't handle nested sections well either. For that you might need a more complex parser.","status":200,"tokens":[0,317],"elapsed":2.551158771,"_type":"aimessage"}]
