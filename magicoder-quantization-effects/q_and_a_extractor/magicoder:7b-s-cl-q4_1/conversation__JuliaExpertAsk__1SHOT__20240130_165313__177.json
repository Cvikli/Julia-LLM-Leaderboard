For every line it checks if it starts with `# Answer` or `# Question`. If found, it extracts the text that follows this line and assigns it to `question` or `answer`, respectively. The extracted texts are then joined back together without leading spaces using a list comprehension where the `strip()` method is used to remove any leading spaces before joining. \n\nThe function finally returns a tuple containing the question and answer, if they were found in the markdown text. If not, it will return `(None, None)`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,273],"elapsed":2.191323675,"_type":"aimessage"}]
