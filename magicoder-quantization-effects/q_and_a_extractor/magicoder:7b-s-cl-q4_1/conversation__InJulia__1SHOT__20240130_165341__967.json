[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use the `each_line` function to process each line of markdown text separately. Use regular expressions to identify the sections \"Question\" and \"Answer\". Then you need to append the lines of text in those sections until a different section is encountered. Here is an example of how it could be done:\n\n```julia\nimport REGEXP_PATTERN = r\"^(# )?((.*))\"\nfunction each_line(lines::Vector{SubString})\n    for line in lines\n        m = match(REGEXP_PATTERN, SubString(line))\n        if !isnothing(m)\n            return SubString(line)\n        end\n    end\nend\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::SubString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestion = false\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestion = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inQuestion = false\n        elseif inQuestion && !startswith(line, \" \")\n            question *= strip(SubString(line))\n        elseif !inQuestion && !startswith(line, \" \")\n            answer *= strip(SubString(line))\n        end\n    end\n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\n\nIn the above function, `each_line` is assumed to be defined elsewhere. It processes a vector of lines and returns a line for each iteration. In our main function, we split the markdown text into lines using \"\\n\" as a delimiter and then process each line separately. If we encounter a line that starts with \"# Question\", we switch to collecting question text; if it's an \"Answer\", we switch to collecting answer text. Any leading spaces in lines are removed by `strip`.\n\nTest this function like:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question \nWhat is your name?\n# Answer\nMy name is Julia.\n\"\"\"\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md))\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,475],"elapsed":3.819001341,"_type":"aimessage"}]
