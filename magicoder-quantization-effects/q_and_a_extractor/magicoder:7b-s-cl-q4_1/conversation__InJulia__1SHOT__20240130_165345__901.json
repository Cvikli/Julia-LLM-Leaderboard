[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could solve this problem using Julia. We will use `eachline` function to read line by line, and `startswith` method to check if a line starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`. If it does, we strip all leading spaces and newlines from the text and append it to our respective variables (question, answer).\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    current = \"\"\n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md)) # read lines from string\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            current = \"question\"\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            current = \"answer\"\n        elseif current == \"question\" && !startswith(line, \" \") \n            question *= line\n        elseif current == \"answer\" && !startswith(line, \" \") \n            answer *= line\n        end\n    end\n    return strip(rstrip(question)), strip(rstrip(answer)) # remove trailing and leading spaces\nend\n```\nThis function should work for the majority of markdown files. If your markdown files have a different format, you might need to adjust this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,280],"elapsed":2.232238492,"_type":"aimessage"}]
