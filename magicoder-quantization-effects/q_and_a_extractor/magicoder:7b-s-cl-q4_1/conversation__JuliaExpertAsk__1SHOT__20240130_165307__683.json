It checks if a line starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`, and if so, it sets the corresponding variable to capture the rest of the text until another header is found. Note that it assumes that all headers are exactly one level deep (i.e., `##` won't be used).","status":200,"tokens":[0,246],"elapsed":1.97732934,"_type":"aimessage"}]
