[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here is an example function in Julia that solves this task:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    question_flag = false\n    answer_flag = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question_flag = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer_flag = true\n        elseif question_flag && !answer_flag \n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif !question_flag && answer_flag \n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function splits the markdown text into lines and checks each line for the tags indicating whether it is a question or an answer. If found, it starts accumulating the relevant part of the text until another tag is encountered. The `startswith` function is used to match the start of each line with the corresponding tag, and `strip` is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\nPlease remember to include your special instructions within the markdown text as follows: `# Question`. `# Answer`, and any other text following these tags are interpreted as question or answer by the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,304],"elapsed":2.502074645,"_type":"aimessage"}]
