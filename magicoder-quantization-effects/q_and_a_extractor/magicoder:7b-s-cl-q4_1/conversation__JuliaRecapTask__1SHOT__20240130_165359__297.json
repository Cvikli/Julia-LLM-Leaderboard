[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem by using the `each_line` function to iterate through each line of markdown text and manually checking for the start and end of a question and answer. Here is an example implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestion = false\n    inAnswer = false\n\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"## Question\")\n            inQuestion = true\n            inAnswer = false\n        elseif startswith(line, \"## Answer\")\n            inQuestion = false\n            inAnswer = true\n        else\n            if inQuestion\n                question *= line[end:end]\n            elseif inAnswer\n                answer *= line[end:end]\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return strip(question), strip(answer)\nend\n```\n\nIn this solution, `startswith` is a function from Julia standard library that checks if the given string starts with another string. The `strip` function removes any leading spaces and newlines from the strings. The `*` operator for concatenation of strings in Julia automatically adds a space between two strings if there isn't one already. If no such sections are found, it will return an empty string. \n\nIf you want to use this function with a markdown file, first read the file and convert it into a string:\n```julia\nopen(\"myfile.md\") do f\n    question, answer = q_and_a_extractor(read(f, String))\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,367],"elapsed":3.028203206,"_type":"aimessage"}]
