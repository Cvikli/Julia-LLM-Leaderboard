[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could write `q_and_a_extractor` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestion = false\n    for line in split(md, '\\n')\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestion = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inQuestion = false\n        elseif inQuestion\n            question *= strip(line)\n        else\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nThis function `q_and_a_extractor` takes a string argument `md`, splits it into lines using the newline character as delimiter and goes through each line. It checks if the current line starts with `\"# Question\"`, `\"# Answer\"` or if it's a continuation of a question/answer by checking the `inQuestion` flag. If the line starts with `# Question`, it sets `inQuestion = true`. If it's an answer, it sets `inQuestion = false`. If `inQuestion == true`, then append the stripped line to `question`, else append to `answer`. The function finally returns a tuple of question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,292],"elapsed":2.335737519,"_type":"aimessage"}]
