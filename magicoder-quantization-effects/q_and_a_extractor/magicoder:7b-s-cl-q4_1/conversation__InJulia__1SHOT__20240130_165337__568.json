[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can achieve that using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")  # Split markdown into lines\n    \n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"## Question\")\n            in_question = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"## Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n        elseif in_question\n            question *= strip(line)  # Concatenate questions and strip leading/trailing spaces\n        else\n            answer *= strip(line)   # Concatenate answers and strip leading/trailing spaces\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nIn the function `q_and_a_extractor`, we loop over each line of the markdown. If a line starts with \"## Question\", then we start storing questions in our variable `question`. If it is an answer, we store it in `answer`. We strip leading spaces and newline characters from both lines before concatenating them into their respective variables. Finally, we return a tuple containing the question and answer.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that markdown sections start with \"## Question\" or \"## Answer\", which may not always be true depending on how your markdown is formatted. You would need to modify it according to your specific markdown format if needed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,331],"elapsed":2.654758525,"_type":"aimessage"}]
