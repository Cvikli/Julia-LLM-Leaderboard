If found, it strips those prefixes and any leading/trailing spaces and assigns them to `question` or `answer`, respectively. The function finally returns a tuple of the question and answer (if both were found).\n\nPlease note that this script assumes that there is only one question followed by one answer in the markdown text, and it does not handle cases where these sections may be nested or the sections may have other prefixes like `##`. For more complex use cases, you might need a more sophisticated approach.","status":200,"tokens":[0,316],"elapsed":2.532349419,"_type":"aimessage"}]
