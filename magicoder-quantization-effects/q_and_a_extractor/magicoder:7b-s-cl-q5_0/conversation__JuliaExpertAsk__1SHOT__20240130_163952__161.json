It then strips leading spaces and newlines from these sections, concatenates them together into strings, and returns a tuple of these two strings.\nPlease note this assumes that there's only one question per markdown file (as per the problem statement) and that the question is always followed by an answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,306],"elapsed":2.653533905,"_type":"aimessage"}]
