Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple approach to solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    foundQuestion = false\n    foundAnswer = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            foundQuestion = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if foundQuestion && !startswith(line, \"# Answer\") \n            question *= strip(line)\n        end\n        \n        if startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            foundAnswer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if foundAnswer && !startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nThis function splits the input string into lines and iterates over them. It checks each line to see whether it starts with either `# Question` or `# Answer`. If so, it sets a flag accordingly. During that iteration, if it is in the `question` part (foundQuestion is true but not foundAnswer), it appends the stripped version of the line to question. Similarly for `answer`. Once the function has gone through all lines, it returns the tuple of (question, answer).\n\nLet's test our function with the given data:\n```julia\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"))\n```\nIt should output: `(\"What is the capital of France?\",\"The capital of France is Paris.\")`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,380],"elapsed":3.295106849,"_type":"aimessage"}]
