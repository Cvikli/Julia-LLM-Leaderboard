[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The following is an implementation of your request using regular expressions in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String) \n    q_pattern = r\"# Question(.+?)(?=# Answer)\"s\n    a_pattern = r\"# Answer(.+?)\\n\"s\n    question = match(q_pattern, md)\n    answer = match(a_pattern, md)\n    \n    if question === nothing \n        throw(ArgumentError(\"No question found\"))\n    end\n    if answer === nothing \n        throw(ArgumentError(\"No answer found\"))\n    end\n    return (strip.(question.captures[1]), strip(answer.captures[1]))\nend\n```\n\nThis code uses the RegularExpressions module to match the patterns of the question and answer within the provided markdown string. The '?=' operator specifies a non-greedy match, so that it stops at the first '# Answer' encountered. The '.+?' matches any character (except for a newline) 1 or more times, but as few times as possible.\n\nThe `strip` function is used to remove leading whitespaces and newlines from the matched sections. If no question or answer is found in the input string, an error will be thrown.\n\nNote: This code assumes that there are only one '# Question' section and one '# Answer' section within the markdown string. If there could be multiple sections of each type and you want to collect them all, you would need a different approach, possibly involving splitting the string by '\\n# ', filtering for '# Question' and '# Answer', and then using regular expressions on each part separately.","status":200,"tokens":[0,374],"elapsed":3.308588282,"_type":"aimessage"}]
