Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

In this way, all text following these lines is appended to the question or answer respectively. Finally, it returns the extracted question and answer as a tuple. Note that if the input markdown doesn't conform to the given format, this function may behave unpredictably.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question 1\nThis is a question?\n\n## Answer 1\nThis is an answer to Q1\n\"\"\"\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md)) # (\"This is a question\", \"This is an answer to Q1\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,372],"elapsed":3.212597216,"_type":"aimessage"}]
