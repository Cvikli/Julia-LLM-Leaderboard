[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation using regular expressions to identify the start of each section:\n\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer   = \"\"\n    \n    for line in split(md, '\\n') \n        if occursin(r\"^# Question\", line) \n            question *= strip(line[11:end])\n        elseif occursin(r\"^# Answer\", line) \n            answer   *= strip(line[8:end])\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nThis function splits the markdown `md` into individual lines and goes through each one. When it encounters a line that starts with `# Question`, it extracts everything after the `#` symbol (`line[11:end]`) and adds it to the question string, similarly for `# Answer`. The `strip()` function is used to remove any leading spaces or newlines from the extracted text.\n\nNote: This assumes the markdown sections are on their own lines (i.e., not nested). Also, there are no other `#` characters in the text before `# Question` and `# Answer`, so it uses `^` for start of line. If this is not the case, a more complex parsing would be necessary.","status":200,"tokens":[0,301],"elapsed":2.58217625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
