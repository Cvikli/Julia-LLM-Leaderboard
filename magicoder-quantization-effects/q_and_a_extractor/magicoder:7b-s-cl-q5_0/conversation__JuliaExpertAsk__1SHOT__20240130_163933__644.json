Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem using Python's built-in `re` module to perform regular expression matching. Below is an example of how you might implement such a function:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = re.search(r'\\n# Question\\n(.*?)\\n', md, re.DOTALL)\n    answer = re.search(r'\\n# Answer\\n(.*?)\\n', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    if question and answer:\n        return (question.group(1).strip(), answer.group(1).strip())\n    else:\n        return None\n```\n\nIn the function above, we use regular expressions to search for lines that start with `# Question` or `# Answer`. The `re.DOTALL` flag allows `.` in our regex to match any character (including newlines), and `(.*?)` matches any characters (but as few as possible) until it hits either the end of a line (`\\n`) or a matching pair of brackets.\n\nIf a question and an answer are found, this function returns them stripped of leading spaces and newlines; if not, it returns `None`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,268],"elapsed":2.322817519,"_type":"aimessage"}]
