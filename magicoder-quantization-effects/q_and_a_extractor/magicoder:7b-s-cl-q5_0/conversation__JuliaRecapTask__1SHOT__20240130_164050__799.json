[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function to solve the problem:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split markdown into sections by lines\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    \n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestionSection = false\n    inAnswerSection = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestionSection = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inAnswerSection = true\n        elseif inQuestionSection && !isempty(line)\n            question *= rstrip(lstrip(line)) # append and strip leading/trailing spaces\n        elseif inAnswerSection && !isempty(line)\n            answer *= rstrip(lstrip(line)) \n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating through each line of the markdown string. When it encounters a line starting with `# Question` or `# Answer`, it sets `inQuestionSection` and `inAnswerSection` to true respectively. Subsequent lines are then added to question or answer strings, stripping leading/trailing spaces as they're being built. After going through all the lines, it returns a tuple of (question,answer). If there is no Question section or Answer section in the markdown string, an empty string will be returned for the corresponding part. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that each `# Question` and `# Answer` section are separated by one or more blank lines. It also does not handle nested questions or answers.","status":200,"tokens":[0,364],"elapsed":3.227466432,"_type":"aimessage"}]
