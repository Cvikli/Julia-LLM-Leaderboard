[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question *= strip(replace(line[13:end],\" \" => \"\"))\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer *= strip(replace(line[9:end],\" \" => \"\"))\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nThis function splits the markdown string into a vector of lines. It then iterates through each line in the vector and checks if it starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If it does, it appends the stripped text to the appropriate variable `question` or `answer`. It finally returns a tuple containing these two strings.\n\nRemember that this function assumes that your markdown text is formatted correctly. If not, you may need to adjust the logic inside the loop to handle other possible formats.","status":200,"tokens":[0,252],"elapsed":2.166061553,"_type":"aimessage"}]
