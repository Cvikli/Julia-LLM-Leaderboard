Here's a solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Find the start of each section using regex\n    question_match = match(r\"# Question([\\s\\S]+?)# Answer\", md)\n    answer_match = match(r\"# Answer([\\s\\S]+?$)\", md)\n\n    if !isnothing(question_match) && !isnothing(answer_match)\n        # Extract the text from each section and strip leading spaces and newlines\n        question = replace(question_match.captures[1], r\"^\\s*\" => \"\")\n        answer = replace(answer_match.captures[1], r\"^\\s*\" => \"\")\n\n        return (question, answer)\n    elseif isnothing(question_match) && !isnothing(answer_match)\n        @warn \"No Question section found in markdown.\"\n    elseif !isnothing(question_match) && isnothing(answer_match)\n        @warn \"No Answer section found in markdown.\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `match` function to find matches and then `replace` with a regex to strip leading spaces. If either the question or answer sections are missing, it warns about this situation.","status":200,"tokens":[0,340],"elapsed":2.935615043,"_type":"aimessage"}]
