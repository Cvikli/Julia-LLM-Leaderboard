If a line contains the words \"Question\", it sets the `in_question` flag to True, and if a line contains the word \"Answer\", it sets the `in_answer` flag to True. These flags are used to determine which part of the document is currently being read: if `in_question` is True, we add the current line to the question string, and if `in_answer` is True, we add the current line to the answer string.\n\nAfter going through all lines, it returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer. The re.sub function is used to remove any leading spaces or newlines from each line before adding them to the question/answer strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,431],"elapsed":3.801153723,"_type":"aimessage"}]
