[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you might go about solving this problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n') # Split markdown into lines\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    inQuestion, inAnswer = false, false\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line,\"# Question\")\n            inQuestion = true\n            continue\n        end\n        if startswith(line,\"# Answer\")\n            inAnswer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        # If we're in a question or answer section, and line is not empty, append it to the respective string.\n        if inQuestion && !isempty(line)\n            question *= strip(line[3:end]) # Strip leading spaces and '# ' from each line\n        elseif inAnswer && !isempty(line)\n            answer *= strip(line[3:end]) \n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating through each line of the markdown. If a line indicates a new section (# Question or # Answer), it toggles whether we're currently in that section and continues to the next line. Otherwise, if we're in either question or answer sections and the current line is not empty, it appends the stripped text to the respective string. The `strip(line[3:end])` bit removes any leading '# ' from each line.\n\nThis function assumes that there are no other lines starting with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", and that every question section has an associated answer section (though it doesn't check for this). It also does not handle cases where a markdown might contain multiple questions/answers, as it stops at the first \"# Answer\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,398],"elapsed":3.445218044,"_type":"aimessage"}]
