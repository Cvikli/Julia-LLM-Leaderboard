Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

It then returns the collected text in a tuple. Note that this function assumes there is only one Question and Answer section in the markdown text, and ignores any other sections.\n\nYou can call the function with some markdown as follows:\n```julia\nmarkdown = \"\"\"\n# Question\nThis is the question?\n\n# Answer\nThis is the answer. \n\"\"\"\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(markdown)) # prints (\"This is the question?\", \"This is the answer.\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[98,360],"elapsed":3.173040857,"_type":"aimessage"}]
