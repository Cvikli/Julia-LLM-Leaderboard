It then iterates through each line to identify whether the current line is a Question or an Answer section. If so, it sets a flag for that section and continues to the next line without processing. If not a special line but inside either question or answer sections, it appends stripped lines to their respective variables.\n\nFinally, it returns a tuple of the extracted question and answer text.\n\nNote: This function assumes that the Question/Answer structure starts with `#` followed by a space, and that each section ends with another `#` line. If these assumptions are not accurate, you may need to modify this solution slightly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,337],"elapsed":2.901081379,"_type":"aimessage"}]
