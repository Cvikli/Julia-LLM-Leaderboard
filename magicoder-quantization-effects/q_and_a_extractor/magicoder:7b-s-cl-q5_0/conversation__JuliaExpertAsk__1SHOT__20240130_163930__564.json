Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how this function could look using Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    lines = md.split(\"\\n\")\n    \n    for line in lines:\n        if line.strip().startswith(\"# Question\"):\n            question = re.sub('^ +', '', line.lstrip('#').strip())\n            \n        elif line.strip().startswith(\"# Answer\"):\n            answer = re.sub('^ +', '', line.lstrip('#').strip())\n\n    return (question,answer)\n```\n\nThis function first splits the input markdown text into lines. It then iterates over these lines and checks if each line starts with '# Question' or '# Answer'. If it does, it updates the respective variable `question` or `answer`. The '^ +' regular expression removes leading spaces before '#', and '.strip()' is used to remove any newline characters at the start of the text.\nFinally, it returns a tuple containing the question and answer extracted from the markdown. \n\nThis function assumes that there is only one `# Question` and `# Answer` in your input markdown and the order doesn't change, but if you expect more than one question/answer pair or if they could be out of order, you would need a different approach such as using a stack to keep track of which question goes with which answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,321],"elapsed":2.759980832,"_type":"aimessage"}]
