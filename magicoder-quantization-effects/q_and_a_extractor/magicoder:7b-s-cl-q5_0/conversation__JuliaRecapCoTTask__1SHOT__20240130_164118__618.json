[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is a basic implementation of the task using regular expressions to extract the sections. The function `q_and_a_extractor` takes as input a markdown-formatted string and returns a tuple with the question and answer after stripping any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text. The regular expression pattern `'# (Question|Answer)[\\s\\S]*?(?=(?:##|\\Z))'` is used to capture all lines between `# Question` or `# Answer` tags until the next `# ` tag or the end of the string.\n\n```julia\nimport RE\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    pattern = r\"# (Question|Answer)[\\s\\S]*?(?=(?:##|\\Z))\"\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(pattern, md, 1))\n    \n    if isempty(matches) || length(matches) != 2 # Checking for exactly two sections: Question and Answer\n        return \"Invalid markdown format. Expected to have exactly one '# Question' and one '# Answer' sections.\"\n    end\n\n    question = replace(strip(matches[1].match), r\"\\n\" => \"\")\n    answer = replace(strip(matches[2].match), r\"\\n\" => \"\")\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\n\nTo use this function, simply call it with the markdown string:\n\n```julia\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Question\nThis is a question. \n\n# Answer\nHere's an answer to the question.  \n\"\"\"\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md_text)) # Output should be (\"This is a question.\", \"Here's an answer to the question.\")\n```\n\nPlease note that this function assumes the markdown sections are separated by a single line of `#` (hashes), which is typically how section headers work in markdown. It does not handle nested sections or other special markdown features. If your markdown uses different conventions, you'll need to modify the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,455],"elapsed":4.019460422,"_type":"aimessage"}]
