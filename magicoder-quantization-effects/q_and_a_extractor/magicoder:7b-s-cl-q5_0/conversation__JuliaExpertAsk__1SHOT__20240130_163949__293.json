If it is, it adds the stripped version of that line to the corresponding variable (question or answer). Note that this function assumes that the Question and Answer sections are one-lined headers (i.e., \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\") followed by the content of the respective section.\n\nYou can test this function with a markdown text like below:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question \nWhat is your name?\n\n# Answer \nMy name is Julia.\n\"\"\"\nq_and_a_extractor(md)\n```\nThe output should be `(\"What is your name?\", \"My name is Julia.\")`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,357],"elapsed":3.108909903,"_type":"aimessage"}]
