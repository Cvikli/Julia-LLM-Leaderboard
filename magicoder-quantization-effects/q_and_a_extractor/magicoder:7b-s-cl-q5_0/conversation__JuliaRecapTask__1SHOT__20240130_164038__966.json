[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

It assumes that the markdown is formatted correctly. The function `q_and_a_extractor` extracts all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer and returns them as a tuple. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    \n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n            in_question = false\n        end\n        \n        if in_question && !isempty(strip(line))\n            question *= strip(line)\n        end\n\n        if in_answer && !isempty(strip(line))\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function splits the markdown text by newline characters (`'\\n'`), then checks each line to see if it's a start of a Question or Answer section. If it is, it sets the corresponding boolean flag `in_question` and `in_answer` to true.\n\nThen, for every line in the lines array (which represents the markdown text split by newline characters), if we are currently inside a question/answer section and the line isn't just whitespace, add the stripped string to the corresponding variable. The stripped string is obtained with `strip(line)`. \n\nFinally, it returns a tuple of the extracted question and answer strings.\n  \nThis function assumes that there are no nested sections or other complexities in the markdown format, and only one Question section and one Answer section follow each other (no additional sections after that). If these conditions aren't met, more sophisticated parsing would be needed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,458],"elapsed":4.069395201,"_type":"aimessage"}]
