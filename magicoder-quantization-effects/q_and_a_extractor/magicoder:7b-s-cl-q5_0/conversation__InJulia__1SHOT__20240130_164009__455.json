Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

If a line starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`, it sets a flag for that section, but otherwise if the flag is set it appends the stripped text to either question or answer (depending on which flag was set). When both flags are set, it returns a tuple of the question and answer.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nThis is my question?\n## Answer\nThis is my answer!\n\"\"\"\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md)) # Output: (\"This is my question?\", \"This is my answer!\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,346],"elapsed":3.008099116,"_type":"aimessage"}]
