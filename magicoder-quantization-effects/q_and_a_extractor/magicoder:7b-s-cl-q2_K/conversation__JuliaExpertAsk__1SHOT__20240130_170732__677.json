Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python function that does exactly this:\n\n```python\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    lines = md.split('\\n')\n    question = ''\n    answer = ''\n    \n    for line in lines:\n        if line.startswith('# Question'):\n            question = line[len('# Question'):].strip()\n        elif line.startswith('# Answer'):\n            answer = line[len('# Answer'):].strip()\n            \n    return (question,answer)\n```\nThis function works by first splitting the markdown `md` into lines, then iterating over each line. If a line starts with `# Question`, it sets the value of `question`. Similarly if it starts with `# Answer`, it sets the value of `answer`. Finally it returns a tuple `(question, answer)`. \n\nKeep in mind that this function assumes a very simple structure for your markdown and might not work correctly if your markdown has more complex structures. You may want to adjust or improve upon this function depending on your needs.","status":200,"tokens":[0,228],"elapsed":1.725575291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
