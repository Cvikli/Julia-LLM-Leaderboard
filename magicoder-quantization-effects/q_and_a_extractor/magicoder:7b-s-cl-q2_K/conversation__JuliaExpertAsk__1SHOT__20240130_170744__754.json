Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple Python solution using regex:\n\n```python\nimport re\nfrom typing import Tuple\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md: str) -> Tuple[str, str]:\n    question = re.findall(r'# Question(.*?)(?=\\n## Answer|\\Z)', md, re.DOTALL)[0].strip()  # non-greedy match on regex  \n    answer = re.findall(r'# Answer(.*?)(?=\\n# Question|\\Z)', md, re.DOTALL)[0].strip()  # non-greedy match on regex  \n    return question, answer\n```\n\nHere is how this function works:\n\n- `re.findall()` scans the input string for all occurrences of the provided regular expression and returns them as a list of strings. In our case, it searches for sections starting with `# Question` or `# Answer`. The `(.*?)(?=\\n#|\\\\Z)` part in the regular expression is a non-greedy match which matches anything (.*) until a newline (`\\n`) character appears or the end of the string (`\\Z`). \n   - `re.DOTALL` means \".\" will match any character at all, including newlines and will not be line-sensitive.\n- The `.strip()` function is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from the matched text.\n\nThis solution assumes that there is exactly one `# Question` and `# Answer` sections in the input string. If there are multiple such sections, this function may behave unexpectedly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,348],"elapsed":2.640032081,"_type":"aimessage"}]
