[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n        end\n        \n        if in_question && !isempty(line) \n            question *= line[end-2:end] # Remove leading spaces and newline\n        end\n\n        if in_answer && !isempty(line)\n            answer *= line[end-2:end]  # Remove leading spaces and newline\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nThe `eachline` function is used to iterate through the lines of input string. The `startswith` function checks if a line starts with `\"# Question\"` or `\"# Answer\"`. \n\nIf we are currently processing a question section and this line is not empty, then append it to `question`. Likewise for answer section. Note that the strip function is used to remove any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\nFinally, the function returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer after stripping the unnecessary characters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,331],"elapsed":2.50023286,"_type":"aimessage"}]
