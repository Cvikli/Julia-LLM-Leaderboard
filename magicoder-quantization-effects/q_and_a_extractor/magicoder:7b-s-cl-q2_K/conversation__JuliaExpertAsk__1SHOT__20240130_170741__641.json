Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem using Python's `re` module to extract the required sections of the markdown text and then use string methods to remove leading spaces and newline characters. Here is a possible implementation:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    # Extracting sections \"Question\" and \"Answer\" from md.\n    question = re.findall('^# Question(.+?)(?=\\n##|$)', md, flags=re.DOTALL) \n    answer = re.findall('^# Answer(.+?)(?=\\n##|$)', md, flags=re.DOTALL) \n  \n    # Remove leading spaces and newline characters from the extracted text.\n    question = '\\n'.join(i.lstrip() for i in question[0].split('\\n')) if question else ''\n    answer = '\\n'.join(i.lstrip() for i in answer[0].split('\\n')) if answer else ''\n  \n    return (question, answer)\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions (`re`) to find the sections \"Question\" and \"Answer\". The `^` character in `.+?(?=\\n##|$)` is a positive lookahead which matches any character before it's followed by either a newline with two hashes (`##`), or end of the string (`$`). The `.+?` inside the parentheses makes the regex match non-greedy. So, as soon as it encounters something that matches its pattern (in this case, a newline with two hashes or end of the string), it stops matching and moves to the next section.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that every \"# Answer\" is followed immediately by another \"# Question\". If such conditions are not met, it will return empty strings for one or both of the question and answer sections.","status":200,"tokens":[0,406],"elapsed":3.088365369,"_type":"aimessage"}]
