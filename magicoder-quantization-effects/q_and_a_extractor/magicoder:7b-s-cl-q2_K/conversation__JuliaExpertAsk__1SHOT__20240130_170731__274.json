We iterate over each of these lines. Whenever a line matches \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", we change our state (`in_question` or `in_answer`) to True and continue reading subsequent lines. When we reach the end of the section, we stop reading more lines.\n\nThe extracted questions and answers are then concatenated together with some initial space characters for correct spacing and leading spaces and newlines are removed before being returned in a tuple as `(question, answer)`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,292],"elapsed":2.225647062,"_type":"aimessage"}]
