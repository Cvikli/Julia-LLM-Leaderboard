[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is one possible solution using Julia's powerful regular expression capabilities:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Use a regex to find all sections separated by '# '\n    sections = split(md, \"# \", keepempty=false)\n\n    # Split the first section into question and answer.\n    if length(sections[1]) == 0 || !startswith(sections[1], \"Question\")\n        error(\"No Question found in text.\")\n    end\n\n    question_answer = split(sections[1], \"\\n\")\n    if startswith(question_answer[1], \"# Answer\")\n        answer = join(question_answer[2:end], \"\\n\", keepempty=false)\n        question = join(question_answer[4:end], \"\\n\", keepempty=false)\n    else\n        error(\"No Answer found in text.\")\n    end\n\n    return (string_strip(question), string_strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis solution assumes that the markdown format is well-formed, meaning it has a structure of `# Question` followed by question content on subsequent lines, and `# Answer` followed by answer content. If this is not true in your case, you may need to adjust the solution accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,285],"elapsed":2.227342404,"_type":"aimessage"}]
