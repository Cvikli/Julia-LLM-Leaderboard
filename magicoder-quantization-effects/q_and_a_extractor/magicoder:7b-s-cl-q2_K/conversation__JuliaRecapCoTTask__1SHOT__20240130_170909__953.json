[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is a solution written in Julia. This code assumes that the markdown text follows the standard format of markdown sections for each question-answer pair. \n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the string into sections based on the headers\n    sections = split(md, \"\\n# \")\n\n    # Extract questions and answers from the markdown\n    question_index = findfirst(\"Question\", sections)\n    answer_index = findfirst(\"Answer\", sections)\n\n    if isnothing(question_index) || isnothing(answer_index) \n        error(\"Markdown does not contain a Question or Answer section.\")\n    end\n\n    question = join([split(sections[question_index], \"\\n\")[i] for i in 2:end])\n    answer = join([split(sections[answer_index], \"\\n\")[i] for i in 2:end])\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function works by first splitting the markdown into sections, and then identifying which section contains the Question and Answer headers. It will then concatenate all lines of the respective question and answer sections to form a single string without leading newlines or spaces. \n\nRemember: This code assumes that your markdown sections are properly formatted with `# Question` and `# Answer`. If you have different format, this function may not work as expected. Also note that it does not handle any specific instructions.","status":200,"tokens":[0,335],"elapsed":2.608011966,"_type":"aimessage"}]
