[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is your solution: \n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        ln = strip(rstrip(line))\n        \n        if ln == \"# Question\" \n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n        elseif ln == \"# Answer\"\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n        elseif in_question && startswith(ln, \"## \")\n            push!(questions, strip(line[3:end]))\n        elseif in_answer && startswith(ln, \"## \")\n            push!(answers, strip(line[3:end]))\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (join(questions, '\\n'), join(answers, '\\n'))\nend\n``` \n\nThis function reads the markdown string line by line. When it encounters a line `# Question`, it switches to capturing the question lines. When it encounters a line `# Answer`, it switches to capturing the answer lines. It continues this until all lines are read and the captured question and answer strings are returned as tuples. \n\nRemember that this solution assumes there is exactly one `# Question` followed by a single line, and followed immediately by `# Answer`. If there are multiple such sections or other special conditions in your markdown files, you may want to adjust this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,349],"elapsed":2.764510952,"_type":"aimessage"}]
