It checks for each line if it is a start of either question or answer section. If yes, it starts accumulating content in that specific section until another such section header is encountered. The content is stripped from leading spaces and newlines before being returned as a tuple representing the question and answer sections. Note: This function assumes that there will be at least one `# Question` followed by `# Answer`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,314],"elapsed":2.396952905,"_type":"aimessage"}]
