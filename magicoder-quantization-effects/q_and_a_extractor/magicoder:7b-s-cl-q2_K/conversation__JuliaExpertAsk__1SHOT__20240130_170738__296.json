When it encounters a line that says `# Question`, it starts recording lines into `question_lines`. Likewise for `# Answer`, but into `answer_lines`. It continues to record lines until it encounters another `#` directive at which point it stops recording.\n\nFinally, it returns the extracted questions and answers as a tuple after stripping any leading spaces or newlines from the lines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,315],"elapsed":2.388077925,"_type":"aimessage"}]
