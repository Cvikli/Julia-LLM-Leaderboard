[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an implementation of `q_and_a_extractor`. Note that this function assumes that each question is followed by its answer:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    current_section = :Question # We start in the Question section.\n    for line in lines\n        stripped_line = strip(line)\n        if current_section == :Question && startswith(stripped_line, \"# Answer\")\n            current_section = :Answer\n        elseif current_section == :Answer\n            break # We've reached the end of the Answer section. Stop processing lines.\n        elseif current_section == :Question\n            if stripped_line != \"\" && !startswith(stripped_line, \"#\")\n                question *= line\n        elseif current_section == :Answer\n            answer *= line\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function processes each line of the input `md`. If it is in a `:Question` section and encounters a line that starts with `# Answer`, it changes to the `:Answer` section. It stops processing lines when it reaches the end of the `:Answer` section, even if there are still lines in the original markdown.\n\nIf you want to handle cases where answers or questions span multiple lines, this function would need to be adjusted slightly to use a more sophisticated line-based parser or to use a different approach altogether.","status":200,"tokens":[98,356],"elapsed":2.880689345,"_type":"aimessage"}]
