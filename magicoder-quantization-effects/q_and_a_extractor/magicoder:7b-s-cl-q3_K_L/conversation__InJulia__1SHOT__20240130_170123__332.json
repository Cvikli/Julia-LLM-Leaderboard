Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it sets the appropriate boolean flags to indicate which section is being read. Then for all subsequent lines, it appends the text to either `question` or `answer` based on the flag state. The strip() function is used to remove leading spaces and newline characters from each line before adding them to the `question` or `answer`. Finally it returns a tuple containing the `question` and `answer` as strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,285],"elapsed":2.272716573,"_type":"aimessage"}]
