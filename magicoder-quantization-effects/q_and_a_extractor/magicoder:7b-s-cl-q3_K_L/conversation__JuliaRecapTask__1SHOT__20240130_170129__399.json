[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an implementation of the function:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md) \n    lines = split(strip(md), \"\\n\") # Split markdown into lines\n    \n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    isQuestion = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            isQuestion = false\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Question\") \n            isQuestion = true\n        elseif isQuestion\n            question *= line[4:end] # Skip the first four characters because they are \"    \"\n        elseif !isempty(question) && (answer == \"\" || line != answer[1])\n            answer *= line \n        end\n    end\n\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each line of the markdown text. If a line starts with \"# Question\", it sets `isQuestion` to true and continues reading until another `# Answer` is encountered, or until an empty line is reached. The question and answer are then returned after stripping any leading spaces and newlines.\n\nPlease make sure you have correctly formatted markdown in your input string and that there will always be a single '# Question' and '# Answer' pair for every section of the markdown file.","status":200,"tokens":[0,297],"elapsed":2.439639118,"_type":"aimessage"}]
