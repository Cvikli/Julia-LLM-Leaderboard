Note that `# Question` and `# Answer` should be at the beginning of a new line for this regular expression to match. If there are multiple sections with these titles, they will be combined into one question and answer string.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Answer\nThis is my answer.\n\n# Question\nThis is my question?\n\n# Answer\nThis is another answer.\n\"\"\"\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(md)) # prints (\"This is my question?\\n\\nThis is my answer.\", \"This is another answer.\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,356],"elapsed":2.857114511,"_type":"aimessage"}]
