Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can implement this function using Julia's regular expressions (`Regex`) and string manipulation functions:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = match(r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n# Answer\", md, re\"\")\n    answer = match(r\"# Answer\\n(.*)\", md, re\"\")\n    \n    if isnothing(question) || isnothing(answer)\n        throw(ErrorException(\"Invalid markdown format: Missing either question or answer.\"))\n    end\n\n    return (strip(question.captures[1]), strip(answer.captures[1]))\nend\n```\nIn this function, `match` is used to find the portions of the input string that match the regular expression patterns. If there are no matches, it will return `nothing`. The `.captures[1]` part gets the actual text from the matched pattern (not the whole match). Finally, `strip` is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from the captured texts. \n\nYou can call this function with a string of markdown formatted content as follows:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n    # Question\n    \n    What's your favorite language?\n    \n    # Answer\n    \n    My favorite language is Julia.\n    \"\"\"\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: \", question)\nprintln(\"Answer: \", answer)\n```\nThe function will return the tuple `(\"What's your favorite language?\", \"My favorite language is Julia.\")`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,358],"elapsed":2.87701109,"_type":"aimessage"}]
