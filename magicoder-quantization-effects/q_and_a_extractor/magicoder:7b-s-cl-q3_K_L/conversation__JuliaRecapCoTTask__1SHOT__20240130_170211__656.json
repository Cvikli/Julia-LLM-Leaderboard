[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem using Julia's standard libraries for parsing markdown and string manipulation: \n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    state = nothing\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            state = :question\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            state = :answer\n        elseif state == :question && !isempty(line)\n            question *= lstrip(line[2:end])\n        elseif state == :answer && !isempty(line)\n            answer *= lstrip(line[2:end])\n        end\n    end\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nYou can then use this function to extract the question and answer from a markdown string like so:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nThis is a test. What is your name? \n\n# Answer\nMy name is Julia. Nice to meet you!\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: \", question)\nprintln(\"Answer: \", answer)\n```\nThis will print out the extracted question and answer as strings. The function `q_and_a_extractor` works by iterating over each line in the input markdown string, checking if it's a question or an answer, and then appending to either the question or answer string accordingly. If you want to handle multiline answers/questions better, you could use a state machine or similar technique, but this function should work fine for most basic uses of Markdown in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[0,391],"elapsed":3.250703379,"_type":"aimessage"}]
