[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can define this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    state = :Question\n\n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        stripped_line = strip(line)\n        \n        if startswith(stripped_line, \"# Question\")\n            state = :Question\n        elseif startswith(stripped_line, \"# Answer\")\n            state = :Answer\n        end\n\n        if state == :Question && !isempty(question)\n            question *= stripped_line[end-length(question)+2:end]\n        elseif state == :Answer && !isempty(answer)\n            answer *= stripped_line[end-length(answer)+2:end]\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each line in the markdown text. If it encounters a line starting with \"# Question\", it switches to the \"Question\" state and starts recording the question. Similarly, if it encounters a line starting with \"# Answer\", it switches to the \"Answer\" state and starts recording the answer. It continues doing this until it has recorded both the question and answer. Finally, it returns these as a tuple.\n\nPlease remember that this function assumes your markdown text is formatted in a way where each question is followed immediately by its answer with a line starting with \"# Answer\". If this is not always true, you might need to adjust this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,363],"elapsed":2.906792079,"_type":"aimessage"}]
