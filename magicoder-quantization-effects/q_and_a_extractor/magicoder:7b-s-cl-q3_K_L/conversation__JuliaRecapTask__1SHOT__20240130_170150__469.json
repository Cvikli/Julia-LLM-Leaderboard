[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is an example of how you might implement `q_and_a_extractor` function in Julia programming language:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the input string into an array by lines\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    \n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    current = \"Question\"  # Start with Question section.\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            current = \"Answer\"\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            current = \"Question\"\n        elseif current == \"Question\" && !isempty(line)\n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif current == \"Answer\" && !isempty(line)\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes in a markdown string and splits it into lines. It then goes through each line. If the line is starting with \"# Answer\", then we switch to the \"Answer\" part. Same for \"# Question\". For all other lines in the \"Question\" part, we add them to our question string after stripping leading spaces. Similar process happens for answer part.\n\nYou can test this function with an example:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nThis is a sample question?\n\n# Answer\nThis is a sample answer! \n\"\"\"\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md)) # Outputs (\"This is a sample question?\",\"This is a sample answer!\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,370],"elapsed":3.046849082,"_type":"aimessage"}]
