[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can implement this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    current_section = \"\"\n\n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            current_section = \"Question\"\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            current_section = \"Answer\"\n        elseif current_section == \"Question\" && !isempty(line) \n            question *= line[2:end] # strip the leading '# ' in each line\n        elseif current_section == \"Answer\" && !isempty(line) \n            answer *= line[2:end] # strip the leading '# ' in each line\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function loops through each line of the input `md`. It checks if a line starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`. If it does, then it switches to the appropriate section. If the current section is \"Question\" and the line is not empty (which should be the content), it appends the content without the initial '# ' to the question string. Similarly for the answer section. After traversing all lines, it returns a tuple of stripped strings `(question,answer)`.\n  \nPlease note that this function assumes that each question and answer are separated by one or more lines of `# ...` (section header). If there is no such separation, you may need to modify the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,355],"elapsed":2.846448313,"_type":"aimessage"}]
