Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = re.findall('(?<=# Question\\n).*', md)\n    answer = re.findall('(?<=# Answer\\n).*', md)\n    \n    return (question[0].strip(), answer[0].strip())\n\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n\\n# Answer\\nThe capital of France is Paris.\"))\n```\nIn this solution, we use regular expressions to find the text between '# Question' and '# Answer'. The `re.findall` function returns all non-overlapping matches of pattern in string as a list of strings. We then strip leading spaces and newlines with the `.strip()` method.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes there is only one question and answer in the provided markdown text. If multiple questions or answers exist, we may need to modify this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,227],"elapsed":1.828249441,"_type":"aimessage"}]
