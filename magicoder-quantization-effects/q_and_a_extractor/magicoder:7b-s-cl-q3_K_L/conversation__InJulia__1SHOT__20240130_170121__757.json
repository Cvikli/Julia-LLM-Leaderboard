This function uses regular expressions (regex) to find sections labelled with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively. It then extracts all content between these markers, strips any leading spaces or newlines and returns a tuple containing both sections.\n\n```julia\nimport Base.strip\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Find question and answer using regex\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"# Question(.+?)\\n*# Answer\", md, seed=1))\n    if isempty(matches)\n        return (\"No section found.\", \"\")\n    end\n    \n    match = first(matches)  # get the first match\n    question = strip(match[1])\n    answer = strip(match[2])\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nYou can test this function with the following code:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nThis is a sample question. \n\n# Answer\nThis is a sample answer. \n\"\"\"\n@show q_and_a_extractor(md)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,263],"elapsed":2.099525925,"_type":"aimessage"}]
