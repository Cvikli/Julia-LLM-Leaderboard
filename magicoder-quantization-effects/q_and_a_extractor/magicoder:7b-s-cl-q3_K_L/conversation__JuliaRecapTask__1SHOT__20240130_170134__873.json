[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can use regular expressions to find sections of markdown with specific tags. Here's how we might implement this:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)::Tuple{AbstractString, AbstractString}\n    # Convert the markdown string into a Document object which is a vector of Block and Inline elements.\n    md_parsed = parse_markdown(md)\n  \n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    for block in md_parsed\n        if typeof(block) == Markdown.Header && startswith(string(block), \"# Question\")\n            question *= block.content\n        elseif typeof(block) == Markdown.Header && startswith(string(block), \"# Answer\")\n            answer *= block.content\n        end\n    end\n  \n    # Strip leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n    question = replace(question, r\"^[ \\t]*\\n?\" => \"\")\n    answer = replace(answer, r\"^[ \\t]*\\n?\" => \"\")\n  \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function goes through each block in the markdown string. If it encounters a header that starts with `# Question`, then it adds the content of that block to the `question` variable. Similarly if it encounters a header that starts with `# Answer`, it adds the content of that block to the `answer` variable.\n\nAfter finishing going through all blocks, it removes any leading spaces and newlines from both the question and answer strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,356],"elapsed":2.933881203,"_type":"aimessage"}]
