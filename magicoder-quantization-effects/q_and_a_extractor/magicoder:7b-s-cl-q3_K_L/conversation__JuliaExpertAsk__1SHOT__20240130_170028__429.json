It checks if the line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If it does, it sets a flag appropriately. Any text after these comments is added to either `question` or `answer`. Finally, it strips any leading spaces from both strings and returns them as a tuple.\n\nIt's important to note that this function assumes that the `# Question` and `# Answer` sections are single-line headers (i.e., no lines between these markers). If your markdown text might have lines between these markers, you would need a more sophisticated approach.","status":200,"tokens":[128,351],"elapsed":2.847458024,"_type":"aimessage"}]
