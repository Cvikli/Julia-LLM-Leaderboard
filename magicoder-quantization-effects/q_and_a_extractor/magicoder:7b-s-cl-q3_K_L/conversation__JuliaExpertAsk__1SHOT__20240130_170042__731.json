If it does, it extracts the relevant text and assigns to `question` or `answer`, respectively. The function then returns a tuple containing these two strings.\n\nNote: This implementation assumes that there is only one pair of `# Question` and `# Answer` in the input markdown string. If there can be multiple such pairs, this code needs to be adjusted accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,280],"elapsed":2.243245494,"_type":"aimessage"}]
