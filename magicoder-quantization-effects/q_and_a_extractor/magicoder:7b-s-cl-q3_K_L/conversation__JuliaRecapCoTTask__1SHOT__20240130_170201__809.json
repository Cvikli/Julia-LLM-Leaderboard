[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of a function `q_and_a_extractor` which solves this task:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString; instructions::AbstractString = \"\")\n    # split the markdown text by sections based on \"# \" at beginning of lines\n    sections = split(md, \"\\n# \", keepempty=false)\n    \n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    for section in sections\n        if startswith(section, \"Question\") || instructions == \"use_section\"  # for given case use_section is True\n            question = replace(strip(split(section, \"\\n\")[2]), ' ' => \" \")\n        elseif startswith(section, \"Answer\")\n            answer = replace(strip(split(section, \"\\n\")[2]), ' ' => \" \")\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function splits the given markdown string into sections based on `# ` at beginning of lines and then processes each section to extract the question or answer. It's important to note that this solution is quite basic and may not work in all cases, such as when the structure of the input markdown changes significantly from what's described here. \n\nThis function also checks for a special instruction \"use_section\" which allows it to process sections based on their titles instead of always assuming they follow the ordering \"# Question\" -> \"# Answer\". You would add this by setting `instructions = \"use_section\"` when calling the function, but please note that this would be a more sophisticated solution and may not work with all markdown-formatted texts.","status":200,"tokens":[0,374],"elapsed":3.087107323,"_type":"aimessage"}]
