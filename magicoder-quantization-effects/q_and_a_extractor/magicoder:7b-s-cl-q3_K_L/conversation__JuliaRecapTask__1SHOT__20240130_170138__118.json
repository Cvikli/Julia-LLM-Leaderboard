[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a sample implementation of `q_and_a_extractor` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestion = false\n    inAnswer = false\n    \n    for line in split(md, '\\n')\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\") \n            inQuestion = true\n            continue\n        elseif inQuestion && !startswith(line, \"## Answer\")\n            question *= replace(line[6:end], ' ' => \"\")\n        elseif inAnswer && !startswith(line, \"## \")\n            answer *= replace(line[4:end], ' ' => \"\")\n        end \n        \n        if startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inQuestion = false\n            inAnswer = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"## \") && !inAnswer\n            break\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n``` \n\nThis function works by iterating over each line in the markdown text. When it finds a line that starts with \"# Question\", it sets `inQuestion` to true and continues to the next line. Similarly, when it finds a line that starts with \"# Answer\", it sets `inAnswer` to true and continues to the next line. \n\nIf `inQuestion` is true and `inAnswer` is false and if it doesn't find any \"## \" in the line then it appends the text to the question string. Similarly, when `inAnswer` is true and it finds a line that starts with \"## \", it stops reading lines and returns the question and answer as a tuple.\n\nThis function assumes that the Question section ends with a single \"# Answer\" followed by the Answer section which can have multiple sections denoted by \"##\". It strips any leading spaces or newlines from the extracted text before concatenating to the respective strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,435],"elapsed":3.594544331,"_type":"aimessage"}]
