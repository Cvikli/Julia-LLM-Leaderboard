Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use the `split` function along with list indexing to solve this problem. Here's a simple Python solution:\n\n```python\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    lines = md.strip().split('\\n')\n    \n    question_started = False\n    answer_started = False\n    question = []\n    answer = []\n\n    for line in lines:\n        if line.startswith(\"# Question\"):\n            question_started = True\n            continue\n        \n        if line.startswith(\"# Answer\"):\n            answer_started = True\n            continue\n        \n        if question_started and not answer_started:\n            question.append(line.lstrip(' '))\n            \n        elif answer_started:\n            answer.append(line.lstrip(' '))\n    \n    return (' '.join(question), ' '.join(answer))\n```\nYou can test this function with the provided data like so:\n\n```python\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n# Answer\\nThe capital of France is Paris.\"))  # (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each line in the markdown text, and if it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it sets a flag accordingly. If it encounters lines that are not questions or answers but belong to the question or answer section (respectively), it appends them to the list of question or answer lines. Finally, it joins these lists into strings and returns a tuple containing the question and answer text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,380],"elapsed":6.615026393,"_type":"aimessage"}]
