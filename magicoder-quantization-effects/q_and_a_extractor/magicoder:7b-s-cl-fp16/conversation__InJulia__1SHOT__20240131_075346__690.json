Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

It then extracts the text of the Question and Answer sections and strips any leading spaces or newlines. The extracted question and answer are returned as a tuple. \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that there is only one section for each category (# Question and # Answer) in the markdown string, and that these sections are at the top level of the document. If your markdown has nested sections or if you want to extract text from other parts of the document, you would need a more complex approach.","status":200,"tokens":[0,236],"elapsed":4.103885222,"_type":"aimessage"}]
