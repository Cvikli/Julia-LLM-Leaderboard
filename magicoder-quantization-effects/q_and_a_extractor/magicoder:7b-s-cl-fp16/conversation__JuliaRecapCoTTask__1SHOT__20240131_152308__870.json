[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function that extracts the question and answer from the given markdown string:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    inQuestionSection = false\n    inAnswerSection = false\n    questionLines = String[]\n    answerLines = String[]\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestionSection = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inQuestionSection = false\n            inAnswerSection = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if inQuestionSection\n            push!(questionLines, line)\n        elseif inAnswerSection\n            push!(answerLines, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    question = join(questionLines, \" \") |> strip  # remove leading/trailing spaces and newlines\n    answer = join(answerLines, \" \") |> strip\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by first splitting the input string into lines. Then it iterates through each line. If a line starts with \"# Question\", it sets `inQuestionSection` to true and continues. Similarly, if a line starts with \"# Answer\", it sets `inAnswerSection` to true and continues. All other lines are added to the respective section (question or answer). Finally, it joins all the lines in each section into one string with no leading/trailing spaces and newlines using the join function and returns this as a tuple. \n\nPlease note that this is a simple solution and does not handle more complex markdown structures, such as nested sections or additional formatting. For a comprehensive solution, you might want to use a library designed for parsing markdown in Julia, such as Markdown.jl.","status":200,"tokens":[11,403],"elapsed":7.090060945,"_type":"aimessage"}]
