[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, we can solve this problem using regular expressions to find the sections \"Question\" and \"Answer\". We can then use `strip` method to remove any leading spaces or newlines. \n\nHere's a basic implementation:\n```julia\nimport REGEX\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    m = REGEX.match(r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n# Answer\\n(.*?)[\\n#|\\Z]\", md)\n    return strip.(split(m.captures, '\\n')) \nend\n```\nThis function will find the \"Question\" and \"Answer\" sections from the markdown text `md`, remove leading spaces or newlines using the `strip` method and return them in a tuple. This solution assumes that there's at most one \"Question\" section followed by exactly one \"Answer\" section, and each is separated by two newlines.\n\nIf you want to make your function more robust (i.e., it should still work even if the input text does not strictly follow this structure), you might need a more complex implementation involving multiple passes over `md` or additional parsing logic:\n```julia\nimport REGEX\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    m = REGEX.match(r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n# Answer\\n(.*?)(?=\\n#|\\Z)\", md, capture=true, greedy=false)\n    return strip.(split(m.captures, '\\n')) \nend\n```\nThis implementation will be more robust since it doesn't depend on the input text to strictly follow a certain structure. It also allows for multiple \"Question\" and/or \"Answer\" sections in the markdown text `md`.\n\nThe function should work for any valid markdown text, provided that the text starts with \"# Question\" followed by some content and ends with \"# Answer\". For instance: \n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nHow do you pronounce Julia?\n# Answer\nYou can say \"JU-lee-ah\" or \"Yoo Leen Ah\", depending on your dialect.\n\"\"\"\n\nq_and_a_extractor(md)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,489],"elapsed":8.655971734,"_type":"aimessage"}]
