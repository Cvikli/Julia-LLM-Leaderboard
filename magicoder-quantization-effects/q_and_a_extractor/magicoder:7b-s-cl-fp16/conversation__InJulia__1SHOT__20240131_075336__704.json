[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could solve this problem using Julia's `eachmatch` function to find all matches of the regex pattern for `# Question` and `# Answer`, and then extracting the text between those markers:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    # Find all lines starting with '# Question' or '# Answer'\n    matches = eachmatch(r\"^# (Question|Answer)\", md)\n    \n    # Extract the text between these markers\n    for match in matches\n        if match.match == \"# Question\"\n            question *= strip(md[lastindex(question)+1:match.offset])\n        elseif match.match == \"# Answer\"\n            answer *= strip(md[lastindex(answer)+1:match.offset])\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function will return a tuple containing the extracted question and answer text. Note that it assumes that each `# Question` or `# Answer` is on its own line without any leading spaces or newlines. If there are multiple lines of text between these markers, this function will concatenate them together. \n\nIf you need to handle cases where there might be additional whitespace or newlines before the `# Question` or `# Answer`, you would need a more complex solution that can parse markdown syntax.","status":200,"tokens":[0,312],"elapsed":5.396419144,"_type":"aimessage"}]
