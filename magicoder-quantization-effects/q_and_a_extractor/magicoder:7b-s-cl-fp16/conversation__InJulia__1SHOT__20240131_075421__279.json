[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might implement this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in split(md, '\\n')\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if in_question && !startswith(line, \" \")\n            question *= line[2:end]\n        elseif in_answer && !startswith(line, \" \")\n            answer *= line[2:end]\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each line of the markdown string. If it encounters a line that starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`, it sets the corresponding flag and continues to the next line. Otherwise, if the current line is not blank and the flags are set, it appends the text to the appropriate variable after stripping any leading spaces.\n\nNote: This function assumes that each question and answer section is on a single line and does not handle nested sections or other complex markdown structures. If you need to process more complex markdown, you may want to use a library designed for parsing markdown.","status":200,"tokens":[0,324],"elapsed":5.607917453,"_type":"aimessage"}]
