It then strips any leading spaces or newlines from each section before concatenating them into strings for the questions and answers, respectively. If no matches are found in the markdown text, it returns an empty string for both question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,358],"elapsed":6.252428779,"_type":"aimessage"}]
