Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple solution to extract the question and answer from the given markdown formatted string in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\", keepempty=false)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestion = false\n    inAnswer = false\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestion = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inAnswer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if inQuestion && !isempty(line)\n            question *= line[2:end]\n        elseif inAnswer && !isempty(line)\n            answer *= line[2:end]\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the input markdown string into lines, then iterating over each line. If it encounters a line starting with \"# Question\", it sets `inQuestion` to true and continues to the next line. Similarly, if it encounters a line starting with \"# Answer\", it sets `inAnswer` to true and continues to the next line. For any other lines, it appends the text to either `question` or `answer`, depending on whether we are currently inside a question or answer section (as indicated by `inQuestion` and `inAnswer`). Finally, it returns a tuple of the stripped strings for the question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,343],"elapsed":5.976329069,"_type":"aimessage"}]
