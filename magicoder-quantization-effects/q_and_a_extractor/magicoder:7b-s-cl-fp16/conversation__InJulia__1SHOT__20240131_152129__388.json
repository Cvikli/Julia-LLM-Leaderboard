[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might approach this problem using Julia's regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = match(r\"# Question(.*?)(?=\\n\\n|\\Z)\", md, re.MULTILINE | re.DOTALL)\n    answer = match(r\"# Answer(.*?)(?=\\n\\n|\\Z)\", md, re.MULTILINE | re.DOTALL)\n    \n    if question !== nothing && answer !== nothing\n        return (strip(question.captures[1]), strip(answer.captures[1]))\n    else\n        return (\"No Question or Answer found\", \"No Question or Answer found\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find the text between `# Question` and a new line, or the end of the string (`\\Z`). The `?=` operator makes it non-greedy (it will stop at the first match), and `.` matches any character. The `(re.MULTILINE | re.DOTALL)` flags make sure that the dot (`.`) also matches newlines and the function returns all text until a newline followed by two newlines or the end of the string.\n\nNote: This function assumes that there is exactly one question and answer per markdown file, and each section starts with `# Question` for the question and `# Answer` for the answer. If this isn't the case, you may need to adjust the regular expressions or add more logic to handle multiple questions/answers or missing sections.\n\nAlso, this function doesn't handle nested questions/answers well (it will stop at the first closing section it sees), so if your markdown has any complex structures you might want to use a proper markdown parser instead of regex.","status":200,"tokens":[0,398],"elapsed":6.889216825,"_type":"aimessage"}]
