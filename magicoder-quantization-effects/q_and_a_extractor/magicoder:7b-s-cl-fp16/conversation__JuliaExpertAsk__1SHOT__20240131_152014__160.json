Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of `q_and_a_extractor` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question *= line[12:end] # strip \"# Question\"\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer *= line[10:end] # strip \"# Answer\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function splits the input string `md` into lines and iterates over each line. If a line starts with `# Question`, it appends to the question variable after stripping \"# Question\". Same for `# Answer`. The result is returned as a tuple of strings, stripped of leading spaces and newlines.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no other sections in your markdown text and that every section starts with `#` followed by the name of the section (either \"Question\" or \"Answer\"). If such assumptions do not hold true, you would need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[128,276],"elapsed":4.780876206,"_type":"aimessage"}]
