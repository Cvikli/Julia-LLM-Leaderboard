Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can accomplish this using regular expressions in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = matchall(r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n\", md)\n    answer = matchall(r\"# Answer\\n(.*?)\\n\", md)\n    \n    # Strip leading spaces and newlines\n    question = map(strip, question)\n    answer = map(strip, answer)\n\n    return (question[1], answer[1])\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to match the text between `# Question` and the next line break, and between `# Answer` and the next line break. The `map` function is used to apply the `strip` function to each element of the resulting arrays (which are tuples).\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there will be exactly one question and answer in the input markdown text. If there may be multiple questions or answers, you should modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,224],"elapsed":3.871634955,"_type":"aimessage"}]
