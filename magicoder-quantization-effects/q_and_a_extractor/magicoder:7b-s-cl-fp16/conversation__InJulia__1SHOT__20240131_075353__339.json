[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you might solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n        elseif in_question && !startswith(line, \" \")\n            question *= line\n            in_question = false\n        elseif in_answer && !startswith(line, \" \")\n            answer *= line\n            in_answer = false\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the markdown text into lines and then iterating over each line. If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\", it sets `in_question` to true, meaning that any subsequent non-indented lines are part of the question. Similarly for \"# Answer\". Any other lines are added to the current section (either question or answer), and if they start with a space (which would indicate an indented line in markdown), they're not added to the current section. The `strip` function is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that each `# Question` and `# Answer` pair are on separate lines, with no other text between them. If there could be other text in between, you would need a more complex solution.","status":200,"tokens":[0,371],"elapsed":6.424641208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
