[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is a simple implementation of your request using Julia's regular expression and parsing capabilities:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question = matchall(r\"# Question(.*?)(?=\\n##|\\Z)\", md; flags=re.I | re.MULTILINE)\n    answer = matchall(r\"# Answer(.*?)(?=\\n##|\\Z)\", md; flags=re.I | re.MULTILINE)\n    \n    # strip leading newlines, spaces and trailing empty elements from arrays\n    question = mapreduce(strip, (x)->isempty(x), question)[2:end]\n    answer = mapreduce(strip, (x)->isempty(x), answer)[2:end]\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expression to match all the sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively. It then strip leading spaces and newlines from these matched text using `strip`. The extracted texts are returned in a tuple like `(question, answer)`.\n\nRemember that this solution assumes that the markdown format is consistent with your provided examples (i.e., each `# Question` and `# Answer` starts on its own line, followed by the question/answer text). If there can be other lines of text between these sections or other variations in the markdown format, you may need a more sophisticated approach to parsing this data.","status":200,"tokens":[98,325],"elapsed":5.669678124,"_type":"aimessage"}]
