[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use regular expressions to extract the desired sections of the markdown text. Here is how you can define `q_and_a_extractor` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    # Find start and end indices for each section\n    question_start = findfirst(occurrences -> occurrences[1] == \"# Question\", md.content)\n    answer_start = findfirst(occurrences -> occurrences[1] == \"# Answer\", md.content)\n    \n    # If no question or answer found, return nothing\n    if question_start === nothing || answer_start === nothing\n        return nothing\n    end\n    \n    # Extract and strip leading spaces and newlines from the sections\n    question = replace(md.content[question_start+1:answer_start-1], r\"^[\\t ]*\" => \"\")\n    answer = replace(md.content[answer_start+1:end], r\"^[\\t ]*\" => \"\")\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first finds the starting indices of each section in the markdown text using `findfirst` function with a regular expression that matches lines starting with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". Then it extracts and strips any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted sections. If no question or answer found, it returns nothing.\n\nPlease note this assumes that there are exactly one `# Question` and one `# Answer` in `md`. If there can be multiple such sections, you would need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,350],"elapsed":6.124476056,"_type":"aimessage"}]
