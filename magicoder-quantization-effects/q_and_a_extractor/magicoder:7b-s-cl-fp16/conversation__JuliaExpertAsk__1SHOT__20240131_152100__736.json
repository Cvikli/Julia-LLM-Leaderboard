When it finds these, it toggles a flag to indicate whether we're currently in a question or an answer. It then appends the line of text (minus any leading spaces and newline) to the appropriate variable based on which section we're currently in.\n\nFinally, it returns a tuple containing the stripped text for the question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,319],"elapsed":5.52186619,"_type":"aimessage"}]
