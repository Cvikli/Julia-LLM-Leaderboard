Here's how you could define this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)::Tuple{String, String}\n    blocks = split(md, \"\\n\\n\") # Split the markdown text into sections\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestion = false\n    for block in blocks \n        lines = split(block, '\\n')\n        if startswith(lines[1], \"# Question\")\n            inQuestion = true\n            continue\n        end\n        if startswith(lines[1], \"# Answer\")\n            inQuestion = false\n            continue\n        end\n        if inQuestion \n            question *= join(lines, ' ')\n        else\n            answer *= join(lines, ' ')\n        end\n    end\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function splits the markdown into blocks at each empty line (`\\n\\n`). Then, it iterates through these blocks. If a block starts with `# Question`, it sets `inQuestion` to true and skips that block. Likewise for `# Answer`. When in a question block, it joins all lines of the block (with spaces) into `question`. Similarly, when not in a question block (i.e., in an answer block), it joins all lines into `answer`. Finally, it returns both the stripped `question` and `answer`.\n  \nThe function uses the `strip()` method to remove any leading or trailing white spaces from strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,371],"elapsed":6.533103087,"_type":"aimessage"}]
