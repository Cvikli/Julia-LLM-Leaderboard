Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is a Julia function that uses regular expressions to extract the question and answer from the markdown text:\n\n```julia\nimport Base.strip\n\nfunction strip(s::AbstractString)\n    return replace(s, r\"\\n|\\r\" => \"\")\nend\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    m = match(r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n# Answer\\n(.*)\", md)\n    \n    if m === nothing  # If the pattern doesn't match, return an empty string for each component.\n        return (\"\", \"\")\n    else\n        question_str = strip(m[1])\n        answer_str = strip(m[2])\n        \n        return (question_str, answer_str)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function will return a tuple where the first element is the extracted question and the second element is the extracted answer. If the markdown text does not follow the required format, it returns an empty string for both components. The `strip` function is used to remove any leading spaces or newlines from the extracted text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,246],"elapsed":4.306370856,"_type":"aimessage"}]
