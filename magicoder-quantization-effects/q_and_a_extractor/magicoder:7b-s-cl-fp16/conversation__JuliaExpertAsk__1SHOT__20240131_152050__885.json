Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can define such function using Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = ''\n    answer = ''\n    \n    lines = md.split('\\n')\n    for line in lines:\n        if line.startswith('# Question'):\n            question += line[10:] + '\\n'\n        elif line.startswith('# Answer'):\n            answer += line[8:] + '\\n'\n            \n    return (re.sub(r'\\s+', ' ', question).strip(), \n            re.sub(r'\\s+', ' ', answer).strip())\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the markdown text into lines and iterating over each line. If a line starts with '# Question' or '# Answer', it appends the rest of the line to either `question` or `answer`. It then returns a tuple of strings after removing leading spaces, newlines, and excessive whitespace from both questions and answers.\n\nNote: This function assumes that each section (Question and Answer) is on its own line with no other text before or after it. If the markdown might have additional text in between sections, you would need to adjust this code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,272],"elapsed":4.70196189,"_type":"aimessage"}]
