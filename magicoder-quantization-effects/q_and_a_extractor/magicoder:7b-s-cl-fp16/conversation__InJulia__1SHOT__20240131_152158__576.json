If it encounters a line starting with `# Question`, it starts recording the question. Similarly, if it encounters a line starting with `# Answer`, it stops recording the question and starts recording the answer. It then appends each non-empty line to either the question or the answer based on whether it's currently recording the question or the answer. The `strip` function is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from the text.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is your name?\n\n# Answer\nMy name is Julia.\n\"\"\"\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md))  # Output: (\"What is your name?\", \"My name is Julia.\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,400],"elapsed":6.923596407,"_type":"aimessage"}]
