Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might implement this function using Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = None\n    answer = None\n    \n    lines = md.split('\\n')\n    for i in range(len(lines)):\n        if lines[i].startswith('# Question'):\n            question = ''\n            while not re.match('^#', lines[i+1]):\n                question += lines[i+1].lstrip() + '\\n'\n                i += 1\n            question = question.rstrip()\n        elif lines[i].startswith('# Answer'):\n            answer = ''\n            while not re.match('^#', lines[i+1]):\n                answer += lines[i+1].lstrip() + '\\n'\n                i += 1\n            answer = answer.rstrip()\n            \n    return question, answer\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the markdown text into individual lines and iterating over these lines. If it encounters a line starting with `# Question`, it starts collecting all subsequent lines that don't start with `#` as the question text. Similarly for the answer section. The extracted texts are then returned in a tuple.\n\nPlease note, this function assumes that there is only one question and one answer in the markdown text. If there can be multiple questions or answers, you would need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,323],"elapsed":5.579939045,"_type":"aimessage"}]
