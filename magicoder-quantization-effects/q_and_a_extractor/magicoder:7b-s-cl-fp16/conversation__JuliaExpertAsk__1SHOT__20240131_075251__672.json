Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could implement this function using Julia's built-in string manipulation functions:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_question && !isempty(line)\n            question *= line[end] == ' ' ? line[2:end-1] : line\n        elseif in_answer && !isempty(line)\n            answer *= line[end] == ' ' ? line[2:end-1] : line\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the markdown text into lines and then iterating over each line. If a line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it sets the corresponding flag to true and continues to the next line. If the question or answer flags are set and the current line is not empty, it appends the line's content (after removing leading spaces) to the question or answer string respectively. Finally, it returns a tuple of stripped strings for the question and answer.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there will be no other lines starting with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", and that the question and answer sections are not nested within each other. If your markdown text can have these complexities, you may need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,396],"elapsed":6.865973715,"_type":"aimessage"}]
