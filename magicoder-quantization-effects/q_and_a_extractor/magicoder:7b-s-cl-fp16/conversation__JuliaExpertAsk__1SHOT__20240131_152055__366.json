Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

It does the same for `# Answer`.\n\nThe `.strip()` function is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text. If no question or answer is found, the function returns `(\"No Question or Answer found\", \"\")` as a fallback. \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that there will be at most one `# Question` and `# Answer` in your markdown document. If there are multiple questions/answers, you might want to modify this code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,305],"elapsed":5.304331076,"_type":"aimessage"}]
