[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function `q_and_a_extractor` that can extract the question and answer from the markdown text:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestionSection = false\n    inAnswerSection = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestionSection = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inQuestionSection = false\n            inAnswerSection = true\n        end\n        \n        if inQuestionSection && !isempty(line)\n            question *= line[end] == ' ' ? line[2:end-1] : line\n        elseif inAnswerSection && !isempty(line)\n            answer *= line[end] == ' ' ? line[2:end-1] : line\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each line in the markdown text. If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\", it sets `inQuestionSection` to true and continues reading lines until it encounters a line starting with \"# Answer\". It then sets `inAnswerSection` to true and reads lines into the answer variable until it encounters another line starting with \"# Question\" or reaches the end of the markdown text.\n\nThe function also checks if the last character in each line is a space, and if so, removes it before appending the line to the question or answer string. This is done because markdown syntax often includes an extra space at the beginning of lines following headers.","status":200,"tokens":[0,387],"elapsed":6.771583568,"_type":"aimessage"}]
