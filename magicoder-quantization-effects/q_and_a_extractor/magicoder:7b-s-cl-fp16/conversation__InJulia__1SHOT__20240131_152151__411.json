[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example function that accomplishes this task using regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    for (i, line) in enumerate(split(md, '\\n'))\n        if match(r\"^# Question\", line) !== nothing\n            question = replace(line[10:end], r\"\\s*\" => \"\")\n        elseif match(r\"^# Answer\", line) !== nothing\n            answer = replace(line[9:end], r\"\\s*\" => \"\")\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function splits the markdown text into lines and iterates through each line. If a line matches the pattern for a question or an answer, it extracts the relevant text and removes any leading spaces or newlines. Finally, it returns a tuple with the extracted question and answer.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes the format of your markdown is exactly as you described. If the format varies in some way, you would need to adjust the regular expressions used here.","status":200,"tokens":[0,260],"elapsed":4.496380624,"_type":"aimessage"}]
