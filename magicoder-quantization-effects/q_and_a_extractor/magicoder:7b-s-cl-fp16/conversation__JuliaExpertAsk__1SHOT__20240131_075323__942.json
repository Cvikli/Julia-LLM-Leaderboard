Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

The `re.DOTALL` flag is used to make `.` in the regex match any character including newline. \n\nThe extracted text is then stripped of leading spaces and newlines using `strip()`. If no matching text is found, an empty string is returned.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```python\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nThis is the question section.\n\nSome more details about the question...\n\n# Answer\nThis is the answer section.\n\nSome more details about the answer...\n\"\"\"\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(md))  # Output: ('This is the question section.\\n\\nSome more details about the question...', 'This is the answer section.\\n\\nSome more details about the answer...')\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,356],"elapsed":6.166424837,"_type":"aimessage"}]
