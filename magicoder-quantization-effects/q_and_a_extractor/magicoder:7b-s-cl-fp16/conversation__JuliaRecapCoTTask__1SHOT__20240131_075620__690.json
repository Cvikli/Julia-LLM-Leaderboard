[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple solution using regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    md = replace(md, \"\\r\\n\" => \"\\n\") # Normalize line endings\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    \n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_question && !isempty(line)\n            question *= line[2:end] # Strip leading space\n        elseif in_answer && !isempty(line)\n            answer *= line[2:end] # Strip leading space\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each line of the markdown text. If a line starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`, it toggles the `in_question` and `in_answer` flags, indicating whether we are currently processing a question or an answer. Any subsequent lines that do not start with `#` are appended to the current section (after stripping any leading spaces).\n\nThe function finally returns a tuple of the processed question and answer text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,335],"elapsed":5.884188738,"_type":"aimessage"}]
