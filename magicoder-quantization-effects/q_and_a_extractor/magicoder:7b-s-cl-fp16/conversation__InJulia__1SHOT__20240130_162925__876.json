It checks if the current line is a question or an answer by checking for the specific tags, and toggles `in_question` or `in_answer` accordingly. Then it checks if the current line is a non-empty line that doesn't start with a space (to avoid leading spaces and newlines), and if so, adds its content to the question or answer string respectively. The function returns a tuple containing the stripped version of both the question and answer strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,313],"elapsed":5.450675593,"_type":"aimessage"}]
