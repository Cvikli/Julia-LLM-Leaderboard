[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of such function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    \n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))  # iterate over lines in the markdown string.\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_question \n            question *= strip(line) # add the line to the question.\n        elseif in_answer \n            answer *= strip(line) # add the line to the answer.\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function reads through each line of the markdown string using `eachline` iterator and checks for lines starting with `# Question` or `# Answer`. If it finds such a line, it starts collecting text until another line indicating the start of either section is found. It then returns the collected question and answer as a tuple. \n\nFor extraction of questions and answers from markdown files, we can use the `Merkle.jl` package which provides tools for parsing Markdown. However, this library requires that you install Julia in your system first. Here is an example how to use it:\n\n```julia\nusing Merkle\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(file::AbstractString)\n    tree = parse_markdown(read(file, String))\n    \n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    for child in tree.children\n        if is_heading(child) && startswith(text(child), \"Question\") \n            question *= text(child)[9:end] # strip the \"# Question\" part\n        elseif is_heading(child) && startswith(text(child), \"Answer\") \n            answer *= text(child)[8:end] # strip the \"# Answer\" part\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,495],"elapsed":8.764939519,"_type":"aimessage"}]
