If a line is a question or an answer, it sets the corresponding boolean variable to `true`. For all other lines, if both booleans are `true`, it appends the line's text (excluding the first character which is '#') to the respective part of the output tuple. Finally, it returns the tuple with leading and trailing spaces removed.","status":200,"tokens":[98,302],"elapsed":5.223915706,"_type":"aimessage"}]
