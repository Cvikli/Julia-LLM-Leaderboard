[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could approach this task:\n\n```julia\nimport Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(replace(md, \"\\r\\n\" => \"\\n\"), '\\n') # remove windows line endings\n    \n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_question && !startswith(line, \"## \")\n            question *= line[2:end] # remove first character (#)\n        elseif in_answer && !startswith(line, \"## \")\n            answer *= line[2:end]  # remove first character (#)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return strip(question), strip(answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each line of the markdown string. If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\", it sets `in_question` to true and continues to the next line. Similarly, if it encounters a line that starts with \"# Answer\", it sets `in_answer` to true and continues to the next line. For any other lines, it checks whether it's in the question or answer block by checking the value of `in_question` and `in_answer`. If it is in one of these blocks and the line does not start with \"## \", it appends the content to the appropriate variable after removing the first character (#). Finally, it returns the stripped versions of the question and answer.\n\nPlease replace {{instructions}} with your specific instructions.","status":200,"tokens":[0,413],"elapsed":7.24166725,"_type":"aimessage"}]
