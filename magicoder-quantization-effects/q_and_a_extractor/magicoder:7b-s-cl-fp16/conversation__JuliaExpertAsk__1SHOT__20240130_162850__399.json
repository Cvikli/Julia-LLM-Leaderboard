Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

The first list `question` contains all the text between `# Question` and `# Answer`. Similarly, the second list `answer` contains all the text after `# Answer`. Note that this solution assumes that there is only one question per markdown file, and likewise for answers.","status":200,"tokens":[0,233],"elapsed":4.059354858,"_type":"aimessage"}]
