The `?=` operator inside the brackets is a positive lookahead, which means it will stop matching when it finds the next pattern (in this case, `# Answer` or end of string).\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```python\nmd = \"\"\"# Question\nThis is my question.\n# Answer\nThis is my answer.\"\"\"\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(md))  # Output: ('This is my question.', 'This is my answer.')\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,260],"elapsed":4.570160596,"_type":"aimessage"}]
