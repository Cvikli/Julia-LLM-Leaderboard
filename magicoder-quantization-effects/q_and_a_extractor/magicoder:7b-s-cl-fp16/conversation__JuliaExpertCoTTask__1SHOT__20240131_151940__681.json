If it does, it sets a flag accordingly. Then it appends the line to either the question or answer string depending on which flag is set. Finally, it trims any leading spaces and newlines from both strings before returning them as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,261],"elapsed":4.532410974,"_type":"aimessage"}]
