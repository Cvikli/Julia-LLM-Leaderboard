Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem using Julia's regular expressions and string manipulation features. Here's a simple implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = strip(matchall(r\"# Question\\n(.*?)(?=\\n# Answer|\\Z)\", md).captures[1])\n    answer = strip(matchall(r\"# Answer\\n(.*?)(?=\\n# Question|\\Z)\", md).captures[1])\n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `matchall` function from the `Regex` module to find all occurrences of text between `# Question` and `# Answer`, then `strip`s leading newlines and spaces. It does this twice - once for each section (`# Question` or `# Answer`) - which ensures that leading/trailing whitespaces are removed from both sections, regardless of their order in the input string.\n\nThe regular expression `r\"# Question\\n(.*?)(?=\\n# Answer|\\Z)\"` matches the text after `# Question`, and `r\"# Answer\\n(.*?)(?=\\n# Question|\\Z)\"` matches the text after `# Answer`. The `\\n` in these patterns is used to denote newline characters, and `.*` is a wildcard that matches any character (except for a newline), while `*` means \"zero or more of the preceding element\".\nThe `|` character denotes either the preceding expression (`# Question`) or the following one (`Answer`). The `\\Z` in this pattern stands for end of string. The `(?=...)` is known as positive lookahead, and it is used to find matches that are followed by certain conditions but doesn't include those conditions in the actual matched text.","status":200,"tokens":[272,384],"elapsed":28.22097541,"_type":"aimessage"}]
