If it is, it changes the `flag` variable to true or false respectively. Any other lines are added to `question` for Question sections and to `answer` for Answer sections, stripped of leading spaces and newline characters using the `strip()` function. The function returns the question and answer as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,243],"elapsed":1.913289777,"_type":"aimessage"}]
