Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution in Julia using Regular Expressions:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Regex\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question_match = match(r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n# Answer\", md, dotall=true)\n    if question_match === nothing\n        error(\"No question found.\")\n    end\n    question = replace(question_match[1], r\"\\s*^|\\n\" => \"\")\n    \n    answer_match = match(r\"# Answer\\n(.*?)\\n\", md, dotall=true)\n    if answer_match === nothing\n        error(\"No answer found.\")\n    end\n    answer = replace(answer_match[1], r\"\\s*^|\\n\" => \"\")\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by matching the entire markdown text using a single regular expression. The `(.*?)` part of the regex matches any character (`.*`) but the fewest possible repetitions (`?`); this is necessary to avoid matching more than one set of question/answer pairs in the input string.\n\nIn Julia, `match(r\"pattern\", text, dotall=true)` will return `nothing` if there's no match; otherwise it returns a Match object containing the matched text. To extract the matched text we can then use indexing (`match[1]`) to get the first subgroup of our regex (in this case the `.*?` inside the `# Question` and `# Answer` sections).\n\nNote: This function assumes there's exactly one set of question/answer pairs in the input string. It will return an error if these conditions aren't met.","status":200,"tokens":[0,381],"elapsed":3.082591366,"_type":"aimessage"}]
