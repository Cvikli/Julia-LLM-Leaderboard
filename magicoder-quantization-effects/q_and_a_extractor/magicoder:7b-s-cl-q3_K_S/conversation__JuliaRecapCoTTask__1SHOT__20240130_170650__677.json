[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

This function uses a state machine to track when we are inside either of the two sections, then it extracts all the content until the next section header (assuming there is only one level of headers). It returns a tuple with the question and answer extracted from this text.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(md,\"\\n\")\n    question,answer= \"\", \"\"\n    current_section = :Question\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"## Question\") \n            current_section = :Answer\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"## Answer\")\n            current_section = :End \n            continue\n        elseif current_section == :Question && !isempty(line)\n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif current_section == :Answer && !isempty(line)\n            answer *= strip(line)\n    end\n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nRemember that this function assumes each section begins with the corresponding title (\"## Question\", \"## Answer\") and ends once it finds another section's title or the end of the markdown. If your markdown has a different structure than this, you may need to modify this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,298],"elapsed":2.427813814,"_type":"aimessage"}]
