[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise. You're precise and answer only when you're confident in the high quality of your answer.","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Question\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of such function:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question = chomp(split(line, '# Question')[2])\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer = chomp(split(line, '# Answer')[2])\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nThis function splits the markdown text into lines and then checks each line for the keywords. If a line contains \"# Question\" it removes that part from the line and saves the remaining part as question. Similarly, if a line contains \"# Answer\", it saves everything after that in answer. It stops saving when both question and answer are not empty anymore.\n\nPlease note this function assumes the input is well-formatted i.e., the keywords are present only once for each question/answer block and they appear before any indented lines of the code block. The keywords should be at the start of the line, followed by a space and then the actual text. If your markdown may not always follow these rules you need to add error checking or enhance the function according to your specific needs.","status":200,"tokens":[0,295],"elapsed":2.337694483,"_type":"aimessage"}]
