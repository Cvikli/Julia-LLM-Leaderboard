Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could write this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question=false\n    in_answer=false\n    \n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            continue\n        elseif in_question && !startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            question *= line[6:end] # exclude the first 5 characters (# Question )\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer *= line[7:end] # exclude the first 6 characters (# Answer )\n            in_answer = true\n        elseif in_question && in_answer && !startswith(line, \"#\")\n            answer *= line\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return strip(question), strip(answer)\nend\n```\n\nIn the above function, we read each line of the input string `md` and if it's a question or an answer append the rest of the line after '# ' to the corresponding variable (question or answer). The `startswith` function tests if a string starts with another string. If a line is neither a question nor an answer, we assume that it belongs to the previous section and append it to the answer string.\n\nAfter all lines are processed, we strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text using the `strip` function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,347],"elapsed":2.74313695,"_type":"aimessage"}]
