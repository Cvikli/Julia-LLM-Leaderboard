[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you can achieve this:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    sections = split(md, \"# \")[2:end] # Split the markdown into sections and ignore first empty section\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    in_question, in_answer = false, false \n\n    for sec in sections\n        lines = split(sec, '\\n') # Split each section by newline\n        for line in lines\n            if startswith(line, \"# Question\") # Start of question\n                in_question = true\n                continue  # Skip to next line\n            elseif in_question && !startswith(line, \"# Answer\") # Part of the question\n                question *= strip(line) # Strip leading spaces and append to question\n            elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\") # Start of answer\n                if !isempty(question)  # Question has already started\n                    error(\"Answer section started before question in markdown.\")\n                end\n                in_answer = true\n                continue  # Skip to next line\n            elseif in_answer && !startswith(line, \"# \") # Part of the answer\n                answer *= strip(line) # Strip leading spaces and append to answer\n            elseif !isempty(line) # End of section (can only be question or answer)\n                error(\"Unexpected text in markdown after Answer section: $(line)\") \n            end\n        end\n        if isempty(question) || isempty(answer)\n            error(\"Missing complete Question and/or Answer section.\")\n        else\n            return (question, answer) # Return the question and answer\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by looping over each line of the markdown. If a line starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`, it switches a flag on or off, indicating whether it's reading in a question or an answer respectively. It continues to read lines until it encounters another section header or end of file, at which point it returns the assembled question and answer strings. If these sections are missing, an error is thrown.\n\nThe instructions special section can be processed separately if needed as well. You can add logic based on the {{instructions}} passed into function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,520],"elapsed":4.258055632,"_type":"aimessage"}]
