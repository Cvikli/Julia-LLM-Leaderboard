We override `handle_starttag` to determine which sections of the markdown are questions and answers by checking for tags with IDs starting with \"Question\" or \"Answer\". For data between these tags, we overwrite `handle_data`. After parsing the markdown string using `markdown.markdown(md)`, we return the extracted question and answer as a tuple. \n\nNote: This is a simplified solution. In real cases, the problem might be more complex like different languages (like French) or additional metadata that you would need to handle correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,490],"elapsed":3.962522355,"_type":"aimessage"}]
