It then extracts and joins all the subsequent lines as the question or answer. Please note that if there are multiple questions/answers in the provided markdown, this script will only pick the first pair it encounters.\n\nYou can use this function by passing a string of the following form:\n```markdown\n# Question\nSome text about the question...\n\n# Answer\nSome text about the answer...\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,374],"elapsed":2.955461485,"_type":"aimessage"}]
