Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you could implement this function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    lines = md.split('\\n')\n    \n    question = None\n    answer = []\n    for line in lines:\n        if line.strip().startswith('# Answer'):\n            break\n        elif line.strip().startswith('# Question'):\n            question = ''\n        elif question is not None and len(line) > 0:\n            question += ' ' + line.lstrip()\n        elif question is not None and answer == []:\n            continue # ignore additional whitespace after '# Question'\n        else:\n            answer.append(line.lstrip())\n    return (question.strip(), '\\n'.join(answer).strip())\n``` \nThis function works by splitting the input markdown `md` into lines, then iterating over each line. If a line starts with '# Answer', it breaks out of the loop to stop processing lines. If a line starts with '# Question', it records this as the question section and resets the answer list for the following lines. All other lines are added to the answer list until the next line starting with '# Question'. Finally, the function returns the question and answer sections in tuple format after stripping leading/trailing spaces.","status":200,"tokens":[0,285],"elapsed":2.238491928,"_type":"aimessage"}]
