[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how we can solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    q_flag, a_flag = false, false\n    lines = split(md,\"\\n\")\n    for line in lines\n        if line == \"# Question\" && !q_flag && !a_flag\n            q_flag = true\n        elseif line == \"# Answer\" && q_flag && !a_flag\n            a_flag = true\n        elseif q_flag && a_flag \n            break\n        elseif q_flag\n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif a_flag\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nThis function loops through each line of the markdown. If it encounters `# Question` and `q_flag` is false, it sets `q_flag` to true and continues reading lines until a new section or the end of the file starts. It does the same for `# Answer`. When it encounters an answer, it breaks and moves on to read next question. If there are no `# Question` nor `# Answer`, it just keeps going through each line until reaching either one of them.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that your markdown follows your problem description exactly with the same section headers. If your markdown is different, you need to adjust this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,330],"elapsed":2.720780844,"_type":"aimessage"}]
