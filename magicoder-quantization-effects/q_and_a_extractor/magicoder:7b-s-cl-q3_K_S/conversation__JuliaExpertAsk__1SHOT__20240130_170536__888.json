Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can solve it using Python:\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = None\n    answer = None\n    \n    lines = md.split('\\n')\n    for line in lines:\n        if line.startswith('# Question'):\n            question = re.sub('^#*\\s*', '', line).strip()\n        elif line.startswith('# Answer'):\n            answer = re.sub('^#*\\s*', '', line).strip()\n    \n    return (question,answer) if all([question,answer]) else None\n```\n\nThis function `q_and_a_extractor` splits the input markdown text into lines and iterates through each line. If a line starts with `# Question`, it sets `question` to be the line without leading '#' symbols and spaces; if a line starts with `# Answer`, it sets `answer` to be the line without leading '#' symbols and spaces. At the end, it checks whether both `question` and `answer` are not None, if so return them in a tuple as answer.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes there will always be an Answer after Question and that they appear in order. If this is not guaranteed, you may want to consider returning all questions or answers found or handling the absence of either separately.","status":200,"tokens":[0,296],"elapsed":2.382515434,"_type":"aimessage"}]
