Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

If a line starts with \"# Question\", it switches to processing question lines; if it starts with \"# Answer\", it switches to processing answer lines. Any non-empty lines in these sections are added to the question or answer strings after stripping any leading spaces or newlines. The function finally returns a tuple of the extracted question and answer strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,280],"elapsed":2.092041766,"_type":"aimessage"}]
