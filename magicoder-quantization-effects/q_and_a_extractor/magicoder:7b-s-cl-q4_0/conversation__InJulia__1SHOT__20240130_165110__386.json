[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question *= strip(line[13:end])\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer *= strip(line[12:end])\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the markdown string into lines and iterating over each line. If it encounters a line starting with \"# Question\", it appends the text after this marker to the question variable. Similarly, if it encounters a line starting with \"# Answer\", it appends the text following this marker to the answer variable. The `strip` function is used to remove any leading spaces or newlines from the extracted text.\n\nUsage:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is your name?\n\n# Answer\nMy name is Julia.\n\"\"\"\n@show q_and_a_extractor(md) # should return (\"What is your name?\", \"My name is Julia.\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,287],"elapsed":2.157982603,"_type":"aimessage"}]
