Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution using regular expressions:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = re.search(r'# Question\\n(.*?)(?=\\n# Answer|$)', md, re.DOTALL)\n    answer = re.search(r'# Answer\\n(.*?)(?=\\n# Question|$)', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    if question and answer:\n        return (question.group(1).strip(), answer.group(1).strip())\n    else:\n        return None\n```\n\nThis function works by first using the `re` module to search for the sections \"Question\" and \"Answer\". The `.*?` part is a non-greedy matcher, meaning it will stop matching at the earliest opportunity. This allows us to capture both the question and answer in the same match. \n\nThe `(?=\\n# Question|$)`, `(?=\\n# Answer|$)` parts are lookaheads which assert that we're either looking for a new \"Question\" or end of text, or a new \"Answer\" or end of text. This ensures that the next section starts on a new line. \n\nIf both sections exist in `md`, it returns them as a tuple after stripping leading spaces and newlines. If one or both sections are missing, it returns None.","status":200,"tokens":[0,309],"elapsed":2.323730046,"_type":"aimessage"}]
