[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can do this:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_question && !isempty(line)\n            question *= line[end]\n        elseif in_answer && !isempty(line)\n            answer *= line[end]\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function reads the markdown text line by line, and if it encounters a line starting with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it sets the corresponding flag to true. If it encounters any other line while reading the question or answer, it appends the stripped version of that line (with leading spaces removed) to the current question/answer text. The function then returns the extracted question and answer as a tuple.\n\nPlease note that this is a simple implementation and might not work for all types of markdown structures. For more complex tasks or if you want a robust solution, consider using a dedicated Markdown parsing library such as Documenter.jl's `makedoc` function or the `Markdown` package from Pkg.","status":200,"tokens":[0,348],"elapsed":2.605369775,"_type":"aimessage"}]
