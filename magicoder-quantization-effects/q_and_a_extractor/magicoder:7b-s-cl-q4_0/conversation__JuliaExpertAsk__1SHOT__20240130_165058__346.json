Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

If a line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it sets the corresponding flag to `true`. It then checks if this flag is set and if the current line is not empty, it appends the stripped content of the line to the question/answer string. This way, all text after `# Question` (or `# Answer`) until the next section header is added to the respective variable.\n\nNote that the function also considers lines starting with \"#\" in general, not only at the beginning of a markdown block. If you want to strictly enforce blocks start with \"#\", you would need to add additional checks.","status":200,"tokens":[0,342],"elapsed":2.626813889,"_type":"aimessage"}]
