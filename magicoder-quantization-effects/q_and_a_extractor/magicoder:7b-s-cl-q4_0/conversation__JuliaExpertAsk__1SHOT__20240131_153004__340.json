Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

If it encounters a line that starts with `# Question`, it switches on to collecting the question, and if it encounters a line that starts with `# Answer`, it switches onto collecting the answer. It then continues until it finds another section header (indicating the end of the current section). The extracted text is concatenated onto `question` or `answer` variables, stripping leading spaces and newlines as it goes. Finally, the function returns a tuple with the cleaned-up question and answer.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that each `# Question` block has exactly one corresponding `# Answer`. If there can be multiple answers (or no answer), or if the sections aren't properly separated by headers, you may need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,407],"elapsed":3.070399743,"_type":"aimessage"}]
