[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can write this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    \n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\") \n            in_question = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_question && !isempty(line)\n            question *= line[end]\n        end\n\n        if in_answer && !isempty(line) \n            answer *= line[end]\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nThis function will read the markdown line by line, and whenever it encounters a line that starts with `\"# Question\"` or `\"# Answer\"`, it sets its corresponding boolean to true. Then, if the line contains text and belongs to either the question or the answer section (according to whether the boolean is set), it appends the stripped text (`line[end]`) to the appropriate string. At the end of the function, it returns a tuple with the extracted question and answer.\n\nPlease note that this function only removes leading spaces and newlines from each line in the input string, not from the whole markdown file or document. If you are working with the whole file or document, other preprocessing steps may be necessary depending on the specific formatting of your markdown file.","status":200,"tokens":[0,365],"elapsed":2.84823871,"_type":"aimessage"}]
