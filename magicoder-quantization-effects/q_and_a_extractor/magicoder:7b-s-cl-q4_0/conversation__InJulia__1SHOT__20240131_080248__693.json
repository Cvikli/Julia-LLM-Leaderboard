Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

If a line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it sets the corresponding flag to true, and continues to the next iteration. If a line is not empty and the question or answer flags are set, it appends the line to the appropriate variable (question or answer), stripping any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text. Finally, it returns the tuple of the question and answer after all lines have been processed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,325],"elapsed":2.446203657,"_type":"aimessage"}]
