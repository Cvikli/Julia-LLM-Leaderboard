It then strips any leading spaces or newlines from both question and answer texts. The result is returned as a tuple `(question, answer)`. If there are no \"Question\" or \"Answer\" sections in the markdown string, it throws an error.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is your name?\n\n# Answer\nI am a language model developed by OpenAI.\n\"\"\"\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md)) # prints (\"What is your name?\", \"I am a language model developed by OpenAI.\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,385],"elapsed":2.917672602,"_type":"aimessage"}]
