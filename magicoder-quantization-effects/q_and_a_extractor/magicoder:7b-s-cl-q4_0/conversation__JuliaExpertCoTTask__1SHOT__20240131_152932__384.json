Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

If it's a line that starts with `# Question`, it sets `section` to \"question\". Similarly, if it's a line starting with `# Answer`, it sets `section` to \"answer\". For any other line, depending on which section it's in (either question or answer), it appends the stripped version of that line to either `question` or `answer`. After going through all lines, it returns a tuple of the cleaned-up versions of `question` and `answer`.","status":200,"tokens":[272,315],"elapsed":6.621214373,"_type":"aimessage"}]
