[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you could solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    section = \"\"\n    \n    for line in split(md, '\\n')\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            section = \"question\"\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            section = \"answer\"\n        elseif section == \"question\" && isempty(question) \n            question *= strip(line[15:end])\n        elseif section == \"answer\" && isempty(answer)\n            answer *= strip(line[13:end])\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function goes through each line of the markdown text and identifies lines that start with `# Question` or `# Answer`. When it identifies these lines, it switches the current section to either \"question\" or \"answer\". After this, if it's currently in the \"question\" section and no text has been added yet, it adds the stripped line content to `question`, and vice versa for the answer. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that each section is separated by a blank line from the next. If there are multiple sections of question/answer within a single paragraph or if they aren't separated by blank lines, then you would need a more sophisticated method to identify them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,329],"elapsed":2.553544721,"_type":"aimessage"}]
