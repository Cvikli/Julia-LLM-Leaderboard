[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function `q_and_a_extractor` written in Julia that extracts the question and answer from the markdown formatted text:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    mode = 0 # 0 for outside, 1 for Question, 2 for Answer\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            mode = 1\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            mode = 2\n        elseif mode == 1 && !isempty(strip(line))\n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif mode == 2 && !isempty(strip(line))\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the markdown text into lines and iterating over each line. If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\", it switches to mode 1, indicating that the following lines are part of the question. Similarly for mode 2 (Answer). For every other line, if we're in mode 1 or 2, it appends the stripped version of the line to the current section.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is only one question and one answer per markdown text. If there are multiple sections for either questions or answers, you may need a more sophisticated approach.","status":200,"tokens":[398,347],"elapsed":2.826073638,"_type":"aimessage"}]
