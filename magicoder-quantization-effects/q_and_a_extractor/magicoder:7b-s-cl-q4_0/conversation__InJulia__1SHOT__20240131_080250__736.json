[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem using Julia's regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = match(r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n## Answer\", md, re.I).captures[1]\n    answer = match(r\"## Answer\\n(.*?)\\n$\", md, re.I).captures[1]\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses two regular expressions to extract the text between `# Question` and `# Answer`. The `match` function returns a match object which has a `captures` field that contains an array of matching strings. We then use `strip` to remove any leading spaces or newlines from the extracted text.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that there is only one question and answer in the markdown text, and that they are separated by exactly two `#` characters (i.e., no extra spaces before or after). If your markdown can have multiple questions/answers or additional sections, you will need to adjust the regular expressions accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,249],"elapsed":1.890359892,"_type":"aimessage"}]
