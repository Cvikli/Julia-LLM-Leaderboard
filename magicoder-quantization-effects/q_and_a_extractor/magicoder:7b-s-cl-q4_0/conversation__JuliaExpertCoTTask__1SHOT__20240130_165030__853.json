Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem using Python's `re` module, which provides regular expression matching operations similar to those found in Perl. Here is a simple function that should do what you need:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    match = re.findall('(?<=# Question\\n).*?(?=\\n# Answer)', md, re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE)  # extracts the sections\n    \n    if len(match) == 2:  # check that we have a question and an answer\n        return (re.sub('^[\\s]*\\n', '', match[0].strip()), re.sub('^[\\s]*\\n', '', match[1].strip()))  \n    else:\n        return (\"No Question or Answer found\", \"No Question or Answer found\")  # or you could raise an exception\n```\nYou can call the function with your given data like so:\n\n```python\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n\\n# Answer\\nThe capital of France is Paris.\\n\"))\n```\n\nThis will return a tuple of strings, where each string is stripped of leading spaces and newlines. If there's no question or answer found in `md`, it returns \"No Question or Answer found\" for both.","status":200,"tokens":[0,309],"elapsed":2.38221112,"_type":"aimessage"}]
