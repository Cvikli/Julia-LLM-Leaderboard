The `re.DOTALL` flag is used to make the dot (`.`) in the regular expression match any character, including a newline. \n\nThe extracted text is then stripped of leading spaces and newlines using the `strip` method, and the resulting strings are returned as a tuple. If either section does not exist in the markdown text, an empty string is returned for that section.","status":200,"tokens":[0,279],"elapsed":2.168952168,"_type":"aimessage"}]
