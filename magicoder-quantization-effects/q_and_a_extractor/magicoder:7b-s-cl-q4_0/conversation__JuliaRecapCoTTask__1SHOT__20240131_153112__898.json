X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can approach this problem using Julia:\n\nFirstly, let's define a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract questions and answers from the markdown formatted text. This function will use regular expressions (regex) to identify these sections in the markdown text.\n\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    pattern = r\"# Question(.*?)(?=^# Answer|^$)\"s\n    question = replace(match(pattern, md).captures[1], \"\\n\" => \"\", prefix = \"\")\n    \n    pattern = r\"# Answer(.*?)(?=\\n\\n|\\Z)\"s\n    answer = replace(match(pattern, md).captures[1], \"\\n\" => \"\", prefix = \"\")\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by defining two patterns: one for the question and another for the answer. The `?` after `.*?` makes the match lazy, i.e., it will stop as soon as possible to avoid matching too much. The `(?=^# Answer|^$)` is a positive lookahead that ensures we are at the start of an answer section or end of the text. Similarly, for the answer pattern.\n\nFinally, you can call this function with your markdown string:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question 1\nThis is the first question.\n\n# Answer 1\nThis is the first answer.\n\n# Question 2\nThis is the second question.\n\n# Answer 2\nThis is the second answer.\n\"\"\"\nq_and_a_extractor(md)\n```\n\nThis will return a tuple of strings with leading spaces and newlines removed:\n\n```julia\n(\"This is the first question.\", \"This is the first answer.\")\n(\"This is the second question.\", \"This is the second answer.\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[11,440],"elapsed":3.421473313,"_type":"aimessage"}]
