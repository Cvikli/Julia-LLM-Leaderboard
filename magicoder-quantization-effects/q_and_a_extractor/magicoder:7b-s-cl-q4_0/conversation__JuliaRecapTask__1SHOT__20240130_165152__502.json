[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function `q_and_a_extractor` written in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    currentSection = \"\"\n    \n    for line in eachline(md, keep=true)\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            currentSection = \"question\"\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            currentSection = \"answer\"\n        elseif (startswith(line, \" \") || startswith(line, \"\\t\")) && length(currentSection) > 0\n            if currentSection == \"question\"\n                question *= replace(lstrip(line),\"\\n\",\"\")\n            elseif currentSection == \"answer\"\n                answer *= replace(lstrip(line),\"\\n\",\"\")\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThe function `eachline` reads the string line by line. The variable `currentSection` keeps track of which section we are currently in. We strip leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text using `replace(lstrip(line),\"\\n\",\"\")`. The extracted text is then appended to either the question or answer variable. \n\nThe function returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer. Note that this is a simple solution and might not work perfectly for all markdown files as it assumes that each section begins with `# Question`/`# Answer`, and it does not handle nested sections correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,343],"elapsed":2.670856478,"_type":"aimessage"}]
