[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem, we'll write a function that uses regular expressions to match the question and answer sections in the markdown. The regular expression will be defined as `# Question(.*?)(# Answer|$)`. This matches text between the hashtag \"Question\" up to but not including \"Answer\" or end of file.\n\nHere is the Julia code:\n```julia\nusing Base.Regex\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Find match for question and answer in markdown text\n    m = match(r\"# Question(.*?)(# Answer|$)\", md, 1)\n    \n    if isnothing(m)\n        return (nothing, nothing)\n    end\n    \n    # Remove leading spaces and newlines from matched strings\n    question = replace(m.captures[1], r\"^\\n*\" => \"\") |> strip\n    answer = match(r\"# Answer(.*?)$\", md, 1) |> capture2end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nIn this function:\n- The `match` function matches the regular expression pattern in the markdown text.\n- If a match is found, it extracts the question and answer sections into the variables \"question\" and \"answer\".\n- The `captures[1]` refers to the first matching group (everything after \"# Question\") in the regex.\n- The `|>` operator is used for pipeline function composition which passes the value on as input to the next function. This is a shorthand way of writing a series of chained functions without needing to use intermediate variables. It is equivalent to `x |> f |> g` being the same as `g(f(x))`.\n- The `strip` function removes leading and trailing whitespaces from strings.\n- If no match is found, it returns `(nothing, nothing)`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,415],"elapsed":3.251795005,"_type":"aimessage"}]
