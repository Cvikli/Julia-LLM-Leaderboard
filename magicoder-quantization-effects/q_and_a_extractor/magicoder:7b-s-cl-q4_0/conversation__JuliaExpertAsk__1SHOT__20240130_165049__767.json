Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of this function using Python's `re` module for regex operations. This will work under the assumption that each section `# Question` or `# Answer` starts on a separate line:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    lines = md.split('\\n')\n    question = ''\n    answer = ''\n    in_question = False\n    in_answer = False\n    \n    for line in lines:\n        if line == '# Question':\n            in_question = True\n            continue\n        elif line == '# Answer':\n            in_answer = True\n            continue\n        \n        if in_question and re.match('\\s*', line): # Strip leading spaces\n            question += ' ' + re.sub(r'\\s+', ' ', line)\n        elif in_answer and re.match('\\s*', line): # Strip leading spaces\n            answer += ' ' + re.sub(r'\\s+', ' ', line)\n            \n    return (question, answer)\n```\nThis function works by splitting the markdown text into lines and then iterating over those lines. When it encounters `# Question` or `# Answer`, it toggles a flag for that section (in_question and in_answer). If the line contains leading spaces (indicating it's part of the current question/answer), the function strips those leading spaces from the line and appends it to the corresponding variable. It repeats this until it has processed all lines, then returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer.\n\nNote: This assumes that each section `# Question` or `# Answer` is on its own line. If this isn't always true in your markdown, you may need a more sophisticated solution to identify these sections.","status":200,"tokens":[0,399],"elapsed":3.072803585,"_type":"aimessage"}]
