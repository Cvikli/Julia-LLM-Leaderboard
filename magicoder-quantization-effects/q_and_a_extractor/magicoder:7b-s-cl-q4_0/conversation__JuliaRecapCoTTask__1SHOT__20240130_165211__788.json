[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible solution written in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question *= lstrip(replace(line[12:end],\"#\",\"\"))*\"\\n\"\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer *= lstrip(replace(line[10:end],\"#\",\"\"))*\"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function splits the input markdown string into lines using \"\\n\", then processes each line. If a line starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`, it appends the rest of the line to the `question` or `answer` variable respectively after removing the `#` and leading spaces/newlines. The result is returned as a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\nThe function `lstrip(s::AbstractString)` removes any leading space characters from string `s`. The function `replace(s::AbstractString, old::AbstractString, new::AbstractString)` replaces all occurrences of `old` with `new` in the string `s`.\n\nPlease make sure to replace `\"{{instructions}}\"` with your special instructions.","status":200,"tokens":[0,306],"elapsed":2.416896783,"_type":"aimessage"}]
