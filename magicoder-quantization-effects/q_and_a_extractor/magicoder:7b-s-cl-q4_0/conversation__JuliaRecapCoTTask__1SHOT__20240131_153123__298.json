[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function that will extract the Question and Answer sections from a markdown-formatted text:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(strip(md), \"\\n\")\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    inQuestion, inAnswer = false, false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestion = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inAnswer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if inQuestion && !startswith(line, \"### \")\n            question *= line[6:end] # strip leading spaces and hashes\n        elseif inAnswer && !startswith(line, \"### \")\n            answer *= line[5:end] # strip leading spaces and hashes\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function splits the markdown text into lines using the newline character as a separator. It then iterates through each line, checking if it's part of the Question or Answer section by looking for the specific start strings (\"# Question\" and \"# Answer\"). If found, it sets the corresponding boolean to true (indicating that the next lines are part of this section). The text from these sections is stored in a variable until the next section is encountered. At the end, the function returns the extracted question and answer as a tuple.\n\nThe function also handles stripping leading spaces and hashes for each line, which is necessary since markdown allows for different levels of headers (indicated by hashtags).\n\nPlease note that this function assumes the Question and Answer sections are well-formatted, i.e., they start with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", followed only by a single level of subsections. If there could be multiple levels of subsections, more complex logic would be needed to handle them appropriately.","status":200,"tokens":[0,437],"elapsed":3.398419262,"_type":"aimessage"}]
