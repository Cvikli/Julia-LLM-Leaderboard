Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Python solution for your problem:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = re.findall(r'\\n# Question(.+?)\\n', md, re.DOTALL)\n    answer = re.findall(r'\\n# Answer(.+?)\\n', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    return (question[0].strip(), answer[0].strip()) if question and answer else (\"\",\"\")\n\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n\\n# Answer\\nThe capital of France is Paris.\\n\"))\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all text between `# Question` and `# Answer`.

If there are multiple pairs in the same string, you would need a different approach to handle them all.","status":200,"tokens":[272,244],"elapsed":14.135671575,"_type":"aimessage"}]
