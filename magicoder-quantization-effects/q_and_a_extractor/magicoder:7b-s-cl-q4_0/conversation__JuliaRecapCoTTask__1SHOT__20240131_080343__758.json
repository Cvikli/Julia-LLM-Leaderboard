[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible solution using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_question && !isempty(line)\n            question *= line[end]\n        elseif in_answer && !isempty(line)\n            answer *= line[end]\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function splits the input string `md` into lines and iterates over each line. If a line starts with `# Question`, it sets `in_question = true`. Similarly, if a line starts with `# Answer`, it sets `in_answer = true`. If the current line is part of a question or answer (i.e., `in_question` or `in_answer` are true), it appends the content of the line to the corresponding variable (`question` or `answer`). It then returns a tuple with stripped versions of the extracted question and answer.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that there is only one `# Question` and one `# Answer` in the markdown text, and that they are not nested within other sections. If these assumptions do not hold, the function may need to be modified accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,359],"elapsed":2.774685425,"_type":"aimessage"}]
