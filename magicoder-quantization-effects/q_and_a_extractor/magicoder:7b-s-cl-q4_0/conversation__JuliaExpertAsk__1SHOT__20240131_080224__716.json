It returns a tuple of two strings: the first string is the question, the second one is the answer. If there are no questions or answers in the input markdown, it returns `None`.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```python\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is your name?\n\n# Answer\nMy name is John Doe.\n\"\"\"\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(md))  # Output: ('What is your name?', 'My name is John Doe.')\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,334],"elapsed":2.520355901,"_type":"aimessage"}]
