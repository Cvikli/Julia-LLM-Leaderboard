[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple solution using Julia's built-in string manipulation functions:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Split the markdown into sections\n    sections = split(md, \"# \")[2:end]\n    \n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    for section in sections\n        if startswith(section, \"Question\")\n            question = strip(split(section, \"\\n\")[2]) # strip leading spaces and newlines\n        elseif startswith(section, \"Answer\")\n            answer = strip(split(section, \"\\n\")[2]) # strip leading spaces and newlines\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the markdown string into sections based on `#` as a delimiter. Then it iterates over each section, checks if it's a question or an answer, and extracts the relevant text after stripping leading spaces and newlines. If there are multiple questions/answers in the input string, this function will only return the last one.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that every `# Question` or `# Answer` section is followed by a line of text without any leading spaces. If the markdown format can vary significantly from this simple pattern, you might need to adjust the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,300],"elapsed":2.318073301,"_type":"aimessage"}]
