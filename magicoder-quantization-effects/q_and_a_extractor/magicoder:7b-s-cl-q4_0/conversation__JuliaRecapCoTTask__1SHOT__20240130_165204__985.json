[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of the function `q_and_a_extractor` in Julia language:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(strip(md), '\\n')\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    section = nothing\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            section = :question\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            section = :answer\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if section == :question \n            question *= strip(replace(line, r\"^#+ \" => \"\"))\n        elseif section == :answer \n            answer *= strip(replace(line, r\"^#+ \" => \"\"))\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the markdown text into lines and scanning each line. If a line starts with \"# Question\", it is marked as question section, and if a line starts with \"# Answer\", it is marked as answer section. During the same session, any non-empty lines in the question section are appended to `question` variable, and any non-empty lines in the answer section are appended to `answer` variable. Both strings are returned after removing leading spaces and newline characters from each string.\n\nThe function `strip(replace(line, r\"^#+ \" => \"\"))` is used to remove leading '#' symbols and spaces from the text extracted. The regular expression 'r\"^#+ \"' matches any lines that start with one or more '#' symbols followed by one or more spaces. \n\nThe `startswith` function checks if a line starts with the given string, and `continue` statement skips further execution of loop body for this iteration.","status":200,"tokens":[0,408],"elapsed":3.174660664,"_type":"aimessage"}]
