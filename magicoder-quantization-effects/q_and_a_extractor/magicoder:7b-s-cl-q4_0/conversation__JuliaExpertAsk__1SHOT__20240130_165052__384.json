The `findall()` method returns a list of tuples where each tuple contains the match and any groups it has. In this case, we only have one group (the entire section), so the result is a list of strings. \n\nWe loop over these sections to find the question and answer and store them in the `question` and `answer` variables respectively. We strip leading spaces and newlines from the text before returning it as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,292],"elapsed":2.269816665,"_type":"aimessage"}]
