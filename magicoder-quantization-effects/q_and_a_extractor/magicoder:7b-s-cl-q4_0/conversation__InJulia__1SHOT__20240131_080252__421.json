[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple solution using Julia's regular expression module:\n\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = match(r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n(?=# Answer)\", md, 1).match\n    answer = match(r\"# Answer\\n(.*?)\\n\", md, 1).match\n    \n    if !isnothing(question) && !isnothing(answer)\n        return (strip(question), strip(answer))\n    else\n        error(\"Markdown does not contain both a 'Question' and an 'Answer' section.\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses two regular expressions to match the text between `# Question` and `# Answer`. The `match` function returns the first match, which is the entire matched string (including leading spaces and newlines). The `?` after `.*` makes it a non-greedy match, so it stops at the nearest `# Answer`, not at the last one.\n\nIf there's no question or answer in the markdown, the function raises an error.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the markdown is formatted correctly and exactly as described. If the markdown can have other sections or formats, you may need a more complex regular expression or parsing method.","status":200,"tokens":[0,291],"elapsed":2.20332996,"_type":"aimessage"}]
