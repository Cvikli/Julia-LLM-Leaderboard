[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of `q_and_a_extractor` function using Julia programming language:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question *= lstrip(split(line, \"Question\")[2])\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer *= lstrip(split(line, \"Answer\")[2])\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the markdown text into lines and then iterating over each line. If a line starts with \"# Question\", it appends the rest of the line to `question` after stripping any leading spaces or newlines. Similarly, if a line starts with \"# Answer\", it appends the rest of the line to `answer`.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is only one question and answer in the markdown text. If there are multiple sections, you may want to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,262],"elapsed":1.983709426,"_type":"aimessage"}]
