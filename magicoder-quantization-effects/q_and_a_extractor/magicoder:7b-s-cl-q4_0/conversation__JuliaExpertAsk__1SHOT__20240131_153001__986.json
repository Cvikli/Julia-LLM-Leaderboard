Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution using regular expressions:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    # Extract question and answer sections\n    match = re.findall(r'# Question(.*?)# Answer', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    if not match:  # If no match found, return None for both\n        return (None, None)\n    \n    # Remove leading spaces and newlines from each section\n    question = match[0].strip()\n    answer = match[1].strip()\n    \n    return (question,answer)\n```\n\nThis function uses the `re.findall` method to find all matching sections in the markdown text. The regular expression `r'# Question(.*?)# Answer'` looks for sections starting with `# Question` and ending with `# Answer`. The `(.*?)` part is a non-greedy match, meaning it will stop at the first `# Answer`, not the last one. The `re.DOTALL` flag allows `.` to match any character including newline.\n\nIf no matches are found, the function returns both elements of the tuple as None. If there is at least one match, it strips leading spaces and newlines from each section using the `strip` method.","status":200,"tokens":[0,283],"elapsed":2.126101259,"_type":"aimessage"}]
