If there is no question or answer, an empty string is returned for that part of the tuple.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that each section (question and answer) starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`. If there can be other lines starting with `#` before these keywords, you would need to adjust the regular expressions accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,248],"elapsed":1.87629651,"_type":"aimessage"}]
