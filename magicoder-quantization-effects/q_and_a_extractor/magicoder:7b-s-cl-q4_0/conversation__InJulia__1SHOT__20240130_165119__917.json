[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can achieve this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    q_flag = false\n    a_flag = false\n    \n    for line in lines \n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\") \n            q_flag = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            a_flag = true\n        elseif q_flag && !startswith(line, \"### \")\n            question *= replace(strip(line), ' ', '')\n        elseif a_flag && !startswith(line, \"### \")\n            answer *= replace(strip(line), ' ', '')\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function splits the input `md` string into an array of lines. It then goes through each line checking for the start of a question or answer section. When it finds them, it sets the corresponding flag to true. If the current line doesn't begin with \"### \", indicating it is not a sub-section, it strips leading spaces and appends the resulting string to either `question` or `answer`, depending on which flag was set at the start of that section. The function then returns both question and answer in a tuple.\n  \nThe `replace(s, old, new)` function from Base will replace all occurrences of `old` with `new` in string `s`. In this case, we are replacing all spaces (' ') with nothing (''). This effectively removes any leading spaces in the extracted text. The `strip(line)` function from Base also strips the leading and trailing whitespaces from each line.","status":200,"tokens":[0,398],"elapsed":3.044640222,"_type":"aimessage"}]
