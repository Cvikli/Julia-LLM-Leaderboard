Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of `q_and_a_extractor` function using python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    lines = md.split('\\n')\n    \n    question = ''\n    answer = ''\n    inQuestionSection = False\n    \n    for line in lines:\n        if '# Answer' in line:\n            inQuestionSection = False\n            \n        if inQuestionSection and not answer == '':\n            answer += '\\n' + line.lstrip()\n        \n        elif '# Question' in line:\n            inQuestionSection = True\n            question += '\\n' + line.lstrip()\n    \n    return (re.sub('\\s+', ' ', question).strip(), \n            re.sub('\\s+', ' ', answer).strip())\n```\nThe function works by splitting the markdown text into lines and iterating through each line. If it sees a line that indicates the start of an Answer section, it stops collecting Question text and starts collecting Answer text. When it finds a line indicating the end of a Question section, it stops collecting Answer text and starts collecting Question text. The extracted texts are joined together with spaces and any leading or trailing whitespace is removed before returning the result as a tuple.\n\nThis function assumes that there won't be multiple consecutive sections starting with '# Question' and '# Answer'. If there can be such cases, you may want to modify it accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,324],"elapsed":2.48232626,"_type":"aimessage"}]
