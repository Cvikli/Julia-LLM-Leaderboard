If a line starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`, it sets a flag for that section and continues to the next line. If it's in the Question section and finds a non-empty line, it adds this line (after stripping any leading spaces) to the question string. Same goes for the answer section.\n\nYou can call this function with your markdown text like so: `q_and_a_extractor(md)`.","status":200,"tokens":[128,352],"elapsed":2.673325809,"_type":"aimessage"}]
