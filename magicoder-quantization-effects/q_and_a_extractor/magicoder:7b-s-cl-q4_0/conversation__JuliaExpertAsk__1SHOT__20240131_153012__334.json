The first list contains the questions, and the second list contains the answers. If no question or answer is found in the provided markdown text, an empty list will be returned for that section.\n\nThe regular expressions used here are based on the assumption that the sections start with `# Question` or `# Answer`, followed by a newline character `\\n`, then any amount of characters (`.*?`) until a new line character `\\n` is encountered again. The `re.DOTALL` flag is used to make `.` match all characters including newlines. \n\nAfter the text is extracted, leading spaces and newlines are removed from each string in both lists using list comprehensions with the `re.sub` function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,366],"elapsed":2.760160848,"_type":"aimessage"}]
