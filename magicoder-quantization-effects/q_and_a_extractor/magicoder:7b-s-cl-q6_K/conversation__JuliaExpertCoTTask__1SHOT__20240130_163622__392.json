If it is, we set our state variable accordingly and continue to the next line. If it's neither of these, we add its content (after stripping leading/trailing spaces) to either the question or answer string, depending on our current state. At the end, we return a tuple containing the question and answer strings, after further stripping any remaining leading/trailing whitespace from each.\n\nYou can test this function with your provided data:\n```julia\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\"))\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,433],"elapsed":4.306942596,"_type":"aimessage"}]
