[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")  # Split the markdown into lines\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestionBlock = false\n    inAnswerBlock = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestionBlock = true\n            continue\n        end\n        if startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inAnswerBlock = true\n            continue\n        end\n        if inQuestionBlock && !startswith(line, \" \")\n            question *= line[2:end]  # Append the text without the leading space\n        elseif inAnswerBlock && !startswith(line, \" \")\n            answer *= line[2:end]\n        end\n    end\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each line of the markdown. If it encounters a line starting with \"# Question\", it starts recording the question text. Similarly, if it encounters a line starting with \"# Answer\", it starts recording the answer text. It appends the text to the respective variable after removing the leading space and newlines. Finally, it returns the extracted question and answer as a tuple after stripping any extra spaces at the beginning or end of either string.\n\nThis function assumes that there is only one question and answer section in the markdown and that each section ends with another section header (# Question or # Answer). If there are multiple sections, you would need to modify this code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,367],"elapsed":3.523335888,"_type":"aimessage"}]
