[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you might solve this task in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the markdown string into an array of lines\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    \n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    inQuestionSection = false\n    inAnswerSection = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestionSection = true\n            continue\n        elseif inQuestionSection && !startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            # Remove leading spaces and append to question string\n            push!(question, replace(line, r\"^ +\" => \"\"))\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inAnswerSection = true\n            continue\n        elseif inAnswerSection && !startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            # Remove leading spaces and append to answer string\n            push!(answer, replace(line, r\"^ +\" => \"\"))\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return question, answer\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each line in the markdown. When it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\", it starts recording lines for the question section. Similarly, when it encounters a line that starts with \"# Answer\", it starts recording lines for the answer section. The `push!` function is used to append the trimmed content of each line to the appropriate variable (question or answer). Finally, it returns the question and answer as a tuple.\n\nPlease make sure to replace {{instructions}} in Special Instructions with your instructions if any.","status":200,"tokens":[0,368],"elapsed":3.650096587,"_type":"aimessage"}]
