The `re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE` flags are used to make `.` match any character (including newlines) and `^` and `$` match the start and end of a line, respectively.\n\nThen, it strips leading spaces and newlines from each extracted text using list comprehension and regular expression substitution. The `\\A\\s*|\\n\\s*` pattern matches the start of a string or a newline followed by zero or more spaces.\n\nThe function finally returns the question and answer as a tuple. If there is no `# Question` or `# Answer`, it will return an empty list for that part.","status":200,"tokens":[0,364],"elapsed":3.481164091,"_type":"aimessage"}]
