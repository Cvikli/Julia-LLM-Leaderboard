If it's a question or an answer, it appends the stripped version of that line to either the question or the answer variable. The variables are then returned as a tuple at the end.\n\nNote: This function assumes that there will only be one question and one answer in the markdown string. If there are multiple questions/answers, or if they are not separated by `# Question` and `# Answer`, additional logic would need to be added to handle those cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,323],"elapsed":3.129947233,"_type":"aimessage"}]
