[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function written in Julia that should do this:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestionSection = false\n    inAnswerSection = false\n    \n    for line in lines \n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\") \n            inQuestionSection = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if inQuestionSection && !startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            question *= line[end] == \" \" ? line[2:end-1] : line[2:end]\n        end\n        \n        if startswith(line, \"# Answer\") \n            inAnswerSection = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if inAnswerSection && !startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            answer *= line[end] == \" \" ? line[2:end-1] : line[2:end]\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function splits the markdown into lines, then iterates over each line. If it encounters a line that starts with `# Question`, it sets `inQuestionSection` to true and continues to the next line. Similarly, if it encounters a line that starts with `# Answer`, it sets `inAnswerSection` to true and continues to the next line. It then checks each line to see whether it should be appended to the question or answer text based on the current section status (i.e., whether it's in the question or answer sections). The function finally returns a tuple containing the cleaned up question and answer texts. \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that `# Question` and `# Answer` are unique per-section delimiters, i.e., there cannot be another section of text with these same tags within the same markdown file. If your input data can contain multiple sections of text with these headers, you will need to adjust this code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[98,456],"elapsed":4.471903062,"_type":"aimessage"}]
