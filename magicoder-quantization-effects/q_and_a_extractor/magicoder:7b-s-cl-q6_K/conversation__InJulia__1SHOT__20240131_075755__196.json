If a line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it sets the corresponding boolean flag to true and continues to the next line. If these flags are true and a line does not start with a space, it appends the content of the line to the question or answer string respectively. Finally, it returns a tuple of stripped strings (question,answer).","status":200,"tokens":[0,279],"elapsed":2.655136866,"_type":"aimessage"}]
