The `re.DOTALL` flag is used to make `.` match any character, including newlines. \n\nAfter finding the matches, we use a list comprehension with `sub` function from `re` module to remove leading spaces and newlines from each extracted text.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there will be at most one question and answer per markdown section. If there are multiple questions or answers in the same section, only the last one will be returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,327],"elapsed":3.124423401,"_type":"aimessage"}]
