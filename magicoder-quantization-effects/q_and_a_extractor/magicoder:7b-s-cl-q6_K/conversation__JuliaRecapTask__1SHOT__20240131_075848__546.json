[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n        end\n        \n        if in_question && !isempty(line)\n            question *= line[2:end] * \"\\n\"\n        elseif in_answer && !isempty(line)\n            answer *= line[2:end] * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function splits the input markdown text into lines, then iterates over each line. If a line starts with \"# Question\", it sets `in_question` to true and appends the rest of the line to the question string. If a line starts with \"# Answer\", it sets `in_answer` to true and appends the rest of the line to the answer string. Any leading spaces are removed from each line before appending it to the respective string.\n\nThe function returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer, stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.","status":200,"tokens":[0,328],"elapsed":3.213415396,"_type":"aimessage"}]
