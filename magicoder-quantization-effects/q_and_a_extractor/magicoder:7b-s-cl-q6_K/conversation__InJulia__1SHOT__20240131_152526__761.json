[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    section = \"\"\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\") || startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            section = line[1:7]\n        elseif section == \"# Question\" && !isempty(line)\n            question *= line[end-length(line)+2:end]\n        elseif section == \"# Answer\" && !isempty(line)\n            answer *= line[end-length(line)+2:end]\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating through each line of the markdown string. If a line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it sets `section` to that value and continues reading lines until an empty line is encountered. For all other lines, if they are not blank, and we're currently in the \"Question\" section, it appends the text after the '# ' to `question`, and for the \"Answer\" section it does the same with `answer`. The `strip` function is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,309],"elapsed":2.958585051,"_type":"aimessage"}]
