Then it iterates over each line in that array. If a line starts with \"# Question\", it sets a flag `start_question` to true and continues on to the next line. The same goes for `# Answer`. If those flags are set, and this is not a line starting with \" \", then it adds the stripped line (minus any leading spaces) into either `question` or `answer`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,285],"elapsed":2.748330196,"_type":"aimessage"}]
