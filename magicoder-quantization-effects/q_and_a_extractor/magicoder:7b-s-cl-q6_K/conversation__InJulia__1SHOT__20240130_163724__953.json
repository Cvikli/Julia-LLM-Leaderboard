Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

Here is how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    current_section = \"\"\n    \n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            current_section = \"question\"\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            current_section = \"answer\"\n        elseif current_section == \"question\" && !isempty(strip(line))\n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif current_section == \"answer\" && !isempty(strip(line))\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function goes through each line in the markdown string, checking if it's a section header. If so, it starts recording the text for that section. It also checks if the current line is not empty after stripping leading and trailing spaces and newlines, because these lines belong to the previous section if they are not empty.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is your name?\n\n# Answer\nMy name is Julia.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion_answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: \", question_answer[1])  # Outputs: \"Question: What is your name?\"\nprintln(\"Answer: \", question_answer[2])    # Outputs: \"Answer: My name is Julia.\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,384],"elapsed":3.721405872,"_type":"aimessage"}]
