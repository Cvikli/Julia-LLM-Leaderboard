[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can do this using regular expressions in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = matchall(r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n## Answer\", md, 1)\n    answer = matchall(r\"## Answer\\n(.*?)\\n\", md, 1)\n    \n    # Remove leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text\n    question = map(strip, question)\n    answer = map(strip, answer)\n\n    return (question[1], answer[1])\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `matchall` function to find all occurrences of the specified patterns in the markdown text. The `map` function is used to apply the `strip` function to each element of the resulting arrays, which removes leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text. \n\nNote that this assumes that there will be exactly one question and answer section in the input markdown text. If there might be multiple sections, you would need a more sophisticated approach to handle them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,241],"elapsed":2.284178697,"_type":"aimessage"}]
