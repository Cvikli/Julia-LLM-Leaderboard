Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem using Julia's regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = match(r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n\", md, re\"s\") |> m -> strip(m.match)\n    answer = match(r\"# Answer\\n(.*)\", md, re\"s\")  |> m -> strip(m.match)\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by using the `strip` function to remove any leading spaces and newlines from the matched strings. It then returns a tuple containing the question and the answer. If no match is found for either of these sections, the corresponding field in the returned tuple will be an empty string. Note that `.*?` is used in the regular expression to make the `.*` non-greedy (i.e., it stops matching as soon as possible), which allows us to capture all text from the `# Question` or `# Answer` line until the next line starting with a `#`.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\n  This is my question?\n# Answer\n  This is my answer!\n\"\"\"\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md)) # outputs (\"This is my question?\", \"This is my answer!\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,315],"elapsed":3.053788315,"_type":"aimessage"}]
