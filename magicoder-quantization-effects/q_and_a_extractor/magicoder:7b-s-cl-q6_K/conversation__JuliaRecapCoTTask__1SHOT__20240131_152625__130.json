[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use the `eachmatch` function to find all occurrences of `# Question` and `# Answer` in your markdown string, then extract the text between these markers:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = String[]\n    answers = String[]\n    \n    for match in eachmatch(r\"# Question(.+?)# Answer\", md; overlapped=true)\n        push!(questions, strip(match.captures[1]))\n    end\n    \n    for match in eachmatch(r\"# Answer(.+?)$\", md; overlapped=true)\n        push!(answers, strip(match.captures[1]))\n    end\n    \n    return (join(questions, \"\\n\"), join(answers, \"\\n\"))\nend\n```\n\nIn this function:\n- `eachmatch` returns an iterator that yields matches of the given pattern in the string. The `overlapped=true` argument allows overlapping matches, which is necessary for extracting both the question and answer text from the same section.\n- `.+?` is a regular expression (regex) that matches any character (`.`) one or more times (`+`), but as few times as possible (`?`). This means it will stop at the first instance of `# Answer` encountered, allowing us to extract both the question and answer text from the same section.\n- `strip(match.captures[1])` removes leading spaces and newlines from the matched text.\n- The results are joined with newline characters (`\"\\n\"`) for easier reading.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is exactly one `# Question` and `# Answer` pair in each section of the markdown string, and that these markers appear at the start of a line (i.e., they do not appear inside other text). If your markdown strings can contain multiple sections or if they can be nested, you will need to modify this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[11,433],"elapsed":4.288136358,"_type":"aimessage"}]
