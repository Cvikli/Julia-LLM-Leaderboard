[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The problem can be solved using the `each_line` function to iterate over each line in the markdown string. Then, we check for lines starting with '# Question' or '# Answer', storing the subsequent lines as either the question or answer. Finally, after finding both parts of a Q&A section, we return them as a tuple.\n\nHere is how you can write this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    \n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_question && !isempty(line)\n            question *= lstrip(rstrip(line))\n        elseif in_answer && !isempty(line)\n            answer *= lstrip(rstrip(line))\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function uses a simple state machine to keep track of whether it's currently processing the question or the answer. The `lstrip` and `rstrip` functions are used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the lines before concatenating them into the question and answer strings.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the markdown string is formatted correctly, i.e., there will be exactly one \"# Question\" line followed by a single \"# Answer\" line for each Q&A section in the text. If there are multiple sections or no sections at all, you may need to add additional error handling logic to handle those cases appropriately.","status":200,"tokens":[11,395],"elapsed":3.945972631,"_type":"aimessage"}]
