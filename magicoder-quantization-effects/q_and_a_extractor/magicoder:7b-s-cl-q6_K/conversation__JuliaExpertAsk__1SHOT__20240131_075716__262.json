The `re.DOTALL` flag allows `.` in the regex to match any character, including newlines. \n\nThe function then strips leading spaces and newlines from both the question and answer using the `strip()` method. If no question or answer is found, it returns a tuple of two empty strings.","status":200,"tokens":[128,209],"elapsed":2.020079518,"_type":"aimessage"}]
