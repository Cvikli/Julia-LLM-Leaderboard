[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example solution using the `Markdown` package for parsing markdown:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_question && !isempty(line)\n            question *= line[end] == ' ' ? line[2:end] : line\n        elseif in_answer && !isempty(line)\n            answer *= line[end] == ' ' ? line[2:end] : line\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return strip(question), strip(answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the markdown text into lines and scanning each line. If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\", it switches on to collecting question text until it encounters another section header or reaches the end of the text. Similarly, if it encounters a line that starts with \"# Answer\", it switches off from collecting question text and on to answer text until it encounters another section header or reaches the end of the text. It also skips empty lines.\n\nNote: This function assumes that there is exactly one `# Question` and one `# Answer` in the markdown text, and that these sections are not nested within other headers. If your markdown can have multiple questions or answers, or if they can be nested within each other, you'll need to adjust this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,410],"elapsed":4.037494302,"_type":"aimessage"}]
