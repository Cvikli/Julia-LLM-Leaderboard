Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

The argument `re.DOTALL` is used to make `.` match any character, including newlines. The `strip()` method is then called on each extracted string to remove leading spaces and newlines.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes there will only be one instance of `# Question` and `# Answer` in the markdown text. If your markdown can contain multiple questions or answers, you may need a more sophisticated approach.","status":200,"tokens":[0,236],"elapsed":2.266541486,"_type":"aimessage"}]
