[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split by lines\n    md_lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    \n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    \n    for line in md_lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\") \n            in_question = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\") \n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        # If we are in a question or answer and the line is not empty\n        if (in_question || in_answer) && !isempty(line)\n            # Add spaces back to preserve indentation\n            if in_question \n                question *= line\n            elseif in_answer \n                answer *= line\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nIn this function, we are splitting the markdown text into lines and iterating over each line. If a line starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`, it sets the corresponding flag to `true`. If it is within a question or answer and the line is not empty, it appends the stripped line to the current section (question or answer).\n\nRemember that this function will treat all text after `# Question` or `# Answer` as a single paragraph. If your markdown has multiple paragraphs for questions and answers, you would need to modify the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,360],"elapsed":3.57735177,"_type":"aimessage"}]
