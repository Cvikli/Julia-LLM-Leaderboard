[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_question && !startswith(line, \" \")\n            question *= line\n        elseif in_answer && !startswith(line, \" \")\n            answer *= line\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function splits the markdown string into lines and iterates over each one. When it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it sets a flag to indicate which section it is currently in and continues on to the next line. If it's in the question section, any lines that don't start with a space are added to the question string; if it's in the answer section, any lines that don't start with a space are added to the answer string. The `strip` function is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,319],"elapsed":3.053427141,"_type":"aimessage"}]
