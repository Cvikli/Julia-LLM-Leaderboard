Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution using Python's built-in `re` module for regular expressions:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = re.findall(r'\\n# Question(.*?)# Answer', md, re.DOTALL)\n    answer = re.findall(r'# Answer(.*)', md)\n    \n    if len(question) > 0:\n        # Remove leading spaces and newlines\n        question = question[0].strip()\n    else:\n        question = None\n        \n    if len(answer) > 0:\n        # Remove leading spaces and newlines\n        answer = answer[0].strip()\n    else:\n        answer = None\n    \n    return (question, answer)\n```\nThis function works by first using `re.findall` to find all text within the `# Question` and `# Answer` sections of your markdown text. The argument `re.DOTALL` is used to make `.` in the regular expression match any character including newline characters.\n\nThen, it checks if there are multiple matches for each section (which would mean there were multiple instances of either \"Question\" or \"Answer\"), and if so, it takes only the first one. The `strip()` function is then used to remove leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text. \n\nFinally, it returns a tuple containing the question and answer. If no question or answer was found, None will be returned in their place.","status":200,"tokens":[0,333],"elapsed":3.209253345,"_type":"aimessage"}]
