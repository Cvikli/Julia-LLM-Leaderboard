[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might solve this problem using Julia's built-in string processing and regular expression capabilities:\n```julia\nimport Base.Regex\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question = strip(match(r\"# Question(.+?)# Answer\", md; group=1).match)\n    answer   = strip(match(r\"# Answer(.+?)$\", md; group=1).match)\n    \n    if isempty(question) || isempty(answer)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Missing either the question or the answer.\"))\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function first uses a regular expression to match the text between `# Question` and `# Answer`, and `match(r\"# Question(.+?)# Answer\", md; group=1).match` will capture everything after \"# Question\" until before \"# Answer\". The strip function is used to remove leading spaces or newlines.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes the markdown format always follows the pattern: `# Question` followed by text, then `# Answer`, followed by text. If your input might not follow this pattern, you'll need a different approach (possibly using a more complex regular expression).","status":200,"tokens":[0,281],"elapsed":2.782949978,"_type":"aimessage"}]
