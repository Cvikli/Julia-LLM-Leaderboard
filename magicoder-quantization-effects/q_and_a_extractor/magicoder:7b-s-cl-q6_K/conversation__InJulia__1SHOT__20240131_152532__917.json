[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can implement this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestion = false\n    inAnswer = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestion = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inAnswer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if inQuestion && !startswith(line, \" \")\n            question *= line[2:end]\n        elseif inAnswer && !startswith(line, \" \")\n            answer *= line[2:end]\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function splits the input string `md` into lines and then iterates over each line. If a line starts with `# Question`, it sets the flag `inQuestion` to true and continues to the next line. Similarly, if a line starts with `# Answer`, it sets the flag `inAnswer` to true and continues to the next line. If both flags are true (i.e., we're currently inside a question or an answer), it appends the text of that line to the corresponding variable (`question` or `answer`). The `strip` function is used to remove any leading spaces or newlines from the extracted text before returning them in a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,336],"elapsed":3.220921397,"_type":"aimessage"}]
