[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might write this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    in_question = false\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n        elseif in_question\n            question *= strip(line)\n        else\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the input string `md` into a list of lines using `split`. It then goes through each line, checking if it's the start of either a question or an answer section. If so, it sets a flag accordingly. If the line is not in any section but it's part of a question or answer text, it appends it to the appropriate string after stripping leading spaces and newlines. Finally, it returns a tuple containing both the cleaned-up question and answer strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,267],"elapsed":2.574755232,"_type":"aimessage"}]
