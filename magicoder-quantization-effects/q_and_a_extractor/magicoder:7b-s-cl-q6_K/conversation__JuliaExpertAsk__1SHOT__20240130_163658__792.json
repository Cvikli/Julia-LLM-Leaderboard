When it finds a line that starts with \"# Question\", it sets `extracting_question` to true and skips processing that line. Similarly for \"# Answer\".\n\nWhen `extracting_question` is true, it appends stripped content of current line to the question. Likewise when `extracting_answer` is true, it appends stripped content of current line to the answer. \n\nFinally, it returns a tuple with question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,322],"elapsed":3.11527325,"_type":"aimessage"}]
