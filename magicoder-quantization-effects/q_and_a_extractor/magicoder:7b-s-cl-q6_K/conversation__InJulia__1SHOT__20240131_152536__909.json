[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    \n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_question && !startswith(line, \" \")\n            question *= line[2:end]\n        elseif in_answer && !startswith(line, \" \")\n            answer *= line[2:end]\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function uses a simple state machine to keep track of whether it's currently inside the Question or Answer sections. It splits the input string into lines and processes each line individually, checking if it starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If so, it toggles the corresponding boolean flag and continues with the next line. Otherwise, it checks if it's in either section (by looking at the boolean flags) and if so, adds the text to the appropriate variable after stripping any leading spaces. Finally, it returns a tuple of the question and answer, both stripped of leading/trailing whitespace.","status":200,"tokens":[0,330],"elapsed":3.164180649,"_type":"aimessage"}]
