Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia solution using regular expressions to match the sections:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    m = match(r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n# Answer\\n(.*)\", md, dotall=true)\n    if m !== nothing\n        question = strip(m.captures[1])\n        answer = strip(m.captures[2])\n        return (question,answer)\n    else\n        return (\"No Question found\", \"No Answer found\")\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function works by using a regular expression to match the `# Question` and `# Answer` sections of your markdown text, and then extracting the text between those markers. It uses `strip()` to remove leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text. If no question or answer is found in the input string, it returns default strings \"No Question found\" and \"No Answer found\".\n\nYou can test this function with your example like so:\n```julia\nmd = \"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n# Answer\\nThe capital of France is Paris.\"\n@show q_and_a_extractor(md)\n```\nThis should output `(question=\"What is the capital of France?\", answer=\"The capital of France is Paris.\")`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,292],"elapsed":2.83340557,"_type":"aimessage"}]
