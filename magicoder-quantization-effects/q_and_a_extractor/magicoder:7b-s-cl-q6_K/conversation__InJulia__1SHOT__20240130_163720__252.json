Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple Julia program that accomplishes this task using regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    q_match = match(r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n\", md, re.MULTILINE | re.DOTALL)\n    a_match = match(r\"# Answer\\n(.*?)\\n\", md, re.MULTILINE | re.DOTALL)\n    \n    question = strip(q_match != nothing ? q_match.captures[1] : \"\")\n    answer   = strip(a_match != nothing ? a_match.captures[1] : \"\")\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses two regular expressions to match the lines that start with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively. It captures the text following these lines into `q_match` and `a_match`. If a match is found, it extracts the captured text (which includes leading newlines and spaces) and strips them using `strip()`. The function finally returns a tuple containing the question and answer after stripping the unwanted characters. \n\nThis program assumes that each `# Question` or `# Answer` section occupies a single paragraph in the markdown text, as indicated by the newline (`\\n`) character separating these sections from subsequent content.","status":200,"tokens":[0,305],"elapsed":2.950093461,"_type":"aimessage"}]
