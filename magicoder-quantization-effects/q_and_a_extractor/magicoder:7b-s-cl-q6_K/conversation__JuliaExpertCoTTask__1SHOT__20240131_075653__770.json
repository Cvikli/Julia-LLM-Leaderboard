Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple solution using regular expressions in Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = re.findall(r'\\n# Question(.*?)(?=\\n# Answer|\\Z)', md, re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE)[0].strip()\n    answer = re.findall(r'\\n# Answer(.*?)(?=\\n# Question|\\Z)', md, re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE)[0].strip()\n    return (question,answer)\n\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n\\n# Answer The capital of France is Paris.\"))\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all text between `# Question` and `# Answer` sections. `re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE` makes sure that `.` matches any character including newline and `(?=\\n# Question|\\Z)` ensures we stop at the next `# Question` or end of string.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that there is exactly one question and answer in the markdown text, and that they are separated by a blank line (two consecutive newlines). If your data can have multiple questions/answers or no blank lines between them, you'll need to adjust the regular expressions accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,306],"elapsed":2.961820696,"_type":"aimessage"}]
