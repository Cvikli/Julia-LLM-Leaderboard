[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestion = false\n    inAnswer = false\n\n    for line in split(strip(md), '\\n')\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestion = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inAnswer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if inQuestion && !startswith(line, \"```\")\n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif inAnswer && !startswith(line, \"```\")\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each line in the markdown. If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\", it sets `inQuestion` to true and skips the rest of this loop iteration. Similarly if it finds a line starting with \"# Answer\" it sets `inAnswer` to true and skips the rest of this loop iteration. It then adds the text on these lines to either `question` or `answer`. If a line starts with \"```\", it means that the current section (either Question or Answer) is ending, so it stops adding to this section's text.\n\nThis function assumes that each question ends with an answer and vice versa - if there are multiple questions and answers intermingled without explicit delimiters, it will not work correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,346],"elapsed":3.342940859,"_type":"aimessage"}]
