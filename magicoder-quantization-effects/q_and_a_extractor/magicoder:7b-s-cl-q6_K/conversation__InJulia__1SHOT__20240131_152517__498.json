Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Split the markdown into lines\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    \n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestionSection = false\n    inAnswerSection = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestionSection = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inAnswerSection = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if inQuestionSection && !startswith(line, \" \")\n            # This is the start of a new question section. Reset the question text\n            inQuestionSection = false\n            \n        elseif inQuestionSection\n            # Add this line to the question text\n            question *= strip(line)\n        \n        end\n        \n        if inAnswerSection && !startswith(line, \" \")\n            # This is the start of a new answer section. Reset the answer text\n            inAnswerSection = false\n            \n        elseif inAnswerSection\n            # Add this line to the answer text\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        \n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function goes through each line of the markdown. If it encounters a line starting with \"# Question\", it starts recording the question in `question`. Similarly, if it sees a line starting with \"# Answer\", it starts recording the answer in `answer`. It continues to record until it encounters another section header (i.e., a line that doesn't start with \" \").\n\nNote: This function assumes that there is only one question and one answer in the markdown, and that there are no other sections starting with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If your markdown has multiple questions/answers or additional sections, you may need to modify this code to handle those cases appropriately.","status":200,"tokens":[98,450],"elapsed":4.365488687,"_type":"aimessage"}]
