Then we iterate over each line and check if it starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`. If so, we change our state accordingly. We then append any non-empty lines to either `question` or `answer`, depending on whether we're in the question section or not. Finally, we return a tuple of the extracted text.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is only one `# Question` and one `# Answer` in your markdown string. If you have multiple questions or answers per string, you would need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,292],"elapsed":2.806931383,"_type":"aimessage"}]
