If so, it checks if the text starts with \"Question\" or \"Answer\", strips leading spaces and returns the extracted question and answer as a tuple.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that each Question and Answer are in separate headers, not combined within one.","status":200,"tokens":[0,310],"elapsed":2.970498898,"_type":"aimessage"}]
