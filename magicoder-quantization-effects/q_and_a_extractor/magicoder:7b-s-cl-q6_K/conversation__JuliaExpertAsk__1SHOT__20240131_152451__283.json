If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\", it sets `in_question` to true and continues to the next iteration. Similarly, if it encounters a line that starts with \"# Answer\", it sets `in_answer` to true and continues to the next iteration.\n\nIf the current line is within a question or answer section (i.e., `in_question` or `in_answer` is true) and does not start with a space, it appends the content of that line to the corresponding variable (`question` or `answer`).\n\nFinally, it returns a tuple containing the stripped question and answer strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,361],"elapsed":3.475571165,"_type":"aimessage"}]
