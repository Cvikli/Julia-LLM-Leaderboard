[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function that uses regular expressions to find the sections of the markdown text labeled as \"Question\" and \"Answer\". It then strips any leading spaces or newlines from these sections before returning them in a tuple:\n\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Find the start of the question and answer sections\n    match = match(r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n# Answer\\n(.*?)(\\n#.*|\\Z)\", md, re.MULTILINE | re.DOTALL)\n    \n    if match === nothing\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Markdown does not contain a 'Question' and 'Answer' section.\"))\n    end\n\n    # Extract the question and answer text\n    question = strip(match[1])\n    answer = strip(match[2])\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function assumes that there is only one \"Question\" and \"Answer\" section in the markdown. If there are multiple sections of each type, it will only consider the first one it finds. If the markdown does not contain a 'Question' and 'Answer' section, it throws an error. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the markdown is well-formatted with '#' signifying headers and new lines separating different sections. If your markdown has different formatting, you may need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,327],"elapsed":3.207288409,"_type":"aimessage"}]
