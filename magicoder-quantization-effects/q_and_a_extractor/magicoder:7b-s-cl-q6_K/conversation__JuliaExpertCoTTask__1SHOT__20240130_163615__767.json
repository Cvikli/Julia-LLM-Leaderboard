When it encounters a line starting with \"# Question\", it starts recording the question and skips to the next line. Similarly, when it encounters a line starting with \"# Answer\", it stops recording the question and starts recording the answer. It continues until reaching the end of the input string.\n\nThe `strip` function is used to remove any leading spaces or newlines from the recorded text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,270],"elapsed":2.64237033,"_type":"aimessage"}]
