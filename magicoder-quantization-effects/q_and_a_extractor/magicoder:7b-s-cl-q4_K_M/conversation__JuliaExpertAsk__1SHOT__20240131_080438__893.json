[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise. You're precise and answer only when you're confident in the high quality of your answer.","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Question\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might write this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestion = false\n    inAnswer = false\n    \n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestion = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inAnswer = true\n        elseif inQuestion && !startswith(line, \" \")\n            question *= line[2:end]\n        elseif inAnswer && !startswith(line, \" \")\n            answer *= line[2:end]\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each line of the markdown text. If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\", it sets `inQuestion` to true and continues reading lines until it finds a line that doesn't start with \" \". Similarly, if it encounters a line that starts with \"# Answer\", it sets `inAnswer` to true and continues reading lines until it finds a line that doesn't start with \" \". Any other lines are ignored. The text is then concatenated onto the question or answer string after stripping any leading spaces or newlines.\n\nPlease note, this function assumes that there will be exactly one \"# Question\" and one \"# Answer\" in the markdown. If there might not be either of these, you'll need to add error checking code to handle those cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,356],"elapsed":2.990686016,"_type":"aimessage"}]
