Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can implement this function using Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = ''\n    answer = ''\n    \n    lines = md.split('\\n')\n    for i in range(len(lines)):\n        if '# Question' in lines[i]:\n            question = lines[i+1].strip()\n        elif '# Answer' in lines[i]:\n            answer = '\\n'.join(lines[i+1:]).strip()\n    \n    return (question,answer)\n```\nThis function splits the markdown text into lines and iterates over them. If it encounters a line with `# Question` or `# Answer`, it sets the corresponding variable to the next line's contents after stripping leading spaces. The answer is set to all subsequent lines joined together. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there will be only one question and one answer in the markdown text, and that they are separated by a blank line. If these assumptions do not hold true for your use case, you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[128,250],"elapsed":2.014401353,"_type":"aimessage"}]
