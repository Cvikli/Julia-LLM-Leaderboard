[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function that achieves this using Julia's built-in Markdown parsing capabilities:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(strip(md), '\\n') # Split the markdown into lines\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"  # Initialize variables to hold the question and answer\n    in_question, in_answer = false, false  # Flags to track whether we're currently in a Question or Answer section\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n        elseif in_question && startswith(line, \" \")  # Check if this is a continuation of the question\n            question *= line[2:end]\n        elseif in_answer && startswith(line, \" \")  # Check if this is a continuation of the answer\n            answer *= line[2:end]\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))  # Return the question and answer stripped of leading/trailing whitespace\nend\n```\nThis function goes through each line in the markdown. If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\", it sets `in_question` to true, meaning we're about to start capturing the question. Similarly, if it sees a line starting with \"# Answer\", it sets `in_answer` to true.\n\nIf `in_question` is true and the current line starts with a space (i.e., it's part of the question), it appends the content of that line to the `question`. If `in_answer` is true and the current line starts with a space, it appends the content of that line to the `answer`.\n\nOnce it has gone through all lines, it returns the question and answer stripped of leading/trailing whitespace.","status":200,"tokens":[0,442],"elapsed":3.633925972,"_type":"aimessage"}]
