The `capture=true` argument means that it should capture everything inside these sections. After extraction, it strips any leading spaces and newlines using the `replace()` function and returns the question and answer in a tuple.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes there is only one `# Question` and `# Answer` section in the markdown text, and the order of them is correct. If there are multiple sections or they're not in the right order, you may need to adjust the pattern accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,279],"elapsed":2.236130962,"_type":"aimessage"}]
