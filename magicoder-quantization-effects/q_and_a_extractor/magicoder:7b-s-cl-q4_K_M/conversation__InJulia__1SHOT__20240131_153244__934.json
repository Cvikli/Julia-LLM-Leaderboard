Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can do this using regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nusing REPL.REPLCompletions\nimport Base.Docs: splitdef\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = match(r\"# Question(.*?)# Answer\", md, re\"s\") |> m -> chomp(m.match)\n    answer = match(r\"# Answer(.*)\", md, re\"s\") |> m -> chomp(m.match)\n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nIn this function `q_and_a_extractor`, we use the `match` function to look for the sections of the markdown that start with `# Question` and `# Answer`. The regular expression `(.*?)` is used to match any character (except newline) between these two section delimiters, which will be our question and answer. \n\nThe `chomp` function removes leading spaces and newlines from the matched text.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that there are only one `# Question` and one `# Answer` in your markdown. If you have multiple sections for either of these, you may need to adjust the regular expression accordingly or add additional logic to handle them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,273],"elapsed":2.172264938,"_type":"aimessage"}]
