[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n        elseif in_question && !isempty(strip(line))\n            question *= strip(line) * \" \"\n        elseif in_answer && !isempty(strip(line))\n            answer *= strip(line) * \" \"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function splits the markdown text into lines and iterates through each line. If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\", it sets `in_question` to true and continues reading until it encounters a line starting with \"# Answer\". It then sets `in_answer` to true and reads until it encounters an empty line (after which the next question or answer will start). Any non-empty lines are appended to the current section of text.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that each `# Question` is followed by a single line of text, and likewise for `# Answer`. If there can be multiple lines following either directive, you'll need to adjust the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,342],"elapsed":2.736070782,"_type":"aimessage"}]
