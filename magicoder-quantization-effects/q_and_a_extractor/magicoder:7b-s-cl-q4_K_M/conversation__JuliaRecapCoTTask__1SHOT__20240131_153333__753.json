[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of this function using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(strip(md), '\\n') # Split the markdown into lines.\n    \n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    inQuestion = false \n    inAnswer = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\") # If this line marks the start of a question section.\n            inQuestion = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\") # If this line marks the start of an answer section.\n            inAnswer = true\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if inQuestion \n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif inAnswer\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer) # Return the extracted question and answer.\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating through each line of the markdown text, checking if it starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", and appending the stripped content to either `question` or `answer`. The variables `inQuestion` and `inAnswer` are used to keep track of whether we're currently in a question or an answer section.\n\nPlease note that this is a basic implementation and it might not cover all edge cases, such as handling multiple questions/answers per markdown file or handling sections that don't start with \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\". You may need to adjust the function according to your specific requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,347],"elapsed":2.843788304,"_type":"aimessage"}]
