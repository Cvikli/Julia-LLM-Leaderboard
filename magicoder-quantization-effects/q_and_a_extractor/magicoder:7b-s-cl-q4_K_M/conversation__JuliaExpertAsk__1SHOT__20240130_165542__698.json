Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might implement this function using Python's `re` library for regular expressions:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = None\n    answer = None\n    \n    lines = md.split('\\n')\n    for i in range(len(lines)):\n        if lines[i].strip() == '# Question':\n            question = ''\n            while lines[i+1].strip() != '## Answer' and i < len(lines) - 1:\n                question += lines[i+1].lstrip(' ') + '\\n'\n                i += 1\n        elif lines[i].strip() == '# Answer':\n            answer = ''\n            while i < len(lines) - 1:\n                answer += lines[i+1].lstrip(' ') + '\\n'\n                i += 1\n                \n    # remove leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text\n    question = re.sub('\\n\\s*', '\\n', question).strip() if question else None\n    answer = re.sub('\\n\\s*', '\\n', answer).strip() if answer else None\n    \n    return (question,answer)\n```\n\nThis function works by first splitting the markdown into lines and scanning each line to see whether it's the start of a Question or Answer section. Whenever it finds such a section, it accumulates all subsequent lines in the corresponding variable until it encounters a line that isn't part of the current section. It then removes leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text using regular expressions before returning the result as a tuple.\n\nPlease note this function assumes that there are no nested sections, i.e., `# Question` within an Answer or vice versa. If you need to handle nested sections, you'll need to modify it accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,415],"elapsed":3.364654105,"_type":"aimessage"}]
