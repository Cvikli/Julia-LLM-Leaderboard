Then, check if each line starts with '# Question' or '# Answer'. If it does, collect the subsequent lines until you find a line that doesn't start with these markers. Here is an example code:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    lines = split(md,\"\\n\")  # convert markdown to array of lines\n    current_section = \"\"   # initialize section\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            current_section = \"question\"\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            current_section = \"answer\"\n        elseif current_section == \"question\" && !isempty(strip(line))  # add to question only if line is not empty after stripping\n            question *= strip(line) * \"\\n\"   # add line with stripped leading spaces and newline character\n        elseif current_section == \"answer\" && !isempty(strip(line))\n            answer *= strip(line) * \"\\n\"    # same as above, but for the answer section\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question,answer)  # return tuple of question and answer\nend\n```\n\nYou can call this function like so: `q_and_a_extractor(\"\"\"# Question\\n This is a question.\\n # Answer\\n This is an answer.\"\"\")`. The result will be `( \"This is a question.\", \"This is an answer.\" )`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,370],"elapsed":2.990119312,"_type":"aimessage"}]
