If a line starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`, it sets the corresponding flag to `True`. If these flags are `True` and the line doesn't start with `#`, it appends the stripped line to either question or answer (after removing leading spaces). Finally, it returns a tuple of stripped strings for question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,331],"elapsed":2.66913687,"_type":"aimessage"}]
