Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might do this in Julia using the `Markdown.parse` function to parse the markdown text into an AbstractSyntaxTree (AST), then traverse that AST to find the question and answer sections:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    ast = Markdown.parse(md)\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    in_question, in_answer = false, false\n    \n    for block in ast\n        if isa(block, Markdown.Header) && block.level == 1 && startswith(block.content[1], \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n        elseif isa(block, Markdown.Header) && block.level == 1 && startswith(block.content[1], \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n        elseif in_question && isa(block, Markdown.Paragraph)\n            question *= strip(join(block.content))\n            in_question = false\n        elseif in_answer && isa(block, Markdown.Paragraph)\n            answer *= strip(join(block.content))\n            in_answer = false\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function will parse the markdown text and extract all text from paragraph blocks that come after headers with the content \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". The `strip` function is used to remove any leading spaces or newlines.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that there are no other header levels in your markdown document, and that each question and answer section starts on a new line following the `# Question` or `# Answer`. If these assumptions do not hold true for your documents, you may need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,400],"elapsed":3.204949734,"_type":"aimessage"}]
