[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function that uses regular expressions to extract the question and answer from the provided markdown text:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    matchq = match(r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n# Answer\", md, re\"s\")\n    matcha = match(r\"# Answer\\n(.*?)#\", md, re\"s\")\n    \n    if matchq === nothing || matcha === nothing\n        return \"No question or answer found in the input text.\"\n    end\n    \n    question = strip(matchq.captures[1])\n    answer   = strip(matcha.captures[1])\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function first attempts to match the markdown sections for \"Question\" and \"Answer\". If either of these sections are not found in `md`, a message is returned indicating that no question or answer was found. \n\nIf both sections are found, the text within them (excluding leading spaces) is extracted using the `.captures` field of the match object. This text is then stripped and returned as a tuple `(question,answer)`.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there will only be one instance of each section in `md`. If there may be multiple instances of either \"Question\" or \"Answer\", more complex parsing would be required.","status":200,"tokens":[0,307],"elapsed":2.510459873,"_type":"aimessage"}]
