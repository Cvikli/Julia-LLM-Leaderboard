Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution using regular expressions:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = re.findall(r'# Question(.*?)(?=\\n\\n|\\Z)', md, re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE)[0].strip()\n    answer = re.findall(r'# Answer(.*?)(?=\\n\\n|\\Z)', md, re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE)[0].strip()\n    return (question,answer)\n```\n\nThis function uses the `re` module to find all text between `# Question` and `# Answer` sections in the markdown string using regular expressions. The `?=` operator is a positive lookahead that matches the pattern before it without including it in the match result. The `\\n\\n|\\Z` part of the regex means \"either two newlines or end-of-string\". The `re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE` flags tell Python to treat the input string as a single line, so `.` matches any character including newline characters.\n\nThe `.strip()` function is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text. If there are multiple such sections in the markdown string, only the first one will be returned because of `re.findall()`. \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that each section (question or answer) starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`, and there is no other content before it on the same line. If your markdown strings can have different formats, you would need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[128,357],"elapsed":2.91759865,"_type":"aimessage"}]
