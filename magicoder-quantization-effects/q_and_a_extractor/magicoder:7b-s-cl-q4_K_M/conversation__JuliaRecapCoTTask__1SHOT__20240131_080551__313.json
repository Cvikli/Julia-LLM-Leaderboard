[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple solution using regular expressions to extract the question and answer sections:\n\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Find all sections starting with '#'\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"^(# [^\\n]*)\\n([\\s\\S]*?)(?=\\n^#{2,}|$)\", md; overlapping=false))\n    \n    # Extract the question and answer text\n    questions_and_answers = [(strip(m.captures[1]), strip(m.captures[2])) for m in matches]\n    \n    # Filter out sections that do not start with 'Question' or 'Answer'\n    filtered_questions_and_answers = [qa for qa in questions_and_answers if startswith(qa[1], \"Question\") || startswith(qa[1], \"Answer\")]\n    \n    return filtered_questions_and_answers\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `RegularExpressions` package to match sections of text that start with `#`. The `eachmatch` function returns an iterator over all matches, and we collect these into a list. Each match is a `Match` object which has two fields: `captures`, which is a tuple containing the captured substrings, and `offset`, which indicates where in the original string this match was found.\n\nThe `strip` function removes leading spaces and newlines from each section of text. Finally, we filter out sections that do not start with 'Question' or 'Answer'. \n\nPlease note that this code assumes that there is exactly one question and answer per markdown section. If there can be multiple questions/answers in a single section, you would need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,396],"elapsed":3.366400892,"_type":"aimessage"}]
