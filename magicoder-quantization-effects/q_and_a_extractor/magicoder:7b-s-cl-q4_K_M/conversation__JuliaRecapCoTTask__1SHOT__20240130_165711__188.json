[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, you can use the `eachmatch` function from Julia's base library to match lines in the markdown text. Here is a possible solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    # Split the input string by newlines and process each line\n    for (i,line) in enumerate(split(md,'\\n'))\n        if startswith(line,\"# Question\")\n            question = line[12:end]  # Remove \"# Question\" from the start of the line\n        elseif startswith(line,\"# Answer\")\n            answer = line[10:end]    # Remove \"# Answer\" from the start of the line\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Strip leading spaces and newline characters from each string\n    question = replace(question, \" \"*'\\n'=>'')  # Replace multiple spaces with a single space\n    answer = replace(answer, \"\\n\"=>' ')       # Replace newlines with a single space\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nThis function will iterate over each line of the markdown text. When it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it extracts the relevant text and strips any leading spaces or newline characters before storing them in `question` and `answer`, respectively. It returns these two strings as a tuple.\n\nNote: The \"Special Instructions\" are not incorporated into this solution, since the problem statement clearly outlines what the function should do. If there are specific instructions given for how to handle the markdown text, you would need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,375],"elapsed":3.190661952,"_type":"aimessage"}]
