Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem using Julia's Regular Expressions module:\n\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = match(r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n# Answer\", md, capture=true)[1] |> strip\n    answer = match(r\"# Answer\\n(.*?)\\n## Next Section\", md, capture=true)[1] |> strip\n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find the sections of text that start with `# Question` and `# Answer`. The `match` function returns a match object which can be indexed to get the captured text. The `|>` operator is used for function composition, it applies the function on the right to the result of the function on the left.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no other sections in your markdown file starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`. If such sections exist, you may need a more complex regular expression or additional logic to handle them correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,241],"elapsed":1.921575451,"_type":"aimessage"}]
