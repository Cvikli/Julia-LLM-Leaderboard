[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of `q_and_a_extractor` in Julia using regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question = match(r\"# Question(.*?)(?=\\n##)\", md, re.MULTILINE | re.DOTALL).match\n    answer = match(r\"## Answer(.*?)(?=\\n##|$)\", md, re.MULTILINE | re.DOTALL).match\n    \n    if question === nothing || answer === nothing\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Markdown does not contain either a # Question or an ## Answer section.\"))\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to find the sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`. The `match` function returns a match object, which can be accessed using `.match`. The `?=` in the regular expression is a positive lookahead assertion ensuring that the next character is not an instance of the preceding character. The `.*` in the regular expression matches any number (including zero) of any characters, and the `re.MULTILINE` flag allows matching to span multiple lines. The `re.DOTALL` flag makes the dot (`.`) match all characters including newline.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the markdown sections are on separate lines starting with `# Question` or `# Answer`, and that they do not overlap or mix with other text in the document. If you expect the input to contain overlapping or mixed sections, a more sophisticated approach may be needed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,367],"elapsed":3.06013449,"_type":"aimessage"}]
