Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use regular expressions (regex) to parse markdown format in Python, because python provides support for regex operations. Here's an example of how you might write this function:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    pattern = r'\\n# ([A-Za-z ]+)\\n(.*?)(?=\\n# [A-Za-z ]+|\\Z)'\n    matches = re.findall(pattern, md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    question_matches = [match[0].strip() for match in matches]\n    answer_matches = [match[1].strip() for match in matches]\n    \n    return tuple(zip(question_matches, answer_matches))\n``` \nThis function will extract the text between the `# Question` and `# Answer` sections into tuples of question/answer pairs. The `?=` syntax is a positive lookahead that asserts a position without consuming characters, so `(.*?)` matches all characters up to but not including the next `# [A-Za-z ]+` or the end of the string.\n\nThe `.strip()` function is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from each match. The `re.DOTALL` flag is necessary because by default, `.` does not match newline characters. This allows us to match across multiple lines if we use `(.*?)` instead of `.*`.","status":200,"tokens":[272,318],"elapsed":9.355378829,"_type":"aimessage"}]
