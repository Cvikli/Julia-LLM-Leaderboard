Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

If a line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it sets the corresponding flag to true and continues to the next line. If the current line is not a header and the question/answer flags are still active, it appends the stripped content of the line to the question/answer string. The function returns a tuple of strings representing the question and answer respectively.","status":200,"tokens":[0,289],"elapsed":2.302628486,"_type":"aimessage"}]
