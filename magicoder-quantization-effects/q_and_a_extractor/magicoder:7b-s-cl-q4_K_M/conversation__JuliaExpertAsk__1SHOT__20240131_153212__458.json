Then it extracts the text between these markers and strips any leading spaces or newlines from the extracted text. If both sections exist and are not empty, it returns a tuple of the question and answer. Otherwise, it throws an error.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is only one `# Question` and one `# Answer` section in `md`, and that these sections do not overlap or contain each other. If your markdown can have multiple sections or they can overlap, you would need a more sophisticated approach to extract the correct question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,387],"elapsed":3.08537988,"_type":"aimessage"}]
