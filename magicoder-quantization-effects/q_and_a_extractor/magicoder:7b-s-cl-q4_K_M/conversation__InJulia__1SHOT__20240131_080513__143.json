[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could implement this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n        elseif in_question && !isempty(line)\n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif in_answer && !isempty(line)\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the input markdown string into lines and iterating over each line. If a line starts with \"# Question\", it sets `in_question` to true and continues reading lines until it encounters another section header or an empty line. Similarly, if a line starts with \"# Answer\", it sets `in_answer` to true and reads lines into the answer variable until it encounters another section header or an empty line. All other lines are ignored. The `strip(line)` function is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from each line of text before concatenating them into the question or answer strings.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there will always be a Question followed by an Answer in the markdown string, and it does not handle cases where there might be other sections or noisy lines between the Question and Answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,359],"elapsed":2.875952723,"_type":"aimessage"}]
