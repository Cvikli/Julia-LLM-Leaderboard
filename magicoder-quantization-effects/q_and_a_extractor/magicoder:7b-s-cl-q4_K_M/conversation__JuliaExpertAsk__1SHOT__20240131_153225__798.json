If a line starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`, it sets the appropriate flag and continues to the next line. Otherwise, if the flag is set, it appends the line to the question or answer (after stripping leading spaces and newlines). At the end of the function, it returns a tuple of the extracted question and answer text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,314],"elapsed":2.525904243,"_type":"aimessage"}]
