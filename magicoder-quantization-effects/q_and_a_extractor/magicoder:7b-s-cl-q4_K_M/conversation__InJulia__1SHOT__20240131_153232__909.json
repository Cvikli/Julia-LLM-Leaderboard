When it sees a line starting with \"# Question\", it starts recording the question text. When it sees a line starting with \"# Answer\", it starts recording the answer text. It continues this until it encounters another line that starts with either of these, at which point it stops recording that section of text.\n\nIf you want to ensure that every line in the question and answer sections start with a space (to exclude lines that might be part of the surrounding markdown), change `!startswith(line, \" \")` to `!startswith(line, \"\\t \") || !startswith(line, \"  \")`.","status":200,"tokens":[98,313],"elapsed":2.51019363,"_type":"aimessage"}]
