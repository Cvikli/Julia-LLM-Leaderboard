The `captures` field of the returned match object is a tuple containing all captured substrings. \n\nThe `[^\\n]+` part of the regex matches any character that is not a newline (thus, it will stop at the next newline). Finally, `strip(question)` and `strip(answer)` are used to remove leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,219],"elapsed":1.774346796,"_type":"aimessage"}]
