[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    found_question = false\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            found_question = true\n            continue\n        elseif found_question && startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            break\n        end\n        if found_question && !startswith(line, \"# \")\n            question *= line\n        end\n    end\n    for line in reverse(lines)\n        if startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            break\n        end\n        answer = line * answer\n    end\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nThis function first splits the markdown into lines and loops through them. When it finds a line that starts with `# Question`, it knows to start collecting text for the question, and when it finds a line starting with `# Answer`, it stops collecting for the question and starts collecting for the answer. It skips any lines that have `#` followed by spaces (which would be other sections in markdown), and once it's done collecting both pieces, it strips leading spaces and newlines from each piece and returns them as a tuple.\n\nNote that this assumes that there is exactly one question and one answer, and they are separated by lines with `# Question` or `# Answer`, and nothing else in between. It also doesn't handle cases where the question or answer has multiple paragraphs or line breaks inside it (it just appends all subsequent non-section lines to the question/answer), nor does it handle errors if there's no such section in the markdown.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question \nThis is a question.\n# Answer\nThis is an answer.\n\"\"\"\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md)) # should print (\"This is a question.\", \"This is an answer.\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[98,485],"elapsed":3.956768046,"_type":"aimessage"}]
