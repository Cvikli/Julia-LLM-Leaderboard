If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\", it sets `in_question` to true and continues to the next line. Similarly, if it encounters a line that starts with \"# Answer\", it sets `in_answer` to true and continues to the next line.\n\nIf it is in a question section (`in_question == true`) and the line is not empty after stripping leading/trailing whitespace, it appends the stripped line to the `question`. If it is in an answer section (`in_answer == true`) and the line is not empty, it appends the stripped line to the `answer`.\n\nFinally, once all lines have been processed, it returns a tuple of the question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,365],"elapsed":2.931514844,"_type":"aimessage"}]
