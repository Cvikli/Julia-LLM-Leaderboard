Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Python solution for your problem:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = re.findall(r'\\n# Question(.*?)# Answer', md, re.DOTALL)[0].strip()\n    answer = re.findall(r'# Answer(.*)', md, re.DOTALL)[0].strip()\n    return (question,answer)\n\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n# Answer The capital of France is Paris.\"))\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to find the sections for question and answer. `re.DOTALL` flag is used so that `.` can match any character including newlines. The `.strip()` method is used to remove leading spaces and newline characters from the extracted text.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes there will be exactly one question and one answer section in your input markdown string, and it does not handle cases where those sections might contain multiple lines or other special characters. If you need a more robust solution, you'll need to adjust the regular expressions accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,254],"elapsed":2.034006163,"_type":"aimessage"}]
