[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's an example of how you might write such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String; instructions=\"\")\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestion = false\n    inAnswer = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\") \n            inQuestion = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inAnswer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if inQuestion\n            question *= lstrip(rstrip(line))\n        elseif inAnswer\n            answer *= lstrip(rstrip(line))\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function splits the input `md` into lines and iterates through each line. It checks if the current line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", and accordingly sets flags for the question and answer sections. \n\nIf the line is in either of these sections, it concatenates the stripped line to the relevant section's text (the question or answer).\n\nAt the end, it returns a tuple of strings, where the first string is the extracted question and the second string is the extracted answer. This assumes that each `# Question` or `# Answer` is on its own line. If there are multiple lines in these sections, you would need to adjust how this function handles them.\n\nPlease note, the instructions parameter does not have an effect on this solution and can be omitted if it's not needed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,359],"elapsed":3.051125824,"_type":"aimessage"}]
