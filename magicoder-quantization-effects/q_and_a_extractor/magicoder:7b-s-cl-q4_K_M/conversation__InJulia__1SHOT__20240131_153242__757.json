[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could write this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    \n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_question && !isempty(strip(line))\n            question *= strip(line) * \" \"\n        elseif in_answer && !isempty(strip(line))\n            answer *= strip(line) * \" \"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function splits the input markdown string into lines and then iterates over these lines. It checks if a line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", indicating that it's part of the respective section. If so, it sets the corresponding flag to `true` and continues to the next line. \n\nIf the line is not empty (i.e., it contains actual text) and the appropriate flag is set, it appends this stripped line to either the question or answer string. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,323],"elapsed":2.570033523,"_type":"aimessage"}]
