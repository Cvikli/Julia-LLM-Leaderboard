[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible solution using Julia's regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = match(r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n# Answer\", md, re\"s\")[1]\n    answer = match(r\"# Answer\\n(.*)\", md, re\"s\")[1]\n    \n    # Remove leading spaces and newlines\n    question = replace(question, r\"^[ \\t]*\\n\" => \"\")\n    answer = replace(answer, r\"^[ \\t]*\\n\" => \"\")\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nIn the above function:\n- `match` is used to find the text between `# Question` and `# Answer`. The `.*?` in the regular expression makes it non-greedy, i.e., it will stop at the first `# Answer` it encounters.\n- `replace` is used to remove any leading spaces or newlines from the extracted text.\n\nThis function assumes that there's only one question and answer in the markdown string. If there can be multiple questions and answers, you might want to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,269],"elapsed":2.206967831,"_type":"aimessage"}]
