The `.match` property of the Match object is used to extract the actual matched text. \n\nPlease note that this code assumes that there are exactly two sections, '# Question' and '# Answer', one after the other and does not handle scenarios where these sections could be interspersed or missing in the input string. \n\nAlso please ensure that your markdown string is formatted correctly for this to work.","status":200,"tokens":[0,275],"elapsed":2.233227889,"_type":"aimessage"}]
