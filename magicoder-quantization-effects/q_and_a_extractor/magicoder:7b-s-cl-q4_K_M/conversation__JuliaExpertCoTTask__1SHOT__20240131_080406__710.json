Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple Python solution using regular expressions:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = re.findall(r'\\n# Question(.+?)\\n', md, re.DOTALL)[0].strip()\n    answer = re.findall(r'\\n# Answer(.+?)\\n', md, re.DOTALL)[0].strip()\n    return question, answer\n\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n\\n# Answer\\nThe capital of France is Paris.\"))\n```\nThis script uses regular expressions to find all text between `# Question` and `# Answer`, which are assumed to be on separate lines. The `re.DOTALL` flag makes `.` match any character, including newline characters. The `strip()` function removes leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text. \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes there is only one question and answer in the markdown string. If there are multiple questions or answers, you may need a different approach.","status":200,"tokens":[0,244],"elapsed":2.025478563,"_type":"aimessage"}]
