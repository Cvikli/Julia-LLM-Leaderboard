Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can solve this problem using Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    # Find all sections starting with '# Question' and '# Answer'\n    matches = re.findall('^# (Question|Answer)\\n(.*?)(?=\\n^# |$)', md, re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE)\n    \n    # Extract the question and answer text\n    question = '' if len(matches) < 1 or matches[0][0] != 'Question' else matches[0][1].strip()\n    answer = '' if len(matches) < 1 or matches[0][0] != 'Answer' else matches[0][1].strip()\n    \n    return (question,answer)\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to match the sections of markdown text. The `^` character is used to start a pattern at the beginning of each line. The `.` character is used to match any character except for newline. The `*` character is used to match 0 or more occurrences of the preceding element, and the `?` makes it non-greedy so that it will stop matching as soon as possible.\n\nThe `re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE` flags are used to make `.` match any character including newline (`\\n`) and to make `^` start at the beginning of each line, not just the start of the string.\n\nThis function assumes that there is only one section starting with '# Question' or '# Answer'. If there can be multiple sections in the markdown text, you would need a different approach to extract them all.","status":200,"tokens":[0,368],"elapsed":3.071782355,"_type":"aimessage"}]
