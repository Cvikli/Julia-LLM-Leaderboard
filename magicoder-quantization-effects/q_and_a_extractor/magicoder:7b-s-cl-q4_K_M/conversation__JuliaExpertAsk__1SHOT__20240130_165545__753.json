If it does, we extract the text following the `#` symbol using the `split` function, strip any leading spaces/newlines from the extracted text using `strip`, and append to our `question` or `answer` variable. Finally, we return a tuple of the question and answer.\n\nYou can call this function with your markdown string as follows:\n\n```julia\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Question 1\nThis is a sample question.\n# Answer 1\nThis is a sample answer to question 1.\n\n# Question 2\nAnother question?\n# Answer 2\nThe answer for question 2 goes here.\n\"\"\"\n\nq,a = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\nprintln(\"Question: $q\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $a\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,359],"elapsed":2.89931768,"_type":"aimessage"}]
