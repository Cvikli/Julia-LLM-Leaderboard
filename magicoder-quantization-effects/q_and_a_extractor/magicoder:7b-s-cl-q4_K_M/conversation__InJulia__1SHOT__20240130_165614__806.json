If it encounters `# Question` or `# Answer`, it switches on and off flags to indicate whether the following lines belong to a question or an answer respectively. Then it appends each non-empty line of text to either the question or answer string, stripping leading spaces and newlines from all lines. Finally, it returns a tuple with the extracted question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,287],"elapsed":2.296823862,"_type":"aimessage"}]
