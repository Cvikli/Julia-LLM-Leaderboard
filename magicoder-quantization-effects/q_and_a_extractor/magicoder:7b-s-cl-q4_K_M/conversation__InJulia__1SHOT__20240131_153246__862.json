[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could implement this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(strip(md), \"\\n\")\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    inQuestion = false\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestion = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inQuestion = false\n        elseif inQuestion && !isempty(line)\n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif !inQuestion && !isempty(line)\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nThis function splits the markdown text into lines and iterates over each line. If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\", it sets `inQuestion` to true. If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Answer\", it sets `inQuestion` to false. Any other lines are added to either `question` or `answer`, depending on the current state of `inQuestion`.\n\nNote: This is a very simple solution and may not work perfectly for all types of markdown files, especially those that contain nested sections or have different ways of delimiting questions/answers. A more robust solution would involve using a proper Markdown parser library in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[0,307],"elapsed":2.445933445,"_type":"aimessage"}]
