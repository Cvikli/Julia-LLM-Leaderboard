Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution using regular expressions:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = re.findall(r'# Question(.*?)# Answer', md, re.DOTALL)\n    answer = re.findall(r'# Answer(.*?)(?=\\n*?(?:# Question|$)|\\Z)', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # Strip leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text\n    question = [re.sub('\\s*\\n\\s*',' ', q).strip() for q in question] if question else None\n    answer = [re.sub('\\s*\\n\\s*',' ', a).strip() for a in answer] if answer else None\n    \n    return (question,answer)\n```\n\nThis function first uses regular expressions to find all text between `# Question` and `# Answer`, and between `# Answer` and the next `# Question` or end of file. It then strips leading spaces and newlines from each extracted section using a list comprehension with `re.sub`. The function returns these sections as a tuple `(question,answer)`.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that there is only one question and answer pair in the markdown text. If there are multiple pairs, you may need to modify the regular expressions or add additional logic to handle them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,301],"elapsed":2.525843369,"_type":"aimessage"}]
