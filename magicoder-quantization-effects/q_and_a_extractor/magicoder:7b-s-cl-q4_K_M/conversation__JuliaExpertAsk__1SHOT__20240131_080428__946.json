Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

The `re.findall()` method returns a list of matches, so we take the first element from these lists. The `.strip()` method is used to remove any leading spaces or newlines. If no question or answer is found, the function will return `None`.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that there is only one Question and Answer section in your markdown text. If you have multiple sections, you would need a different approach (possibly using more complex parsing).","status":200,"tokens":[0,233],"elapsed":1.951276963,"_type":"aimessage"}]
