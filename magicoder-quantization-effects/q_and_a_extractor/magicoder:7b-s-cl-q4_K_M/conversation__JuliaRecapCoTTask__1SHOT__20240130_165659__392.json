[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution written in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestionBlock = false\n    inAnswerBlock = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestionBlock = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inQuestionBlock = false\n            inAnswerBlock = true\n        end\n        \n        if inQuestionBlock\n            question *= lstrip(rstrip(line))\n        elseif inAnswerBlock\n            answer *= lstrip(rstrip(line))\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nThis function splits the input markdown `md` into lines and scans each line. If a line starts with `# Question`, it switches to the question block and continues to append the text until another `# Question` or `# Answer` is encountered. The same process is done for answer. \n\nThe `lstrip(rstrip(line))` function is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from the extracted lines. Finally, the function returns a tuple of the question and answer.\n\nThe `{{instructions}}` placeholder in your text will be replaced with actual instructions when calling this function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,308],"elapsed":2.5672981,"_type":"aimessage"}]
