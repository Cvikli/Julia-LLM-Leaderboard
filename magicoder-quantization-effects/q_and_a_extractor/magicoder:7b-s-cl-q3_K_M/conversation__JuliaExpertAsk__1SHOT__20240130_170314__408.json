Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is one way you could write such function `q_and_a_extractor`:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Find index of the line containing \"# Question\"\n    question_index = findfirst(isequal(\"# Question\"), eachline(IOBuffer(md))) \n\n    if question_index === nothing   # If \"# Question\" not found\n        return (nothing, nothing)\n    end\n    \n    # Find index of the line containing \"# Answer\"\n    answer_index = findfirst(isequal(\"# Answer\"), eachline(IOBuffer(md))) \n\n    if answer_index === nothing   # If \"# Answer\" not found\n        return (nothing, nothing)\n    end\n    \n    # Extract text from the line after \"# Question\" till the line before \"# Answer\"\n    question = strip(split(String(takeuntil(==('# Answer', eachline(IOBuffer(md)))[question_index:])))) \n    \n    # Extract text from the line after \"# Answer\" till the end of md\n    answer = strip(split(String(takeuntil(==('# End Of Markdown', eachline(IOBuffer(md)))[answer_index:])))) \n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nPlease note that this function assumes `# Question` and `# Answer` to be the only lines in their respective sections. If there are other lines after them in those sections then the results may not be as expected. In such case, you might need a more sophisticated parsing algorithm that can handle nested sections and take into account all of the rules of markdown.\n\nThis function also assumes that `# End Of Markdown` is used to indicate end of the markdown part in the text. If there's no such line or if it doesn't appear at the right place, this function would return wrong results. \n\nTherefore, you should ensure your input text adheres to these assumptions for the most accurate result from this function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,450],"elapsed":3.530000641,"_type":"aimessage"}]
