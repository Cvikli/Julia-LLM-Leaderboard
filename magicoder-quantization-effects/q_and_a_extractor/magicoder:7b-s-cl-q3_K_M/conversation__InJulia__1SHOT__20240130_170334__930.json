[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia programming language you can use the `split` function to split the markdown into sections based on section names and then extract the question and answer. Here is a function that does this:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            i = findnext('\\n', line)\n            question = strip(substr(line,i+1)) # substr is equivalent to indexing in Julia\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            i = findnext('\\n', line)\n            answer = strip(substr(line,i+1))\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the input `md` into individual lines and checking each line to see if it starts with either \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If it does, then it extracts the text after that line and strips any leading spaces or newlines. The extracted question and answer are returned as a tuple.\n\nPlease note that in Julia indexing starts from 1 not 0 like Python. `substr(line,i+1)` is equivalent to Python's `line[i+1:]` to get the text after the section name in current line. \n\nAlso remember, this function assumes that each `# Question` or `# Answer` section only appears once in the markdown string and that it is followed by a newline character and then some actual text. If these assumptions are not true, then this function may not work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[0,366],"elapsed":2.821421977,"_type":"aimessage"}]
