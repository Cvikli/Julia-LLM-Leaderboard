[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can write such function `q_and_a_extractor` using Julia's regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nusing REGEX\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    pattern = r\"^(# Question)(.*?)(# Answer)(.*)\"s\n    match = search(pattern, md)\n    \n    if !isnothing(match) \n        question = strip(match[2])\n        answer   = strip(match[4])\n        return (question,answer)\n    else\n        error(\"No matching pattern found\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function first defines the regular expression pattern for the text we are looking to extract. The `^` symbol denotes the start of a line and `# Question` or `# Answer` is what should be present at the start of each section we want to extract. `.*?` matches any character (except for a newline) between zero and unlimited times, as few times as possible, i.e., being non-greedy. \n\nNext we search this pattern in the input `md` using `search` function from REGEX module. If there is a match found it extracts the matched sections (both Question and Answer) and strips them of leading spaces and newlines. Then returns them as a tuple. If no matching pattern is found, it throws an error.","status":200,"tokens":[0,309],"elapsed":2.502248848,"_type":"aimessage"}]
