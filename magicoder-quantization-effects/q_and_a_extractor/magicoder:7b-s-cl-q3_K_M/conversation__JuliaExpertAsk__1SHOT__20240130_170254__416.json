When it finds a line that starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`, it toggles `in_question` or `in_answer` to true, and removes any leading spaces and newline characters from the following text.\n\nWhen it encounters a line starting with `\"### \"` (which is not supposed to be in the question), it assumes that the subsequent lines are the answer, and removes them. \n\nPlease note that this function might fail if there's a `# Question` or `# Answer` inside code blocks (``` ``` ```) without corresponding spaces. It also doesn't handle nested structures (like multiple sections within one \"Question\" or \"Answer\").","status":200,"tokens":[0,372],"elapsed":2.880394302,"_type":"aimessage"}]
