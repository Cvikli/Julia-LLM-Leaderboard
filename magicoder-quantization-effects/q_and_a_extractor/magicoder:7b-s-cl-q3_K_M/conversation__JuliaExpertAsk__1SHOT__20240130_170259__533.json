Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    state = :question\n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\") \n            state = :question\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\") \n            state = :answer\n        elseif state == :question && !isempty(strip(line))\n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif state == :answer && !isempty(strip(line))\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function reads the markdown line by line and based on which section it is in, it appends the current line to either the question or the answer string. Once a line that signals the end of the question or answer section is encountered, the respective strings are stripped of leading spaces and newlines using `strip` function. The function then returns the extracted question and answer as a tuple.\n\nPlease note: This solution assumes that each \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\" mark signifies a separate section in your input string and does not occur inside other text sections.","status":200,"tokens":[0,286],"elapsed":2.228010409,"_type":"aimessage"}]
