[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem using regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    qr = r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n# Answer\"s\n    match = match(qr, md)\n    \n    if match == nothing \n        throw(ArgumentError(\"No # Question or # Answer found in the markdown text\"))\n    end\n\n    question = match.captures[1] |> String |> strip\n    answer = match.captures[2] |> String |> strip\n\n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nIn this code: \n- `r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n# Answer\"` is a regular expression that matches the `# Question` and `# Answer`. `.*?` is a lazy quantifier which matches as few characters as possible. It ensures that everything from `# Question` to `# Answer` is captured. \n- `match(qr, md)` tries to match this regular expression with the given markdown string.\n- If there's no match, it throws an `ArgumentError`.\n- Otherwise, we extract the question and answer using the `captures` field of the match object which gives us all matched substrings as a list of strings. \n- Finally, `strip(::String)` removes leading whitespaces and newlines from the string and returns the processed text.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n    # Question\n    \n        This is my question?\n        \n    # Answer\n\n        Yes, that's my answer!\n\"\"\"\nquestion,answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprint(\"Question: $question\\nAnswer: $answer\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,399],"elapsed":3.087179634,"_type":"aimessage"}]
