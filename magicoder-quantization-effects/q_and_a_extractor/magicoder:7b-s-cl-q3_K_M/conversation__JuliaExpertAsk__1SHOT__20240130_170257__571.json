Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple way of achieving this using Python's `re` module for regular expressions:\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question_match = re.search('# Question(.+?)# Answer', md, re.DOTALL)\n    if question_match is not None:\n        question = question_match.group().replace('# Question', '').strip()\n        \n        answer_match = re.search('Answer:(.+?)$', question, re.MULTILINE|re.DOTALL)\n        if answer_match is not None:\n            answer = answer_match.group(1).strip()\n            return (question,answer)\n    return (\"\",\"\")\n```\nThe `q_and_a_extractor` function will first search the input markdown text for a section labeled \"Question\". If this section is found, it extracts all text from that section. This is done using a regular expression to match the \"# Question\" line and all following lines until \"Answer\" is encountered. This extracted question text is then used to look for the subsequent answer text in the same way.\n\nThis function assumes that the structure of your markdown is as follows:\n```markdown\n# Question\nYour question goes here...\n# Answer\nYour answer goes here...\n```\nIf this structure does not match, you may need to adjust the regular expression used by `q_and_a_extractor` accordingly.\n\nPlease note that you would need to use a different approach if your markdown is formatted differently than shown above.","status":200,"tokens":[0,351],"elapsed":2.71467133,"_type":"aimessage"}]
