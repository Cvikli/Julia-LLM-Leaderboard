If it encounters a line starting with \"# Question\", it sets a flag to indicate that we are now collecting question text. It similarly does this for lines starting with \"# Answer\" and sets a separate flag for this. The current line is pushed into the respective collection array (question or answer) if the appropriate flag is set, and stripped of leading spaces and newlines using `strip()`. At the end, both collections are joined back together into single strings to return.","status":200,"tokens":[0,316],"elapsed":2.45845445,"_type":"aimessage"}]
