[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can define such function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    current = \"\"\n\n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\") \n            current = \"question\"\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\") \n            current = \"answer\"\n        elseif current == \"question\" && !isempty(strip(line))\n            question *= line\n        elseif current == \"answer\" && !isempty(strip(line))\n            answer *= line\n        end\n    end\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nThis function goes through each line in the markdown text and checks if it's a new section by checking for `# Question` or `# Answer`. If it's a new question or answer, it stores the current block of text into `question` or `answer`, respectively. Then, at the end of the loop, it returns the extracted question and answer after stripping leading spaces and newlines.\n  \nPlease note that this is quite naive and might not work perfectly for all possible markdown structures as it's based on simple text matching. If you have more specific requirements or if your markdown documents are too complex to handle, you should consider using a full-featured markdown parser.","status":200,"tokens":[0,321],"elapsed":2.482327598,"_type":"aimessage"}]
