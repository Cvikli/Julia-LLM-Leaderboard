[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The task is to extract specific sections of a Markdown-formatted text by looking for headers (that start with '#'). Julia provides `split(string, delimiter)` function which can be used to split the string into different parts based on the delimiter. In this case, it's `#`. \n\nHere's an implementation:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    sections = split(md, \"# \")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestion = false\n    inAnswer = false\n    for section in sections\n        if startswith(section, \"Question\") \n            inQuestion = true\n        elseif startswith(section, \"Answer\") \n            inAnswer = true\n        end\n        \n        if inQuestion\n            question *= strip(section) * \"\\n\"  \n        elseif inAnswer\n            answer *= strip(section) * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nThis function splits the input string into sections and then loops through each section. If a section starts with \"Question\", it sets `inQuestion` to true and concatenates the section content to `question`. Likewise for the \"Answer\" section, it sets `inAnswer` to true and appends the section content to `answer`. At the end of the function, it returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer.\nThe `strip(section)` function is used to remove any leading spaces or newlines from the extracted text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,337],"elapsed":2.670064106,"_type":"aimessage"}]
