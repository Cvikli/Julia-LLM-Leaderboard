It then returns these two strings as a tuple. The `re.MULTILINE|re.DOTALL` flags are used to make sure that the pattern match spans multiple lines.\n\nThis function assumes that there is at least one line of whitespace following the `# Question` and `# Answer`, which matches your description but might not be the case in actual markdown text. You can adjust the regular expression as necessary if your input is different.","status":200,"tokens":[0,233],"elapsed":1.794839504,"_type":"aimessage"}]
