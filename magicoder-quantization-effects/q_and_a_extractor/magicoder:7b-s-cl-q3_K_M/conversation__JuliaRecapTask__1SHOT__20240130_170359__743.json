[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution using the built-in regular expression module `Regex` of Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    for (i, line) in enumerate(eachline(IOBuffer(md)))\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            # strip leading spaces and newlines\n            question = replace(join([strip(l) for l in line[10:end]]), \"\\n\" => \" \")\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer = join([strip(l) for l in eachline(IOBuffer(md))[i+1:end]], \" \")\n        end\n    end\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nIn the function `q_and_a_extractor`, it reads line by line from the markdown text. When it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\", it saves the following lines as the question (stripping leading spaces and newlines). Similarly, when it encounters a line that starts with \"# Answer\", it saves all subsequent lines until the next section marker as the answer. The function returns these two extracted strings in a tuple.\n\nThis solution assumes that each question is followed by its answer without any intervening text or code blocks. If there can be intervening sections, more complex processing will be required.","status":200,"tokens":[0,318],"elapsed":2.524152275,"_type":"aimessage"}]
