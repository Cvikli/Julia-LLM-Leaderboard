[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this task using the `split` function to divide the markdown into sections and then use regular expressions to extract the content. Here's a possible solution:\n\n```julia\nimport Base.Iterators: peek\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the markdown by section\n    sections = split(md, \"# \") \n\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    for section in sections\n        # If this is a question or an answer, extract the text and remove leading spaces/newlines\n        if startswith(section, \"Question\") || startswith(section, \"Answer\")\n            txt = strip(split(section, '\\n')[2]) \n            \n            if startswith(section, \"Question\") \n                question *= txt   # Concatenate the text for the question \n            elseif startswith(section, \"Answer\")\n                answer *= txt    # Concatenate the text for the answer \n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first splits the markdown into sections based on `# ` and then goes through each section. If a section starts with \"Question\" or \"Answer\", it extracts the text and removes any leading spaces/newlines. It concatenates all of these texts for both the question and answer, and finally returns them as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,317],"elapsed":2.514497388,"_type":"aimessage"}]
