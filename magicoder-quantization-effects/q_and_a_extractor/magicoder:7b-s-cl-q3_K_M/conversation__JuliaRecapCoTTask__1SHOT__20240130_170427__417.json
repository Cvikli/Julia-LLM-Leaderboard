[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

We will also utilize the built-in `split` function in Julia for splitting the sections of the markdown text based on their headers (#). Here is a possible solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')  # Split the string into lines.\n    question = \"\"  # Initialize our answer and question to empty strings.\n    answer = \"\"  #\n    inQuestionSection = false  # Boolean flag that tracks whether we are currently in a Question section.\n    inAnswerSection = false  # Boolean flag for Answer section.\n\n    # Loop through each line of the markdown text.\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestionSection = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inAnswerSection = true\n        elseif inQuestionSection && !startswith(line, \"## \")  # Checks that we are not inside a subsection.\n            question *= strip(line)  # If the line is part of a Question section, add it to our question string.\n        elseif inAnswerSection && !startswith(line, \"## \")  # Same logic as for Question sections.\n            answer *= strip(line)  # If we are in an Answer section and it's not inside a subsection, add it to our answer string.\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)  # Return the extracted question and answer as a tuple.\nend\n```\nThis function loops through each line of the markdown text, checks if we are currently in a Question or Answer section, and adds lines that belong to those sections to our `question` and `answer`. We strip leading newlines and spaces from these strings using the `strip` function. The resulting strings for question and answer are returned as a tuple.\n\nPlease replace {{instructions}} with specific instructions if any.","status":200,"tokens":[0,454],"elapsed":3.6135099,"_type":"aimessage"}]
