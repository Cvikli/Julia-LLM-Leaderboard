The `strip` function is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\nYou can test this function with some markdown formatted text like:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nThis is a question?\n\n# Answer\nThis is an answer!\n\"\"\"\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md)) # Outputs: (\"This is a question?\",\"This is an answer!\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,256],"elapsed":1.977369729,"_type":"aimessage"}]
