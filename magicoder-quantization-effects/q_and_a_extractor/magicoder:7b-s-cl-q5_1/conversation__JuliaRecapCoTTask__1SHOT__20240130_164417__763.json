[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how to solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestion = false\n    inAnswer = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestion = true\n            inAnswer = false\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inQuestion = false\n            inAnswer = true\n        end\n\n        if inQuestion && !isempty(strip(line))\n            question *= strip(line) * \" \"\n        elseif inAnswer && !isempty(strip(line))\n            answer *= strip(line) * \" \"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first splits the input markdown string into an array of lines. Then it checks each line to see whether it is a start marker for either question or answer sections. If so, it starts accumulating the text in that section until the next start marker or end of file. The extracted questions and answers are then returned as a tuple.\n\nThe `startswith` function is used to check if a line starts with a specific string. The `strip` function is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from the lines.\n\nRemember to replace \"{{instructions}}\" in Special Instructions part of your problem statement with actual instructions when you use this code snippet.","status":200,"tokens":[0,343],"elapsed":3.15205642,"_type":"aimessage"}]
