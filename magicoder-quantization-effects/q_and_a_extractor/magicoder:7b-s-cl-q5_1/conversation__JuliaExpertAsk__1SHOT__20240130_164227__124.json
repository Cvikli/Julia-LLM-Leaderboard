It then iterates over each line, checking if it's a question or answer section marker and setting `in_question` and `in_answer` appropriately. For lines that fall within question or answer sections, it concatenates them to their respective strings after stripping leading spaces and newline characters from the end of the line. Finally, it returns the extracted question and answer as a tuple with leading/trailing whitespace removed using the `strip` function.","status":200,"tokens":[128,338],"elapsed":3.06521631,"_type":"aimessage"}]
