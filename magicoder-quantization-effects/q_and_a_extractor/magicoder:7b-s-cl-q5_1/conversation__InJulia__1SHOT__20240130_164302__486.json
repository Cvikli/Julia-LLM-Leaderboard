Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could write such a function using the Documenter package in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Documenter\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n\n    current_section = nothing\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            current_section = :question\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            current_section = :answer\n        elseif current_section == :question\n            question *= strip(line) * \" \"\n        elseif current_section == :answer\n            answer *= strip(line) * \" \"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function goes through each line in the markdown text and checks if it starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If it does, it changes the current section to either :question or :answer. Then, depending on which section you're currently in, it strips any leading spaces from the line and adds it to the question or answer string.\n\nThis function assumes that each question is followed by its corresponding answer (with a \"# Answer\" tag) and doesn't handle cases where there might be more than one question or answer per section. Also, it removes new lines between sections and leading spaces from within each section. \n\nTest this function with an example:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question 1\nThis is the first question. \n    Answer to question 1: Here's a possible answer!\n    \n# Answer 1\nThis should be ignored as it's not part of the first question. \n\n# Question 2\nHere's the second question? \n    Answer 2: This is an incorrect answer, but it's in the right format.\n\"\"\"\n\n@show q_and_a_extractor(md)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,442],"elapsed":3.999519325,"_type":"aimessage"}]
