[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem by using regular expressions to find sections of your markdown that start with `# Question` or `# Answer`. Here is a sample Julia code snippet:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Find all lines that start with `# Question` or `# Answer`\n    question_lines = filter(x -> startswith(x, \"# Question\"), split(md, '\\n')) \n    answer_lines = filter(x -> startswith(x, \"# Answer\"), split(md, '\\n'))\n\n    # Remove leading whitespace and newlines from lines\n    question = mapreduce(x -> strip(x[2:end]), *, question_lines)\n    answer = mapreduce(x -> strip(x[2:end]), *, answer_lines)\n\n    return (question, answer)  # Return a tuple of the question and answer\nend\n```\nThis function takes in a string `md` that is your markdown-formatted text. It splits the text into lines using `split(md, '\\n')`. Then it uses `filter` to find all lines starting with `# Question` or `# Answer`. Finally, it strips leading whitespaces from each line and concatenates them together to form the question and answer strings. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes there is exactly one `# Question` or `# Answer` per markdown file. If your markdown might have multiple sections of either type, you will need a more sophisticated approach, possibly using a full-fledged markdown parser to parse the whole document into its component parts first.","status":200,"tokens":[0,354],"elapsed":3.29684797,"_type":"aimessage"}]
