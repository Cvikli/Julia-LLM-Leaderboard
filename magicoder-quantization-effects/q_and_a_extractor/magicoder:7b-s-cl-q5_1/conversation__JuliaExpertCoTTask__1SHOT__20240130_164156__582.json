When it encounters a line starting with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it sets the corresponding variable to `true` and continues to the next line. For all other lines, it checks whether the corresponding boolean is set to `true`. If so, it appends the stripped line to the question or answer string respectively. Finally, it returns a tuple of the question and answer strings.","status":200,"tokens":[272,282],"elapsed":35.572993278,"_type":"aimessage"}]
