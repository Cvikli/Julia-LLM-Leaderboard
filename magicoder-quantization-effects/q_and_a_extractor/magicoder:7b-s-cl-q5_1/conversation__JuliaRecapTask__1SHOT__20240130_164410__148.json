[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of your problem in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Split markdown by '#' to get sections \n    md_sections = split(md, \"#\")\n    \n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    found_question = false\n    found_answer = false\n\n    for section in md_sections\n        if startswith(strip(section), \"Question\")\n            question = strip(split(section, '\\n')[2]) # take second line after \"# Question\"\n            found_question = true\n        elseif found_question && !found_answer && startswith(strip(section), \"Answer\") \n            answer = strip(split(section, '\\n')[2]) # take second line after \"# Answer\"\n            found_answer = true\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating through each section of the markdown. For each section, it checks if it starts with \"Question\". If so, it assumes that's the question and strips any leading spaces and newlines before storing it as the question. It then checks for the next section that starts with \"Answer\", assuming that to be the answer. Any extra white space at the start of these sections is removed using `strip`. \n\nNote: This code assumes that every \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\" pair will appear in order, i.e., a question won't follow an answer without a new section in between. If such cases can occur, you may need to add some extra logic to handle them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,358],"elapsed":3.330355568,"_type":"aimessage"}]
