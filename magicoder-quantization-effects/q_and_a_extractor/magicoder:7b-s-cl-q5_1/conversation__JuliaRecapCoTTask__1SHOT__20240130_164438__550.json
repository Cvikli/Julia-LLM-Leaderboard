[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a basic approach using regular expressions to extract the question and answer:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)::Tuple{AbstractString, AbstractString}\n    matchQ = match(r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n## Answer\", md; capture=1);\n    question = matchQ == nothing ? \"\" : strip(matchQ.captures[1])\n    \n    matchA = match(r\"# Answer\\n(.*?)\\n## End\", md; capture=1);\n    answer = matchA == nothing ? \"\" : strip(matchA.captures[1])\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function takes a markdown string as input and uses regular expressions to find the sections marked `Question` and `Answer`. The `?` after `.*` makes it non-greedy so that it stops at the first `## End` encountered. \n\nThe `strip` function is used to remove leading white spaces and newline characters from the matched strings. If no matches are found, an empty string is returned for the question or answer. \n\nPlease note that this assumes your markdown has a structure of `# Question`, followed by text, a line break, another line with `## Answer` after which there should be answer text and so on. The function may need to be adjusted if the markdown format varies.","status":200,"tokens":[0,312],"elapsed":2.877654867,"_type":"aimessage"}]
