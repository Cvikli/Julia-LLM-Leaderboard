It then extracts the text between these lines and removes any leading spaces or newlines. If there is no question or answer found in the markdown string, it returns `None`. \n\nPlease note, this solution assumes that a markdown section starts with `# Question` and ends with `# Answer`, which might not always be true as markdown sections could also start/end with other headers (e.g., '### Sub-Question'). If there are multiple questions or answers in the same markdown string, it will extract only the last one.","status":200,"tokens":[0,419],"elapsed":3.798440346,"_type":"aimessage"}]
