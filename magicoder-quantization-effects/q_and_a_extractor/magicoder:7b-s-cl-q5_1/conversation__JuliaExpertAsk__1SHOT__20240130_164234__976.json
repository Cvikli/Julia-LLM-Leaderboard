Then it iterates over each line in the markdown text and checks if the line starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`. Depending on whether these strings are at the beginning of a line, it sets `in_question = true` or `in_answer = true`, respectively, and keeps extracting characters into either question or answer string. The extracted text is then stripped from leading spaces using `strip()` function and returned as a tuple (question, answer).","status":200,"tokens":[0,318],"elapsed":2.859351739,"_type":"aimessage"}]
