[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could implement `extract_julia_code` in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    blocks = split(md, \"```\")\n    \n    # Remove the first and last elements because they are empty after splitting\n    blocks = blocks[2:end-1]\n    \n    julia_blocks = filter(x -> x[1:7] == \"julia:\", blocks)\n    \n    # Remove \"julia:\" from each block and join them together with a newline\n    code = join(map(strip, map(x -> x[8:end], julia_blocks)), \"\\n\")\n    \n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function splits the markdown string into blocks using `split`. It then filters out all the blocks that are not Julia code. Afterwards it removes \"julia:\" from each block and joins them together with a newline. The resulting string is a single piece of Julia code with multiple lines separated by newlines.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there will be no \"```\" in a line of julia code, which would otherwise need to be escaped. \n\nThis implementation may also not work correctly if the markdown file has more than one language specified after \"```\", or if any lines of code contain only spaces. For robust implementation, you may want to use a full-featured Markdown parser such as `ParseMarkdown.jl`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,336],"elapsed":3.839264023,"_type":"aimessage"}]
