[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of the function using Julia's `replace` method, which can replace parts of a string or a regular expression match:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # The pattern matches any code block surrounded by three backticks.\n    pattern = r\"```\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(pattern, md))\n    \n    if isempty(matches)\n        return \"\"  # Return an empty string if there are no matches.\n    end\n    \n    # Join the code blocks with a newline and remove the code fences.\n    code = join([m.captures[1] for m in matches], \"\\n\")\n    cleaned_code = replace(code, \"```\" => \"\")\n    \n    return cleaned_code\nend\n```\nThis function takes as input a markdown document `md` and returns the extracted Julia code blocks joined with newlines. If there are no code blocks in the given markdown string, an empty string is returned. The regular expression pattern used here matches any text between two pairs of backticks (`\\``). The `s` flag at the end of the pattern makes it match the shortest possible string.\n\nThis function assumes that each piece of Julia code block is separated by a newline and does not contain any other types of markdown syntax within it, such as inline code blocks (`` `code` ``), which would also need to be removed if they exist in your input.","status":200,"tokens":[11,336],"elapsed":3.843468163,"_type":"aimessage"}]
