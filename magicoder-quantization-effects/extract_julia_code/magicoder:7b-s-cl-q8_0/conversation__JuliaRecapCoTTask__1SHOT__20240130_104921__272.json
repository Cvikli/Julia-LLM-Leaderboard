[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a basic function that accomplishes this task:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all Julia code blocks in the markdown text\n    julia_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, true)\n\n    # Remove code fences from each block and join with newline\n    combined_code = join([replace(block, r\"^```julia\\n|\\n```$\" => \"\") for block in julia_blocks], \"\\n\")\n\n    return combined_code\nend\n```\nIn this function:\n- `matchall` is a helper function that matches all occurrences of the regex pattern.\n- `replace` is used to remove code fences from each Julia code block.\n- `join` is used to concatenate all Julia blocks into a single string with newline characters between each block.\n\nYou should note that the above function assumes that there are no nested code blocks in your markdown document and that the code blocks do not contain any special characters like backticks (`\\``). If this is not the case, you may need to modify the regular expression patterns or add more logic to handle these cases.\n\nNote: The `matchall` function used here is not a built-in Julia function. If it does not exist in your environment, you should define it as follows: \n```julia\nfunction matchall(pattern::Regex, str::String; startpos=1, count=-1)\n    matches = String[]\n    offset = startpos\n    \n    while true\n        if count == 0\n            break\n        end\n        \n        m = search(pattern, str, pos=offset)\n        if m.match === nothing\n            break\n        else\n            append!(matches, m[1])\n            offset = nextind(str, m.start)\n            count -= 1\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return matches\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,444],"elapsed":5.125615124,"_type":"aimessage"}]
