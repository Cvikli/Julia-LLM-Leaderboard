[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise.

Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem using Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\"\n    matches = re.findall(pattern, md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    code_blocks = []\n    for match in matches:\n        lines = match.strip().split('\\n')\n        \n        # Remove the first line which is ````julia` and last line is ```\n        code_block = '\\n'.join(lines[1:-1])\n        code_blocks.append(code_block)\n    \n    return ' '.join(code_blocks)\n```\n\nIn the function above, we use a regular expression to find all the matches of ```julia code blocks```. The `re.DOTALL` flag allows `.*` to match newline characters as well. For each match, we remove the first line (````julia`) and last line (````), then join the remaining lines with newlines. The extracted code is stored in a list of strings and finally joined into one string separated by spaces.\n\nThis function assumes that the input `md` is a string which includes multiple ```julia code blocks``` and all the matches are continuous. If your document might include other code blocks or mixed languages, you would need to adjust this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,315],"elapsed":3.534851679,"_type":"aimessage"}]
