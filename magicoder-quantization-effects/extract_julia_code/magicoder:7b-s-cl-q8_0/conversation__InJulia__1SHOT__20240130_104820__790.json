[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's a simple implementation of the problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    blocks = [m.captures[1] for m in eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\", md, count=Inf)]\n    \n    if isempty(blocks)\n        return \"\"\n    else\n        # remove code fences (```julia and ```) from the blocks\n        trimmed_blocks = map(strip, blocks)\n        \n        # join the blocks with a newline in between\n        return join(trimmed_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to match all code blocks. `eachmatch` generates an iterator over matches of the pattern in the string. The `.*?` inside the parentheses means \"any character (.) any number of times (*) but as few times as possible (?), i.e., non-greedy\". So this will match everything until the next ```julia\\n.\n\nThe resulting code blocks are trimmed by removing leading and trailing whitespace, then joined together with a newline in between. If there are no matching blocks, an empty string is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,284],"elapsed":3.201754274,"_type":"aimessage"}]
