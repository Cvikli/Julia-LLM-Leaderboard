Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem using regular expressions in Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    pattern = r'```(.*?)```'  # Matches all code blocks between ```\n    matches = re.findall(pattern, md, re.DOTALL)  # Finds all matches and includes newlines\n    return '\\n'.join(matches).strip()\n```\nThis function uses the `re` library in Python which provides support for regular expressions. The `.*?` inside the parentheses is a regular expression that matches any character (.) any number of times (. means any character, ? after it makes the * non-greedy and stops matching when the least amount possible is found). This is why we use re.DOTALL, which makes . match any character including newlines.\n\nPlease note: This function assumes that there's always a newline between different blocks of code. If not, you may need to add a pre-processing step to make sure all the Julia code blocks are separated by new lines. Also, it only removes the outermost fences, if there is any nesting then this won't work correctly and more complex logic would be required.","status":200,"tokens":[0,269],"elapsed":3.013843437,"_type":"aimessage"}]
