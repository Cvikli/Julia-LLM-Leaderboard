[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here's an example of how you might implement such a function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regex\n    code_blocks = collect.(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md))\n\n    # Join the code blocks and remove code fences (```...```)\n    joined_code = join([replace(m.captures[1], r\"^```|\\n```$\" => \"\") for m in code_blocks]...)\n\n    return String(joined_code)\nend\n```\nThis function uses a regular expression to find all matches of the pattern \"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", which corresponds to a fenced julia code block. Each match is then replaced with its second capture group (i.e., the actual code), and the resulting strings are joined together, separated by newlines, into `joined_code`. The `String` function is called on this result to ensure that the return value is a string, rather than a collection of strings.\n\nIf you want to handle potential errors (for example, if no matches were found), you could modify it like so:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regex\n    code_blocks = collect.(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md))\n    \n    if isempty(code_blocks)\n        throw(ErrorException(\"No julia code blocks found\"))\n    end\n    \n    # Join the code blocks and remove code fences (```...```)\n    joined_code = join([replace(m.captures[1], r\"^```|\\n```$\" => \"\") for m in code_blocks]...)\n\n    return String(joined_code)\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,435],"elapsed":5.069312261,"_type":"aimessage"}]
