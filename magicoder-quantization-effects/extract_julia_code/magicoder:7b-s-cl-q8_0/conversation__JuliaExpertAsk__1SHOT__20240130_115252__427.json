Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    code_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md);\n    code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    replace(code, r\"^```julia$\" => \"\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses a regular expression to find all code blocks in the markdown document. The `matchall` function is used to return an array of all matches, which are then joined together with a newline character. Finally, the resulting string has any remaining \"```julia\" and ``` lines removed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,156],"elapsed":1.759441837,"_type":"aimessage"}]
