Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple Python implementation for this problem:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # regex to find julia code blocks\n    pattern = r'```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```'\n    \n    matches = re.findall(pattern, md, re.DOTALL)  # re.DOTALL for making '.' match all characters (including newlines)\n    \n    if len(matches) == 0:\n        return \"\"\n    \n    # joining the code blocks with newline and removing backticks from each line\n    code = \"\\n\".join([match.replace('`', '') for match in matches])\n    \n    return code\n```\nYou can use this function to extract Julia code from a markdown document by passing the document as a string into `extract_julia_code()`. The extracted code will be returned as a single string with each line of code separated by newline characters.\n\nThis function works assuming that all Julia code blocks are properly formatted, i.e., there are no mis-matched fences (like three backticks for opening the block and four for closing it). If such situations may arise in your use case, you would need to handle them appropriately, perhaps by skipping over them or raising an exception.","status":200,"tokens":[0,290],"elapsed":3.271040781,"_type":"aimessage"}]
