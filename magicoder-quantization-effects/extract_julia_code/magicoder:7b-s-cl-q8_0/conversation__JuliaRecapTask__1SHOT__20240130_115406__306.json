[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks and remove code fences\n    blocks = replace.(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md), Ref(\"\\\\1\") => \"\")\n    \n    # Join the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline\n    return join(blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function works by using regular expressions to find all occurrences of Julia code blocks in the markdown document and replacing them with an empty string. The resulting string will contain only the raw code, without any markdown code fencing. It then joins all the remaining code blocks into a single string separated by newline characters.\n\nNote: If there are multiple code blocks that should be executed sequentially, you need to use the `eval` function or `@eval` macro for each block individually as Julia does not support multi-line string literals across different code blocks in the same script.","status":200,"tokens":[0,233],"elapsed":2.670918808,"_type":"aimessage"}]
