[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you might implement `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nimport Markdown\nusing Base64, MIME\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    parsed = Markdown.parse(md)\n\n    codeblocks = String[]\n    for elem in parsed.content\n        if typeof(elem) == Markdown.CodeBlock\n            push!(codeblocks, replace(String(elem), \"`\" => \"\"))\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # If there are multiple blocks, join them with newline\n    if length(codeblocks) > 1\n        return join(codeblocks, \"\\n\")\n    else\n        return codeblocks[1]\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn this function `extract_julia_code`, we first parse the markdown file with `Markdown.parse`. Then we iterate through each element in the parsed content. If an element is of type Markdown.CodeBlock, we extract the code and remove code fences by replacing \"`\" with \"\". We then push this extracted code into a vector named `codeblocks`.\n\nIf there are multiple code blocks, we join them together with newline character \"\\n\" using `join` function. If there is only one block, we return that directly.\n\nThis function assumes that the markdown file contains Julia code in code blocks and no other kinds of code blocks. Note: This solution is assuming that you have the necessary packages (Markdown) installed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,334],"elapsed":3.854883546,"_type":"aimessage"}]
