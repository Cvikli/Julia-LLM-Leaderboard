Then it removes all code fences (and any text before or after the code) from each block using a regular expression and joins them together with two newline characters (`\\n\\n`). \n\nThis solution assumes that there are no more than two code blocks in the markdown document. If there could be multiple blocks, you would need to handle joining them differently.","status":200,"tokens":[0,222],"elapsed":2.502456145,"_type":"aimessage"}]
