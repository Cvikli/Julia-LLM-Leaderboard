Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem using Python's `re` module to perform regular expression matching:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # join the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline\n    joined_code = '\\n'.join(code_blocks)\n    \n    return joined_code\n```\nThis function will find all occurrences of Julia language code blocks in the provided markdown document, remove the fenced code block (```julia...```) and join them together. \n\nPlease note that this assumes the Julia code blocks are properly formatted between pairs of ```julia\\n and \\n``` (where `\\n` represents a newline character). If your markdown documents have different formatting, you'll need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,222],"elapsed":2.493051888,"_type":"aimessage"}]
