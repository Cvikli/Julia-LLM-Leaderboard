[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise. You're precise and answer only when you're confident in the high quality of your answer.","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Question\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is an example of how you can achieve this using Python's `re` module:\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```julia(.+?)```', md, re.DOTALL)  # Extract all Julia language blocks\n    \n    if len(code_blocks) > 1:\n        return \"\\n\".join(code_blocks)  # Join the code blocks with newline\n    else:\n        return code_blocks[0]  # Return the single block as is\n```\nThis function uses a regular expression (`r'```julia(.+?)```') to find all matches of Julia language code blocks in `md`. The `re.DOTALL` flag allows for matching across newlines, which is important when the code blocks span multiple lines. \n\nThe `.+?` in the regular expression means \"match any character (.) one or more times (?)\".\n\nIf there are multiple Julia language blocks, it joins them with a newline (`\"\\n\"`). If there's only one block, it simply returns that block as is.\n  \nRemember that this will not handle syntax errors in the code. Also, this function doesn't perform any kind of preprocessing or validation on the code, so be sure that the input is trustworthy before running this function on it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,316],"elapsed":3.570722662,"_type":"aimessage"}]
