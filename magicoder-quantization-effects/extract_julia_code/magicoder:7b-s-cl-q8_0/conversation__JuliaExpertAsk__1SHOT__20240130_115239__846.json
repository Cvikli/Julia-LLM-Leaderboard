Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code fenced regions and remove them\n    md = replace(md, r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s => \"\", match=true) \n\n    # Find the remaining julia code blocks\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"^ *begin *\\n(.*?)\\n *end\", md, count=false))\n\n    # Concatenate all code blocks and remove leading/trailing whitespace\n    code_blocks = join([strip(m.captures[1]) for m in matches], \"\\n\")\n\n    return code_blocks\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to match the Julia fenced code regions and then removes them from the document. The remaining julia code blocks are collected into an array, stripped of leading/trailing whitespace, and joined together with newline characters. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that you have properly formatted markdown documents with well-formed julia code blocks. If your document has any malformed code blocks or if there are other types of fenced regions (e.g., fenced HTML), you would need to adjust the regular expression used for pattern matching accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,285],"elapsed":3.22203984,"_type":"aimessage"}]
