If a line is an opening or closing code fence (i.e., starts with ` ``` `), it creates a new empty block in our `code_blocks` array. It also ignores any lines that are empty (i.e., just consist of whitespace).\n\nIf we're inside a Julia-specific code block, we append the current line to this block. Once all blocks have been processed, it joins them into one long string separated by newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,389],"elapsed":4.38316327,"_type":"aimessage"}]
