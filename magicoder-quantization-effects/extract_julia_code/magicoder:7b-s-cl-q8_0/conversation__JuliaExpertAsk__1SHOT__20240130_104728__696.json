[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise. You're precise and answer only when you're confident in the high quality of your answer.","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Question\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how this could be implemented in Python using BeautifulSoup:\n\n```python\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(md, 'html.parser')\n    \n    # Find all code blocks\n    code_blocks = soup.find_all('code')\n    \n    # Extract the text in each code block and join them together with a newline\n    joined_julia_code = \"\\n\".join(code.get_text() for code in code_blocks)\n    \n    # Remove any leading or trailing whitespace that might have resulted from joining\n    cleaned_julia_code = joined_julia_code.strip()\n    \n    return cleaned_julia_code\n```\n\nThis function first parses the markdown string as HTML using BeautifulSoup, then finds all code blocks in the parsed HTML. It extracts the text content of each code block and joins them together with a newline. The leading or trailing whitespace that might have resulted from joining is removed by calling `strip()`.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that markdown code blocks are represented as `<code>` tags when rendered as HTML, which is standard for many Markdown parsers including the one used by GitHub (which is what BeautifulSoup is designed to parse). However, if your input differs in some way, you may need a more complex solution.","status":200,"tokens":[0,323],"elapsed":3.628864384,"_type":"aimessage"}]
