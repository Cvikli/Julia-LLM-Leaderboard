Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String) \n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    code_lines = String[]\n    in_block = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_block = true\n            continue\n        elseif in_block && endswith(line, \"```\")\n            in_block = false\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_block\n            push!(code_lines, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    join(code_lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function goes through the markdown document line by line. If it encounters a line that starts with '```julia', it knows that the following lines are part of the Julia code block and adds them to `code_lines`. When it finds a line that ends with '```' (i.e., the end of the block), it stops adding lines to `code_lines` until it encounters another line starting with '```julia'.\n\nFinally, it joins all the code lines into one string separated by newlines and returns this string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,290],"elapsed":3.300396147,"_type":"aimessage"}]
