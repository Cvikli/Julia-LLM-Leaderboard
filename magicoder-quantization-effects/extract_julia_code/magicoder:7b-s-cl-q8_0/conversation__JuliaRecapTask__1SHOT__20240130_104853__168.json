[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

The function uses regular expressions to find the start and end of code blocks, then extracts the code and removes the fences (````julia).\n\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions # for matching\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n((.|\\n)*?)```\", md))\n    \n    if length(matches) == 0\n        return \"\"\n    end\n    \n    code_blocks = map(m -> m.captures[1], matches)\n    joined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    \n    return replace(joined_code, \"`\" => \"\") # remove code fences\nend\n```\n\nThis function should work correctly assuming all the Julia code blocks are well-formed. If there is any chance of malformed or inconsistent code blocks, you might need to add error checking or handle those cases differently. For example, if a block doesn't end with a newline, you could use `replace(block, r\"(?<=\\n)\\z\"` => \"\\n\")` to add one.","status":200,"tokens":[0,269],"elapsed":3.101631729,"_type":"aimessage"}]
