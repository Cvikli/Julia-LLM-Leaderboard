[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can use regular expressions to match code fence patterns in markdown. Here is an example of how you could implement `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Match code fences\n    regex = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(regex, md)) \n    \n    # Join all matched code blocks together with a newline.\n    code_blocks = join([match.captures[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return code_blocks\nend\n```\n\nIn this function:\n- We define a regular expression to find the pattern of `code fence` in markdown documents. The pattern is looking for ```julia followed by a newline(.*?) and another newline```. The s modifier at the end of the regex makes it match the shortest possible string, which allows us to get all the content inside the code block.\n- We use `collect(eachmatch(regex, md))` to find all matches in the markdown document. This gives us a list of Match objects, where each Match object has a field captures that contains the captured strings. \n- Finally, we join all matched code blocks together with newline character \"\\n\" using the `join` function.\n\nNote: This will return all the Julia code in the markdown document as one string without any indentation or formatting. If you want to preserve the original formatting and structure of the code from the markdown, this would need a more complex solution that parses the markdown using an appropriate parser (like Parsers.jl or Gumbo.jl).","status":200,"tokens":[88,378],"elapsed":4.28126141,"_type":"aimessage"}]
