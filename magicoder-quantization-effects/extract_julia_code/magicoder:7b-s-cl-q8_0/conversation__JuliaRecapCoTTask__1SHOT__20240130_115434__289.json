[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"This task requires knowledge of working with markdown files in Julia. The `Markdown` package can be used to parse the markdown document and identify code blocks. Once identified, the code can then be extracted and cleaned up before being combined into a single string. Here is how you could do it:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Parse markdown to HTML\n    html = convert_markdown(md, CodeBlock=identity)\n\n    # Extract code blocks\n    codeblocks = []\n    for block in split(html, \"<pre><code>\")\n        if occursin(\"</code></pre>\", block)\n            push!(codeblocks, block[1:end-20]) # remove ending </code></pre>\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Join code blocks into a single string with newlines\n    return join(codeblocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we first convert the markdown document to HTML using `convert_markdown` from the Markdown package. This converts all of the markdown syntax to their respective HTML equivalents.\n\nWe then split the resulting HTML string by `<pre><code>`, which is how code blocks are structured in HTML. If a block contains this pattern, it means that it's part of a code block. We extract the code within these tags (excluding the `<pre><code>` and `</code></pre>` parts) and add it to our list of codeblocks.\n\nFinally, we join all of the extracted code blocks together with newline characters using `join` and return this string as the result. \n\nPlease note that if you want to preserve the Julia syntax highlighting when embedding the code into HTML or Markdown format, you can use package like \"HtmlTag\" to create `<pre><code class=\"julia\">`. This will then be rendered with correct syntax highlighting in markdown file or other formats. \n\nAlternatively, if your task is just about extracting all the code blocks from a markdown document and you don't care about preserving syntax highlighting or any other formatting within those blocks, this solution should work fine for you.","status":200,"tokens":[0,492],"elapsed":5.647410862,"_type":"aimessage"}]
