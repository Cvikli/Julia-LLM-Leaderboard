[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is the solution for your problem. It uses regular expression to match code fence and extracts the code block:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Find all markdown code blocks\n    regex = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\"ms\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(regex, md))\n    \n    # Join the matched strings without the code fence and newline characters\n    code_blocks = map(m -> m.captures[1], matches)\n    joined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nIn this function, `eachmatch` will go through all the matches of the regular expression in the string. The function `map` is applied to each match object to extract the captured strings (in our case the code blocks). Then join them together with a newline character. \n\nThe regular expression `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\"ms` matches a code block starting with ```julia followed by any number of characters and ending with ``` without matching the newline at the end of the block. The \"m\" flag is for multi-line match, and \"s\" flag enables dot to match newline.","status":200,"tokens":[0,280],"elapsed":3.185702004,"_type":"aimessage"}]
