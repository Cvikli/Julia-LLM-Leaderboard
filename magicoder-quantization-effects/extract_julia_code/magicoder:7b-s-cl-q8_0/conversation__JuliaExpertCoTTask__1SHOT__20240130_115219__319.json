[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown text\n    code_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, captures=true)[1]\n    \n    # Remove code fences from each block of code and join them together\n    joined_code = join([replace(block, \"`\" => \"\") for block in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all occurrences of the code blocks in the markdown text. The `matchall` function returns a tuple where the first element is an array of matching strings and the second one is an array with captured groups if any. We are interested only in the first array (matching strings), so we access it by index 1.\n\nThe regular expression pattern ```r\"```julia(.+?)```` matches a string that starts with ` `` ` and ends with ` `` `, capturing everything inside as a group. The `.` character is any character except newlines, the `+` quantifier means one or more of the previous element, and `?` makes the preceding quantifier \"lazy\", i.e., it will try to match as few characters as possible.\n\nThe function then iterates over each code block, removes the fences by replacing \"`\" with an empty string using replace function, and finally joins all the code blocks together with a newline character.","status":200,"tokens":[0,350],"elapsed":3.980173973,"_type":"aimessage"}]
