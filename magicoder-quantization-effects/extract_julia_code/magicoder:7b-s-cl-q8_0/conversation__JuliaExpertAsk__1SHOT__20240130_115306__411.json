Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```python\nimport markdown\nfrom markdown import Markdown\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    md = markdown.Markdown()\n    blocks = [block for block in md.split_blocks(md) if block.strip().startswith('```')]\n    julia_code = '\\n'.join([block[3:-3].strip() for block in blocks])\n    return julia_code\n```\n\nThis function works by first splitting the markdown document into separate code blocks using the `split_blocks` method. It then checks each block to see if it starts with a triple backticks (```), which is the standard way to start code blocks in markdown. \n\nIf it does, it removes the fences from the beginning and end of the code block (using slice notation `[3:-3]`) and strips any leading or trailing white space before joining them together with newline characters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,206],"elapsed":2.327561298,"_type":"aimessage"}]
