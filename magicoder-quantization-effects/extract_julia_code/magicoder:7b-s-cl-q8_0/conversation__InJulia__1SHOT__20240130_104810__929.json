[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is a simple solution using regular expressions to match the code blocks:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    pattern = r\"```julia(?:\\n|.)*?```\"s\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(pattern, md))\n    \n    codes = String[]\n    for match in matches\n        code = match.match\n        if occursin(r\"\\n\", code)\n            push!(codes, join([m.match for m in eachmatch(r\"(?<=```julia).*?\\n)(.*?)(?=\\n```)\"s, code)], \"\\n\"))\n        else\n            push!(codes, code)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(codes, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function will match all the code blocks in the markdown document with a language type of \"julia\". Then for each matching code block it checks if there are multiple lines or just one line. If multiple lines it joins them together with newlines. Finally, it returns all the code joined by newline characters as a single string. \n\nPlease note that this function will not handle nested code blocks (blocks within another block), nor will it handle multi-line comments correctly because these are not part of standard Markdown syntax. If you need to support these features, please provide more information about the specific requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,315],"elapsed":3.55376255,"_type":"aimessage"}]
