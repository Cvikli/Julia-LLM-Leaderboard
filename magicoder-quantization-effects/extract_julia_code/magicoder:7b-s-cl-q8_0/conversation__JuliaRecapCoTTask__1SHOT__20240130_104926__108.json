[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String.

Note that this assumes that your markdown uses backticks (`\\``) as the delimiter for fenced code blocks and also for inline code.\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\nHere is some code in a markdown file\n```julia\na = 1\nb = 2\nc = a + b\n```\nAnd here is more code that does something else\n```julia\nd = c^2\n```\n\"\"\"\nprintln(extract_julia_code(md))\n```\nThis will print:\n```julia\na = 1\nb = 2\nc = a + b\nd = c^2\n```\nPlease ensure that the `md` passed in is valid markdown syntax.","status":200,"tokens":[0,421],"elapsed":4.865468745,"_type":"aimessage"}]
