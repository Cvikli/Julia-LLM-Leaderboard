[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's how you could do this in Julia using regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regular expression to match code blocks\n    pattern = r\"```julia(.*?)```\"s\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(pattern, md))\n    \n    if isempty(matches) \n        return \"\"  # No code found\n    end\n\n    # Combine and clean the code blocks\n    cleaned_code = join([replace(m[1], r\"`\" => \"\") for m in matches], \"\\n\")\n\n    return cleaned_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first using a regular expression to find all matching blocks of text that look like code blocks, i.e., those surrounded by three backticks (`` ` ``) with \"julia\" after the third set of backticks. The `.*?` part of the pattern means match as few characters as possible (non-greedy) so we get all the code in a single string.\n\nThe `collect(eachmatch(pattern, md))` line collects these matches into an array. If there are no matches, this returns an empty array which is useful for our subsequent logic.\n\nThen, it processes each of these matched blocks by removing any remaining backticks (`` ` ``) and joining them together with newline characters. The final code is then returned as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,320],"elapsed":3.614670644,"_type":"aimessage"}]
