[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is your Python function `extract_julia_code`:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    matches = re.findall(r'```julia(.+?)```', md, re.DOTALL)\n    code = ''.join(matches).replace('```', '')  # remove code fences\n    return code\n```\n\nThis function uses the `re` (regular expressions) module to find all matches of code blocks in your markdown document. The `findall()` method returns a list of all matches, and we join them together with nothing (`''`) to get one long string. \n\nThe `.+?` is used as a non-greedy match which matches the shortest possible string, so it will only include code between the first and last ```` in your code block.\n\nFinally, we use replace method to remove any remaining '```'. The 're.DOTALL' flag allows `.` to match all characters including newline characters.","status":200,"tokens":[254,226],"elapsed":3.78537713,"_type":"aimessage"}]
