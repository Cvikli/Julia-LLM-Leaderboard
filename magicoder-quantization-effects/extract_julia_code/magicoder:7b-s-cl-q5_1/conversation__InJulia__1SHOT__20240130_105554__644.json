It then maps over each matched block, replacing newlines with spaces and joining them all together into one string.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no nested code fences (i.e., ``` inside `...`). If there are any such cases, the result would not be what you expect. This function also doesn't handle multiline code blocks correctly as they might have `\\n\\n` in them which will cause misalignment when joining with spaces.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n```julia\nprintln(\"Hello, World!\")\n```\n\"\"\"\nprintln(extract_julia_code(md))\n# Outputs: println(\"Hello, World!\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,304],"elapsed":2.72634291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
