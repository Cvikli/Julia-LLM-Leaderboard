The `re.findall` method returns a list of strings, where each string is a code block. \n\nThen it joins these code blocks together with newline characters and strips any leading or trailing white space from each line of code. \n\nThe result is returned as a string.\n\nNote: This assumes that the markdown document has been stripped of all other types of markup (like headers, bold text, etc.) before running the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,245],"elapsed":2.198878858,"_type":"aimessage"}]
