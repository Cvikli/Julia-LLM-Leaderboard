[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can extract Julia code from markdown file using Regex:\n\n```julia\nimport Base.replace\nfunction replace(s::String, args...)\n    return string(\"$(args...)\")\nend\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Find all ``` blocks and remove the ```\n    code = split(md, r\"```\" => \"\")\n    \n    # Combine all blocks together with newline\n    return replace(join(code[2:end], \"\\n\"), r\"\\n\\n+\" => \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function starts by splitting the markdown document into two parts: everything before and after the first ``` block. After that, it joins all the blocks together with a newline character in between, effectively removing any code fences (backticks) around the Julia code. The resulting string is then returned. \n\nThe `replace` function is used to remove extra consecutive newlines from the combined Julia code. This is done by replacing sequences of one or more newline characters with a single newline character.","status":200,"tokens":[0,231],"elapsed":2.15507742,"_type":"aimessage"}]
