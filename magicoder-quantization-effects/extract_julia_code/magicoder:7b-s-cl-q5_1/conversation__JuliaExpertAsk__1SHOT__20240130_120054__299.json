Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's how you can do this in Julia using regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nusing REPL.REPLCompletions\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all the Julia code blocks in markdown document\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, re\"\"))\n\n    # Extract and join the code blocks\n    joined_code = reduce((x, y)->string(x)*\"\\n\"*y.captures[1], map(m->String(m), matches))\n    \n    # Remove code fences\n    cleaned_code = replace(joined_code, \"`\" => \"\")\n\n    return cleaned_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first finding all the Julia code blocks in your markdown document using regular expressions (`eachmatch` and `collect`), then it extracts and joins these into a single string (ignoring the ```julia...``` part), removes any remaining code fences with `replace`, and finally returns this cleaned, joined and stripped of fences string.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no nested or escaped code blocks in your markdown document, as handling these edge cases would require a more complex regular expression to correctly handle them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,292],"elapsed":2.620511624,"_type":"aimessage"}]
