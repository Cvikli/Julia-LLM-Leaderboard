[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

It assumes that each code block is delimited by the lines ```julia and ``` which are enclosed between backticks.\n\nThe function then removes these fences from the code and also any newline characters, before joining them together if there's more than one code block found.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\nThis is a markdown document with some julia code blocks. \n\nHere's some code:\n```julia\nx = 10\ny = 20\nz = x + y\n```\nAnd here's another block:\n```julia\nfunction f(x)\n    return x * x\nend\n```\n\"\"\"\nprintln(extract_julia_code(md))\n```\nThis will print out:\n```julia\nx = 10\ny = 20\nz = x + y\nfunction f(x)\n    return x * x\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,449],"elapsed":4.16592646,"_type":"aimessage"}]
