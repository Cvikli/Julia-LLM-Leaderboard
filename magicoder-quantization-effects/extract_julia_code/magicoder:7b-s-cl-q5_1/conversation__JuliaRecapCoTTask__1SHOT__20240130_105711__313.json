[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem, we can use regular expressions to match markdown code fences and extract the Julia code within them. The `replace` function with a callback function that removes the fences will be used to do this.\n\nHere is how you could define such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Matches markdown code blocks, replacing them with their content\n    function match_and_replace(m::RegexMatch)\n        m.match[3:end-3] # Extracts the actual Julia code without fences\n    end\n    # Finds and replaces all matched patterns in md \n    return replace(md, r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s => match_and_replace)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a markdown string as input and returns the same string with all Julia code blocks replaced by their content. The regex `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s` matches any line starting with four backticks, followed by \"julia\", a newline, then anything (.*?) until another newline is found (inside a non-greedy manner), and ending in four backticks. The `=> match_and_replace` argument to the replace function calls our callback function for every match. This function simply returns the match captured by the regex (i.e., the content of the Julia code block).","status":200,"tokens":[0,320],"elapsed":2.974121172,"_type":"aimessage"}]
