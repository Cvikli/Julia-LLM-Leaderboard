[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function that extracts all Julia code blocks from markdown document:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Find all code blocks in the Markdown\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md))\n\n    # Remove the fences from each block and join them together with a newline\n    return join([strip(match[1].captures[1]) for match in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to identify all the Julia code blocks in the Markdown. The `eachmatch` function collects matches into an array, and each match is a `Match` object containing a `Capture` object with the matched text (which we strip using the `strip` function). We join these together with a newline (`\"\\n\"`), resulting in one long string of all code blocks.\n\nIf you want to handle multiple consecutive code blocks, make sure that each block ends with a line break (`\\n`), as indicated in the Markdown specification (https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#code).","status":200,"tokens":[0,260],"elapsed":2.406664472,"_type":"aimessage"}]
