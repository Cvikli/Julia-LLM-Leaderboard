Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all occurrences of code blocks in the markdown document\n    blocks = matchall(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, captures=true)\n    \n    # Remove code fencing from each block and join them together with a newline\n    return join([replace(block[1], r\"^```julia\\n|```$\"; \"\") for block in blocks], \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `matchall` function from the `Text.jl` package to find all occurrences of code blocks in the markdown document. It then removes the code fencing and joins them together with a newline using the `join`, `replace` and list comprehension functions.\n\nThe function works as follows:\n- `matchall(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, captures=true)` matches all occurrences of ```julia...``` blocks in the markdown document and returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two strings - the whole matched block including fencing and captured content.\n- `replace(block[1], r\"^```julia\\n|```$\"; \"\")` removes the code fencing from the captured content of each block by replacing ```julia...``` at start and end of string with nothing (`\"\"`) - this essentially removes these lines from the strings.\n- `join([replace(block[1], r\"^```julia\\n|```$\"; \"\") for block in blocks], \"\\n\")` joins all the stripped code blocks together with newline characters `\\n`.","status":200,"tokens":[118,376],"elapsed":3.484141684,"_type":"aimessage"}]
