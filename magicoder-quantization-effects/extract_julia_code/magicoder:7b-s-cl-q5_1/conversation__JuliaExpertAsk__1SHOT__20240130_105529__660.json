Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of your function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document and store them as strings\n    codes = matchall(\"(?<=```julia\\n)(.*?)(?=\\n```\\n)\", md, capture=false)\n    \n    # If there's only one code block, return it directly\n    if length(codes) == 1\n        return codes[1]\n    end\n\n    # Otherwise, remove the last newline and join all code blocks with a newline in between\n    return join([code[1:end-1] for code in codes], \"\\n\") * \"\\n\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by using regular expressions to match all the Julia code blocks in your markdown document. It uses `matchall` which is a function that finds all matches of a pattern and returns them as an array of strings. The pattern we're looking for is ```julia\\n(.*?)(?=\\n```\\n) which matches any string starting with ```julia, followed by anything (.*?) until it hits a line ending \\n```\\n.\n\nIn the `else` clause, it removes the last newline from each code block and then joins them together with a newline in between. \n\nNote: This function assumes that the markdown document is correctly formatted, i.e., all Julia code blocks are properly delimited by ```julia\\n...```\\n, and it may behave unpredictably if this assumption does not hold true.","status":200,"tokens":[0,354],"elapsed":3.192126209,"_type":"aimessage"}]
