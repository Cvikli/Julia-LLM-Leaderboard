Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you might write such a function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks\n    codeblocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n\n    # Remove the code fences from each block\n    strippedblocks = map(i -> replace(codeblocks[i].captures[1], \"`\" => \"\"), 1:length(codeblocks))\n\n    # Join the stripped blocks with newline\n    joined_str = join(strippedblocks, \"\\n\")\n\n    return joined_str\nend\n```\nIn this function, we are using regular expressions to find all code blocks. The string `md` is searched for occurrences of the pattern `\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n``\"` and captures are used to extract the actual code block content. \n\nThe `replace` function with replacement `\" \"`->\"\"` removes any potential backticks that might be present in the code block. The `map` function is then applied over these blocks to remove all instances of backticks. Finally, we use the `join` function to combine all stripped blocks into a single string separated by newline characters (`\"\\n\"`).","status":200,"tokens":[0,294],"elapsed":2.644441357,"_type":"aimessage"}]
