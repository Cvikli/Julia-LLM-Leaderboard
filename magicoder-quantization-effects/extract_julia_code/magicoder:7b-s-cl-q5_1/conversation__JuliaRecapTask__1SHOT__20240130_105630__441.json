[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

If it encounters a line that starts with ```julia or `, it toggles a flag indicating whether we're currently inside a Julia code block (if the flag is off at this point, it means we just started a new code block). It then checks if we are currently inside a code block and if so, adds each line to our accumulated string of code. The function finally returns the complete string of Julia code.\n  \nYou can test the function with the following:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\nThis is some text... \n```julia\nx = 10 \ny = x^2\n```\nMore text...\n```julia\nz = y * 2\n```\n\"\"\"\nprintln(extract_julia_code(md))\n```\n\nThe output should be:\n```julia\nx = 10\ny = x^2\nz = y * 2\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,486],"elapsed":4.53726698,"_type":"aimessage"}]
