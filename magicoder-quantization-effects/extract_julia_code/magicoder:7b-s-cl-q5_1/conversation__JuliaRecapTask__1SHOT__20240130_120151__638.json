[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how to solve this problem using Python with the markdown library:\n\n```python\nimport markdown\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # Convert Markdown string into HTML\n    html = markdown.markdown(md)\n    \n    # Find all <pre> blocks in HTML\n    pre_blocks = [i for i in html.split('<pre><code>') if '</code></pre>' in i]\n    \n    # Remove code fences from each block and join them together\n    joined_julia_code = '\\n'.join([i.split('</code></pre>')[0].strip() for i in pre_blocks])\n    \n    return joined_julia_code\n```\nThis function works by converting the markdown string into HTML, splitting it up into individual code blocks using `<pre>` tags and then removing the code fences from each block. The blocks are then joined together with newline characters.\n\nYou may need to adjust this function if your Markdown input has additional formatting or structure. For example, it will currently remove all fenced code blocks, not just Julia-specific ones. You might want to add specific handling for that case.","status":200,"tokens":[0,270],"elapsed":2.478577665,"_type":"aimessage"}]
