[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    code_blocks = String[]\n    in_code_block = false\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```\")\n            push!(code_blocks, \"\")\n            in_code_block = !in_code_block\n        elseif in_code_block && !startswith(line, \"`\")\n            code_blocks[end] *= line\n        end\n    end\n    \n    join(code_blocks, '\\n')\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating through each line of the markdown document. When it encounters a line that starts with ``` (which signifies a code block), it adds an empty string to `code_blocks` and toggles `in_code_block`. If a line is not in a code block (`!startswith(line, \"`\")`) and we're currently in a code block (`in_code_block`), it appends the line to the current code block. At the end of each iteration, it checks if there are multiple code blocks, and joins them together with newline characters. The function then returns the joined string.","status":200,"tokens":[388,297],"elapsed":2.783039006,"_type":"aimessage"}]
