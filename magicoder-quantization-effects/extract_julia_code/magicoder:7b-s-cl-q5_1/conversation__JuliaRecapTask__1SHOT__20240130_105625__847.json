[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that accomplishes this:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    code = \"\"\n    in_code_block = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n        elseif in_code_block && endswith(line, \"```\")\n            in_code_block = false\n        elseif in_code_block\n            code *= line[2:end-1] * \"\\n\"  # remove code fences\n        end\n    end\n\n    return strip(code)  # remove leading/trailing whitespace\nend\n```\n\nThis function assumes that the \"code blocks\" in your markdown document are surrounded by lines that start with ```julia and end with ``` (excluding this line), and that these code blocks do not span multiple consecutive non-code lines. If such spanning is possible, you'll need a more complex solution to properly identify individual code blocks.\n\nThis function also does not handle cases where there are multiple code blocks in the same non-consecutive lines (for example, if a block ends on one line and starts again on another). You may wish to add additional logic to handle these cases as well depending upon your requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,305],"elapsed":2.854670012,"_type":"aimessage"}]
