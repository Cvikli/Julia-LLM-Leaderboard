Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function in Julia to solve this problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find the indices of code blocks using regex\n    idx = collect.(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, each=true)).map(m -> (m.start+4, m.stop-1))\n    \n    # Extract the code blocks and join them with newlines\n    result = mapreduce(*, idx; init=\"\") do i, j\n        md[i:j]\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n```\nThis function uses regex to match the pattern of a Julia language code block in markdown. It then extracts the relevant code blocks and joins them together with newline characters using `mapreduce`. The extracted code is returned as a String. \n\nNote: This function assumes that the input markdown document `md` is well-formed, i.e., that each Julia code block is correctly delineated by triple backticks (````julia). If there could be other triple backtick sequences in the text (such as inside inline code spans or between two consecutive code blocks), this function would need to be adapted.","status":200,"tokens":[0,273],"elapsed":2.453214839,"_type":"aimessage"}]
