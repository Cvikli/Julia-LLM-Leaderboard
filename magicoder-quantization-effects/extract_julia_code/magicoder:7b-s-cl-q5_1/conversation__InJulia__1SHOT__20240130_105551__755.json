[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could implement this function in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Split the markdown document into lines\n    md_lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    \n    # Initialize an empty string to store the extracted code\n    extracted_code = \"\"\n\n    in_code_block = false\n\n    for line in md_lines\n        if startswith(line, '`') && endswith(line, '`')\n            in_code_block = !in_code_block  # Toggle the code block state\n        elseif in_code_block && !startswith(line, '`')\n            extracted_code *= line[3:end-1] * \"\\n\"   # Append the line to the code without fences\n        end\n    end\n\n    return extracted_code\nend\n``` \nThis function works by looping through each line of the markdown document. If a line starts and ends with backticks (which indicate a code block in Markdown), it toggles the `in_code_block` state to true or false, respectively. When the `in_code_block` is true and the current line doesn't start with a backtick (meaning it's not another code fence), it appends the line of code without the fences to the extracted code string.\n\nThis function assumes that all code blocks are well-formed, i.e., they start and end with the same number of backticks, and that there is no more than one code block on a given line (if this isn't the case, you might need to adjust the function accordingly).\n\nPlease note that this function will not work correctly if there are multiple code blocks on the same line or other complex markdown structure. For full robust parsing of Markdown files in Julia, you may want to use a dedicated library such as `Markdown.jl`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,430],"elapsed":3.884497443,"_type":"aimessage"}]
