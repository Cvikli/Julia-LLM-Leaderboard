[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia function that solves this problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Regular expression to match code blocks in markdown, it matches ```language\\n...\\n``` pattern.\n    pattern = r\"```([a-zA-Z0-9]+)\\n((?:(?!```).)*)```\"\n    \n    matches = collect(eachmatch(pattern, md))  # collect all matches in an array\n\n    if length(matches) == 0 # if no matches found return empty string\n        return \"\"\n    end\n\n    code_blocks = [m.captures[2] for m in matches]  # get the second capturing group (code block content) from each match\n\n    return join([replace(c, \"\\n\" => \" \") for c in code_blocks], \"\\n\")  # join all code blocks with newline and remove newlines within a code block\nend\n```\nThis function first matches the pattern of a markdown code block. Then it removes the language identifier (julia in this case), as we don't need it for our problem. It then joins all the extracted code blocks together with newline characters, replacing the newline characters inside each individual block with spaces, to get rid of them and preserve line breaks between separate pieces of code. If no code blocks are found, an empty string is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,309],"elapsed":2.803517601,"_type":"aimessage"}]
