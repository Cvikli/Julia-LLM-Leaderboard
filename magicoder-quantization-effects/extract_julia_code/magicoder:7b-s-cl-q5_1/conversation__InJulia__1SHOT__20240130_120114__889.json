[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    blocks = split(md, \"```\")\n    code_blocks = String[]\n    \n    for i in 1:length(blocks)-1:2 # loop over all code blocks\n        block = blocks[i+1]\n        if startswith(block, \"julia\")\n            push!(code_blocks, join(split(block, '\\n')[3:end], \"\\n\"))\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\") # join with a newline and two newlines for each code block\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the input `md` string into an array of strings, where each element is a part of the markdown document. It then loops through this array to find all code blocks that start with `julia`. Each of these blocks is split again and joined together without the first three lines (which include '```' and \"julia\"), which are assumed to be the fences, and then added to a new list. Finally, it joins all elements in this list with newline characters, effectively creating one long string of code from the multiple code blocks found. \n\nPlease note that if there is no 'julia' at the start of the block, or the block has less than three lines, it will not be included in the output.","status":200,"tokens":[0,332],"elapsed":2.974152939,"_type":"aimessage"}]
