Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of `extract_julia_code`:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = split(md, \"```julia\")[2:end]\n    for (i, block) in enumerate(code_blocks)\n        if i < length(code_blocks)\n            code_blocks[i] = chop(split(block, \"```\")[1]) * \"\\n\"\n        else\n            code_blocks[i] = chop(split(block, \"```\")[1])\n        end\n    end\n    return join(code_blocks)\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the markdown document at each instance of ```julia and then at each instance of ``. We then join all code blocks together with newline separations. \n\nPlease note that this code does not account for nested ``` or other special characters in Julia syntax, and it assumes that each ```julia block ends with a ``` on its own line.","status":200,"tokens":[0,238],"elapsed":2.134658109,"_type":"aimessage"}]
