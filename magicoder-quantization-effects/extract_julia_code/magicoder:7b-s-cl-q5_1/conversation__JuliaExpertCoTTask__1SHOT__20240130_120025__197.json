If it encounters a code block that is marked as Julia language (i.e., if it finds a backtick followed by `julia`, and then a newline), it adds the content of this code block to a result string, replacing any remaining backticks with empty strings. It continues doing so until it can't find anymore code blocks.\n\nThis approach is naive: it does not handle cases where the '`' characters are nested inside the code blocks or when there are extra spaces in front of or behind the code blocks. However, for most practical purposes, this should work well.","status":200,"tokens":[0,383],"elapsed":3.489579195,"_type":"aimessage"}]
