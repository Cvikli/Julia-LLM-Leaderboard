[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the function `extract_julia_code`:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Regex to find code blocks in markdown\n    regex = r\"```julia(.+?)```\"s\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(regex, md))\n    \n    # Joining all the code blocks without the fences\n    joined_code = join([match[1] for match in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nThis function works by using a regular expression to find all instances of Julia language code blocks in the markdown document. Each code block is matched and stored separately, and then they are joined together with newline characters. \n\nPlease note that this function does not handle multiline string literals very well, as it treats newline characters inside those strings as the end of a code block. If you need to handle such cases correctly, you would need to modify the regular expression to account for them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,231],"elapsed":2.157060169,"_type":"aimessage"}]
