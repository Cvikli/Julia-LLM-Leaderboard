Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can implement this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    blocks = split(md, \"\\n```\")\n    code_blocks = [split(block, \"\\n\")[2] for block in blocks if length(split(block)) > 1 && startswith(block, \"julia\")]\n    join(code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function splits the markdown string by occurrences of \"\\n```\" to break up code blocks. It then further splits each block into lines and selects only those that are marked as \"julia\" language. Finally, it joins these selected code blocks with newline separators. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the code fence is always indicated by a line ending with ``` and the language is specified right after it. If there might be some other possible formats for indicating code blocks or specifying languages, you would need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,224],"elapsed":2.004751475,"_type":"aimessage"}]
