[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String.

This pattern captures a code block if it starts with ```julia\\n and ends with ``` and includes any number of characters that are not a backtick. Each match is then joined into a single string separated by newlines. \n\nHowever, this function assumes that there is one julia code block per markdown file. If you want to extract multiple code blocks from the same document (for example, nested within different sections), the function needs to be modified accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,275],"elapsed":2.465340848,"_type":"aimessage"}]
