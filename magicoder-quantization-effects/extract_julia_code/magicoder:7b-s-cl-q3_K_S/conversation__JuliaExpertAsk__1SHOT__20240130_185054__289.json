Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regular expression to match the code fences and capture the inner content\n    p = r\"(?s)(?<=\\n)```julia(.*?)\\n```\\n\"\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(p, md))  # Find all matches in the markdown document\n    \n    if isempty(matches)\n        return \"\"  # Return an empty string if no code blocks found\n    end\n    \n    # Concatenate the code blocks\n    joined_code = reduce((x, y) -> x * \"\\n\" * y, matches);\n    return joined_code;\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by using a regular expression to find all the Julia language code blocks in the markdown document. It then concatenates these blocks together with newline characters between each block. If no code blocks are found it returns an empty string.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the input `md` is a valid Markdown document and there's at least one piece of Julia language code in it.","status":200,"tokens":[161,252],"elapsed":3.511012924,"_type":"aimessage"}]
