Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution using the `markdown` and `commonmark` libraries, which can parse Markdown and handle code blocks:\n\n```python\nimport markdown\nfrom commonmark import commonmark\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    ast = markdown.reset().convert(md)\n    return '\\n'.join(commonmark.commonmark(ast).literal)\n    \nprint(extract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\"))\n```\n\nThis function first converts the markdown into an abstract syntax tree (AST), and then retrieves the literal content of each code block. Finally, it joins all the blocks together with a newline.\n\nPlease note that this solution uses Python's `markdown` library to parse Markdown, and `commonmark`'s `commonmark()` function to convert the resulting AST into an actual string. It assumes that there is only one level of indentation for each code block in the markdown. If there are multiple levels of indentation or mixed-level indentation, it might not work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[0,246],"elapsed":1.976706005,"_type":"aimessage"}]
