Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can solve this problem in Python. This uses regular expressions to find the code blocks and remove the surrounding ``` characters:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # pattern to match markdown code fences (ticks)\n    pattern = r'```(.*?)\\n(.*?)\\n```'\n    matches = re.findall(pattern, md, re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE)\n    \n    # join the found blocks with newline and remove trailing newline in each block\n    code_blocks = ['\\n'.join([m[0], m[1].rstrip()]) for m in matches]\n    \n    # join all code blocks together with a new line\n    result = '\\n\\n'.join(code_blocks) + '\\n'\n    \n    return result\n```\n\nIn Julia, you can use the `eachmatch` function from the Base.Iterators module to get all matches of a pattern in a string:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    pattern = r\"```(.*?)\\n(.*?)\\n``\"\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(pattern, md; multiline=true))\n    \n    # join the found blocks with newline and remove trailing newline in each block\n    code_blocks = [join([m[1], m[2].rstrip()], \"\\n\") for m in matches]\n    \n    # join all code blocks together with a new line\n    result = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\") * \"\\n\" \n\n    return result\nend\n```\nYou would use this function like so:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Header\nSome text.\nHere is some code:\n```julia\nfunction hello()\n   println(\"Hello, World!\")\nend\nhello()\n```\n\"\"\"\nprint(extract_julia_code(md))\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,451],"elapsed":3.55753171,"_type":"aimessage"}]
