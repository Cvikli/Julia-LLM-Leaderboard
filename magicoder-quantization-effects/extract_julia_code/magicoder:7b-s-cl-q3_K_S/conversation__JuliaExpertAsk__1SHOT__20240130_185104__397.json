Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use regular expressions to solve this problem in Python. Here is an example function that should work for you:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```(.*?)\\n((?:.|\\n)*?)\\n?```', md, re.DOTALL)\n    if len(code_blocks) > 0:\n        return \"\\n\".join([block[1] for block in code_blocks])\n    else:\n        return \"\"\n```\nThis function first searches the markdown string `md` using a regular expression to find all the code blocks. It then extracts and combines them into a single string. Note that we need to use `re.DOTALL` flag in order to make `.` match any character (including newline), as by default it only matches non-newline characters.\n\nIn this function, if there are no code blocks, an empty string is returned. If there are multiple code blocks, they are combined into a single string with newlines separating them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,242],"elapsed":1.903539916,"_type":"aimessage"}]
