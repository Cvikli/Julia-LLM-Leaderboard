Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an implementation of your desired function in Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # Find all code blocks using regex\n    blocks = re.findall(r'```(.*?)\\n((.*\\n)*)```', md, re.DOTALL) \n\n    # Join the individual blocks into a single string\n    joined_blocks = '\\n'.join([code for _, code in blocks])\n    \n    return joined_blocks\n```\nThe function `extract_julia_code(md)` uses the regular expression `re.findall` to find all matching instances of Julia language code blocks in the provided markdown string (`md`). The argument `(.*?)\\n((.*\\n)*)` is used for capturing the content of each block, and `re.DOTALL` is used to make the `.` match any character (including newline).\n\nThe function then joins these blocks together into a single string using the line breaks (`'\\n'`), and finally returns this joined string as the output.","status":200,"tokens":[0,239],"elapsed":1.897814452,"_type":"aimessage"}]
