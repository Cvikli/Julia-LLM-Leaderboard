[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String.

Below is one possible implementation of `extract_julia_code` function using Julia programming language:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString) \n    # Match all code blocks \n    regex = r\"```(.*?)\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n    \n    matches = collect(eachmatch(regex, md))\n\n    if isempty(matches)\n        return \"\"\n    end\n\n    # Join the matched code blocks together with newline\n    joined_code = join([m.captures[2] for m in matches], \"\\n\")\n\n    return joined_code\nend \n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to match and extract all Julia language blocks from a given markdown document. The pattern `r\"```(.*?)\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s` is used which matches the string between two sets of three backticks (` ``` ``` ). \n\nThe `.*?` in the regex makes it non-greedy, so that the shortest possible match will be found. The matched code blocks are then joined together with newline characters. If no matches were found an empty string is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,277],"elapsed":2.165988589,"_type":"aimessage"}]
