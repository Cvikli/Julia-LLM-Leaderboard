[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise. You're precise and answer only when you're confident in the high quality of your answer.","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Question\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is one way you might solve this problem using Python with its powerful libraries like `re` for regular expressions:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # The pattern matches the beginning of a code block (after a blank line)\n    code_block = re.compile('\\n[ ]*```(.+)\\n(.*?)(?=\\n[ ]*```\\n)', re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE)\n\n    # Extract all code blocks from the markdown\n    blocks = code_block.findall(md)\n\n    if len(blocks) > 0:\n        # Concatenate all the code blocks without the fences\n        joined = '\\n'.join([b[1] for b in blocks])\n        return re.sub(\"^[ ]*\", \"\", joined, flags=re.MULTILINE)\n    else:\n        return \"\"\n```\nPlease note that this function will only work correctly if the markdown document has well-formed code blocks and each block is closed properly. If not, it may fail to extract the correct code or leave extraneous characters in place. \n\nIf you want a robust solution, consider using a full-featured Markdown parser library instead of regular expressions, especially for nested structures like fenced code blocks within indented lines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,300],"elapsed":2.412401132,"_type":"aimessage"}]
