If it encounters a line with code (checked by starting and ending with \"`\"), it removes the fences and adds the code to `current_block`. If it encounters lines of code not part of any block, it starts adding those lines after removing leading spaces to `current_block`. Any other lines are added to `current_block` after removing the leading space. At the end, if there's still some text left in `current_block`, it adds a newline before appending it to avoid two newlines right after another. Finally, it joins all blocks together into one string and returns it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,512],"elapsed":4.097461342,"_type":"aimessage"}]
