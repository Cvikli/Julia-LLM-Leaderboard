If a line starts with ````julia` or ``` it means that this is the start of a code block. The code blocks are then stored in an array. For subsequent lines, if they start with white spaces (or tabs), these are considered as continuation of previous code block. These lines are appended to the last element of the array (`code_blocks[end]`).\n\nAt the end, all the lines of the code blocks are joined together with a newline character (\"\\n\"). The backticks (`) used for marking up code in markdown are removed using replace.","status":200,"tokens":[0,359],"elapsed":6.300057018,"_type":"aimessage"}]
