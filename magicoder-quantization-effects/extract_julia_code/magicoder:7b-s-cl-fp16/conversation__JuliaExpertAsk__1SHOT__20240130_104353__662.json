[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise. You're precise and answer only when you're confident in the high quality of your answer.","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Question\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you might implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all Julia code blocks and extract the content within them\n    julia_blocks = [m.captures[1] for m in eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, flags=re\"\")]\n\n    if isempty(julia_blocks)  # No code blocks found\n        return \"\"\n    elseif length(julia_blocks) == 1  # Only one block\n        return julia_blocks[1]\n    else  # Multiple blocks\n        return join([strip(block, \"`\") for block in julia_blocks], \"\\n\\n\")\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all the Julia code blocks in the input markdown string. It then strips off the backticks (`` ` ``) from each code block and either returns a single joined string if there's only one code block, or joins all the code blocks together with newlines between them otherwise. The function assumes that each code block is correctly delineated by ```julia\\n and \\n``` (newline).\n\nPlease note this function expects that the markdown input `md` follows standard Markdown conventions, particularly regarding how fenced code blocks are formatted. If this isn't the case, you may need to adapt the regular expression used in the `eachmatch` function to better match your specific needs.","status":200,"tokens":[0,342],"elapsed":5.995148482,"_type":"aimessage"}]
