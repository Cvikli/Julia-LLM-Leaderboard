Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is a Python solution using regex:\n\n```python\nimport re\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md: str) -> str:\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```\\n(.*?)\\n```', md, re.DOTALL)  # find all julia code blocks\n    return '\\n'.join([re.sub(r'^```|\\n$', '', block) for block in code_blocks])  # remove ``` and leading/trailing newlines\n```\n\nIn this solution:\n- `re.findall(r'```\\n(.*?)\\n```', md, re.DOTALL)` searches the markdown document `md` for any string between three backticks (```), captures everything between them and stores it in a list, and ignores all newline characters using `re.DOTALL`.\n- `[re.sub(r'^```|\\n$', '', block) for block in code_blocks]` iterates over each element of the list created by `findall`, removes the first three backticks (`^````) and trailing newlines (`\\n$`).\n- Finally, it joins all elements together using newline as a separator.\n\nThe above function will return a string where all the Julia code blocks are combined into one single block of code. If there is no code in `md`, then an empty string is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,318],"elapsed":5.584648891,"_type":"aimessage"}]
