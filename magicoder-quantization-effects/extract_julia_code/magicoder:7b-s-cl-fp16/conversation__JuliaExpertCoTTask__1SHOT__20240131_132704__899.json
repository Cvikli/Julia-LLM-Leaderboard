Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might implement this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    code_blocks = []\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            push!(code_blocks, \"\")\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && isempty(code_blocks)\n            error(\"Found closing code block without opening one.\")\n        end\n        if !isempty(code_blocks)\n            append!(code_blocks[end], line[6:end]) # remove ```julia and newline\n        end\n    end\n    return join([join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")], \"\\n\")  # join all code blocks with a newline\nend\n```\nThis function splits the markdown string into lines. It then goes through each line: if it sees an opening ```julia block, it starts a new code block and adds it to `code_blocks`. If it sees a closing ``` block without having seen any opening blocks, it throws an error. If it's in a code block, it just adds the contents of that line (after removing the initial four characters) to the current code block. Finally, it joins all the code blocks together with newline characters and returns the result as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,302],"elapsed":5.238090884,"_type":"aimessage"}]
