Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution for your problem:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    pattern = r'```julia\\n(.*?)```'\n    matches = re.findall(pattern, md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # join the matches with newline and remove code fences\n    julia_code = '\\n'.join([match[2:] for match in matches]) \n    \n    return julia_code\n```\n\nThe function `extract_julia_code` uses a regular expression to find all Julia language blocks. The pattern `r'```julia\\n(.*?)```` captures the content between the triple backticks with `julia`. The `re.DOTALL` flag is used to make the `.*` non-greedy and include newlines in the match.\n\nAfter that, we join all the matches together with a newline character `\\n`, and remove the code fences (`match[2:]`). \n\nIf you want to use it for Python, you can install `regex` module via pip by using the following command - `pip install regex`.\n```python\nimport regex as re\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,270],"elapsed":4.744156307,"_type":"aimessage"}]
