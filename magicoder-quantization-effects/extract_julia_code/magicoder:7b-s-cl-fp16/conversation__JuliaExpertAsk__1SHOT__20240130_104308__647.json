Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here is a possible implementation of your problem using Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    matches = re.findall(r'```(.*?)```', md, re.DOTALL) \n\n    # Join them together with newline separator\n    code = \"\\n\".join([match for match in matches])\n    \n    return code\n```\nThis function will search for all occurrences of three backticks ( ``` ) within the markdown document `md`. The `.*?` inside the first set of backticks is a regular expression that indicates any characters until it encounters another set of three backticks. The `re.DOTALL` flag means \"make . match all characters, not just newline\".\n\nPlease note that Python's `re` module uses different syntax than Julia. If you are looking for a solution in Julia, the function would be slightly different. Also, the exact requirements of your markdown document might require more sophisticated parsing and handling than this basic approach provides.","status":200,"tokens":[118,247],"elapsed":4.326962831,"_type":"aimessage"}]
