Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regex\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    if isempty(matches)\n        return \"\"  # Return empty string if no code blocks found\n    end\n\n    # Join all matched code blocks together with a newline\n    code_blocks = join([match.captures[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Remove code fences from the code blocks\n    cleaned_code = replace.(code_blocks, r\"^```julia\\n|```$\" => \"\")\n    \n    return join(cleaned_code, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by using regular expressions to match all occurrences of code blocks in the markdown document. It then joins these matched code blocks together with a newline character and removes any remaining code fences from the resulting string. If no code blocks are found, it returns an empty string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,263],"elapsed":4.557737977,"_type":"aimessage"}]
