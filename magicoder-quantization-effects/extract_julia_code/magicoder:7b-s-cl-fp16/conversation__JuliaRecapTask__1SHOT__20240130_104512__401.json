[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is one way to solve this task using Regex in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Find all code blocks using regex\n    blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, seperators=true))\n\n    code = \"\"\n    for block in blocks\n        # Remove the fence from each block\n        code_block = replace(block.captures[1], \"`\" => \"\")\n        \n        # Add a newline if there is already some code in the result, and add this code block to the result\n        if !isempty(code)\n            code *= \"\\n\"\n        end\n        code *= code_block\n    end\n\n    return string(code)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by finding all of the Julia code blocks in the markdown document and then removing the fences from each block. If there are multiple code blocks, it joins them together with a newline character between each one. \n\nPlease note that this function is not perfect, particularly when the markdown includes escaped backticks (`\\``) within the code blocks or when the markdown contains other types of fenced code blocks (e.g., Python). However, for most typical use cases it should work fine.","status":200,"tokens":[0,289],"elapsed":5.118887543,"_type":"aimessage"}]
