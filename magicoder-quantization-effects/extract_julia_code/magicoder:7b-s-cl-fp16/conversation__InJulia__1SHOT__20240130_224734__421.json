It then removes the code fences and joins them together with a newline. The `reduce` function is used to concatenate all the code blocks into one string. \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that there are no nested or mixed code blocks (e.g., an HTML block within a Julia block). If your input can have such cases, you would need a more complex solution.","status":200,"tokens":[0,241],"elapsed":4.158458591,"_type":"aimessage"}]
