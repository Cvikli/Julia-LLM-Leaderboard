[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function in Julia to solve this problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regex\n    codeblocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    # If there are no code blocks, return an empty string\n    if isempty(codeblocks)\n        return \"\"\n    end\n\n    # Concatenate all the code blocks together with a newline in between\n    combined_code = join([match.captures[1] for match in codeblocks], \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Remove any leading or trailing whitespace and newlines\n    cleaned_code = replace(combined_code, r\"^[\\t\\s]*\\n*|\\n[\\t\\s]*$\" => \"\")\n    \n    return cleaned_code\nend\n```\nThis function works by using regular expressions to find all code blocks in the markdown document. It then concatenates these blocks together with a newline character between each block, and removes any leading or trailing whitespace or newlines from the resulting string. If there are no code blocks in the document, it returns an empty string.","status":200,"tokens":[388,274],"elapsed":4.817995073,"_type":"aimessage"}]
