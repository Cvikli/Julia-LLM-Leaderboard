[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can write this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all the julia code blocks\n    blocks = matchall(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, capture=2)\n    \n    # Remove the fences and join the blocks together with a newline\n    return join([replace(block, r\"```\" => \"\") for block in blocks], \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to match all of the Julia code blocks in `md`. The function then removes the fences from each block using the replace function and joins them together into a single string with newline characters. \n\nNote: This function assumes that the markdown document is well-formed, meaning that every opening code fence has a corresponding closing fence. If there are any malformed code blocks in `md`, this solution might not work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[254,209],"elapsed":15.043379476,"_type":"aimessage"}]
