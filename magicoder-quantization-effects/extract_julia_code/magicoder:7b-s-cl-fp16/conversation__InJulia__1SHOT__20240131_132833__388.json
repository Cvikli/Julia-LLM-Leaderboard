It then joins these together with a newline in between, and removes any backticks (which are used for markdown syntax). The `strip` function is used to remove leading or trailing newlines from the joined code.\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes that each julia code block starts with ```julia\\n and ends with \\n````. If your markdown document uses different syntax, you would need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,261],"elapsed":4.50324654,"_type":"aimessage"}]
