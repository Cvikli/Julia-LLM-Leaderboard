[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

We then join all of these code blocks together with a newline character and remove the surrounding fences (if any). \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no nested code fences in your markdown document, as this solution wouldn't work correctly for those situations. If you do have nested fences, you would need to adjust the function accordingly.\n\nYou can call the `extract_julia_code` function with a string of your markdown document:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# This is some Markdown document\nHere is a code block:\n```julia\nx = 10\ny = 20\n```\nAnd here's another one:\n```\nz = x + y\n```\nThis should become a single string of all the Julia code in the markdown document.\n\"\"\"\nprintln(extract_julia_code(md))\n```\nThe output would be:\n```julia\nx = 10\ny = 20\nz = x + y\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,435],"elapsed":7.733088839,"_type":"aimessage"}]
