[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can solve this problem using regular expressions in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regular expression pattern to match code blocks\n    p = r\"```julia.*?\\n(.*?)```\"s\n    \n    # Find all matching groups\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(p, md))\n    \n    # Join the matched strings with newline and remove backticks (code fences)\n    code_blocks = join([replace(m.captures[1], \"`\" => \"\") for m in matches], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return code_blocks\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to match all the julia language code blocks in the markdown document. The `p` pattern matches a string that starts with three backticks (```), followed by \"julia\", and then any number of characters until it reaches another set of three backticks (```). The `.*?` after \"julia\" is a non-greedy match, meaning it will stop at the first ``` instead of going all the way to the last one.\n\nThe `eachmatch(p, md)` function applies the pattern `p` to the markdown string `md`. It returns an iterator that produces Match objects for each matching subsequence in `md`. \n\n`collect(eachmatch(p, md))` converts this iterator into a vector of Match objects.\n\nThe `join([replace(m.captures[1], \"`\" => \"\") for m in matches], \"\\n\")` function concatenates all the matched strings with newline characters between them and removes the backticks from the start and end of each code block. \n\nFinally, the joined string is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,390],"elapsed":6.825855468,"_type":"aimessage"}]
