[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is an example of how you can write such a function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nimport README_checks: extract_code_blocks, remove_code_fences\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = extract_code_blocks(md)\n    cleaned_blocks = map(remove_code_fences, code_blocks)\n    joined_code = join(cleaned_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, `extract_code_blocks` and `remove_code_fences` are assumed to be functions that extract the code blocks from the markdown document and remove the code fences respectively. These two functions would need to be defined elsewhere in your codebase or imported from an external package.\n\nPlease note that this is a high-level solution and might require further customization based on the exact requirements of your task, including how the provided instructions should influence the function's behavior.","status":200,"tokens":[0,230],"elapsed":4.017881702,"_type":"aimessage"}]
