Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution using BeautifulSoup to parse the markdown document:\n\n```python\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(md, 'html.parser')\n    code_blocks = soup.find_all('code', class_='language-julia')\n    \n    if not code_blocks:\n        return \"\"\n    \n    julia_code = \"\\n\".join([re.sub(r'```\\n|```', '', block.string) for block in code_blocks])\n    return julia_code\n```\n\nThis function will find all `code` blocks with the class 'language-julia' and remove any newline characters (`\\n`) that may be present at the start or end of each code block. It then joins these code blocks together into a single string separated by newlines. If no julia code blocks are found, it returns an empty string.\n\nPlease note that you need to have `beautifulsoup4` and `lxml` installed in your Python environment. You can install them using pip:\n```bash\npip install beautifulsoup4 lxml\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,271],"elapsed":4.679331501,"_type":"aimessage"}]
