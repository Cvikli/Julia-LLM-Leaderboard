Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    code_blocks = findall(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seperators=true)\n    \n    # Remove code fences from each block and join them with a newline\n    joined_code = join([replace(block[1], \"\\n\" => \"\") for block in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return String(joined_code)\nend\n```\nThis function works by using regular expressions to find all the code blocks in the markdown document, then removing the fences from each block and joining them with a newline. The resulting string will contain all of the Julia code found in the markdown document with the code fences removed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,195],"elapsed":3.365048026,"_type":"aimessage"}]
