[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is an example of how you can implement `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nimport Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Parse markdown string into document and block elements.\n    doc = parse_raw(Markdown, md)\n\n    codeblocks = String[]\n    for element in doc.content\n        if isa(element, Markdown.Paragraph) && isa(first(element.content), Markdown.Code)\n            push!(codeblocks, join([strip(x.language) * \"\\n\" * strip(x.code) \n                    for x in first(element.content).content]))\n        end\n    end\n\n    return join(codeblocks, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `Markdown` package which can be installed via `Pkg.add(\"Markdown\")` if it isn't already included in your environment. \n\nThe function works by iterating over all elements of the parsed markdown document. If an element is a paragraph and the first content element of that paragraph is also a code block, then this code block gets joined with its language specification at the beginning (if present) and added to the `codeblocks` array. Finally, these blocks are joined into one string separated by two newlines (`\\n\\n`). \n\nThe function will work regardless of whether there's only one julia code block or multiple ones.","status":200,"tokens":[0,332],"elapsed":5.839708977,"_type":"aimessage"}]
