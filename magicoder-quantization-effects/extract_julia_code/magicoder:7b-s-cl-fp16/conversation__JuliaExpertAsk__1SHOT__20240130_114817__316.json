Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple solution in Python using regex:\n```python\nimport re\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    pattern = r'```(.*?)```'\n    return re.sub(pattern, '', md).strip()\n```\nThis function `extract_julia_code` uses the regular expression to find all code blocks between ``` and ``` in the markdown document. The `.*?` is a non-greedy match of any character (except for newline) and `?` makes it stop at the closest possible location. After that, we remove those matched blocks from the original markdown string with `re.sub`. Finally, we use `strip()` to remove extra white spaces on both sides.\n\nPlease note this is a very basic solution. It assumes that all code blocks are properly formatted and correctly used three backticks (```) for fencing. It does not take care of cases where the code block might be indented or has other special characters.\n\nFor more complex cases, you may need to use a more sophisticated parsing method, possibly with libraries like BeautifulSoup in Python or equivalent ones in Julia itself.","status":200,"tokens":[0,249],"elapsed":4.365921915,"_type":"aimessage"}]
