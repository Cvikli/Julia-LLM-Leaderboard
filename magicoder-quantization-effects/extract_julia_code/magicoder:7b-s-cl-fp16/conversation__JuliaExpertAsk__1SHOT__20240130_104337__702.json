Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use regular expressions to find code blocks in your markdown document. Here's a simple function `extract_julia_code` that does this:\n\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code fences (marked by ```) in the markdown document\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```(.*?)```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    if isempty(matches) \n        return \"\"\n    end\n\n    # Concatenate the matched code blocks and remove the triple backticks\n    code_blocks = join([match.captures[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\n    code_blocks = replace(code_blocks, \"```\" => \"\")\n    \n    return code_blocks\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `eachmatch` function from the RegularExpressions module to find all occurrences of a code block enclosed in triple backticks (```...```). It then concatenates these matched code blocks into one string, removing any remaining triple backticks. If there are no matches (i.e., if there are no code blocks in your markdown document), the function returns an empty string.\n\nRemember to import `RegularExpressions` module before using it. You can do this by adding following line to your script:\n\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,326],"elapsed":5.705953894,"_type":"aimessage"}]
