The captures are then joined together using a newline character.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that each code block has exactly one line, and it does not handle cases where the code blocks might span multiple lines. You would need to adapt it to fit your exact use case if that's the case.","status":200,"tokens":[0,243],"elapsed":4.253665819,"_type":"aimessage"}]
