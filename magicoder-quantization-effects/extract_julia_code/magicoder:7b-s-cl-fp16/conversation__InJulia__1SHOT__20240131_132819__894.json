[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can implement this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regex\n    blocks = [match.offset for match in eachmatch(r\"```julia.*?\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, count=0)]\n    \n    if isempty(blocks)\n        return \"\"\n    end\n\n    # Extract and join the code blocks\n    joined_code = reduce((a, b)-> a * \"\\n\" * b, [md[block+6:end-3] for block in blocks])\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nThis function first finds all matches of code blocks using regex. Then it extracts and joins the matched parts together with newline characters. It also checks if there are no code blocks found, then returns an empty string. \n\nPlease note that this is a simple implementation and might not cover all edge cases. For example, it assumes that every code block ends with three backticks (```), which may not be the case in some more complex markdown documents. You would need to adjust the regular expression accordingly if you want to handle those cases as well.","status":200,"tokens":[0,268],"elapsed":4.619603684,"_type":"aimessage"}]
