It then removes the code fences from each match and joins them together with a newline. If no code blocks are found, it returns an empty string. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is only one level of indentation for the code inside the fence, as indicated by the first line of your problem statement. If there can be multiple levels of indentation, you may need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,292],"elapsed":5.043778378,"_type":"aimessage"}]
