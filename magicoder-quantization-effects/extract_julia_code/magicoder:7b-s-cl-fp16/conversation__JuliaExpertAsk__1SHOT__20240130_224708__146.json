Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of your request in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regex\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    # Extract the code from each match and join them together with a newline\n    code_blocks = mapreduce(m -> m.captures[1], vcat, matches)\n    \n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all occurrences of the Julia language code blocks in your markdown document and extracts the actual code from them. It then joins these extracted codes together with a newline character. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is exactly one line break after each ```julia\\n, which may not be true for all markdown documents. If you have different formatting in your markdown document, you might need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,232],"elapsed":4.006865118,"_type":"aimessage"}]
