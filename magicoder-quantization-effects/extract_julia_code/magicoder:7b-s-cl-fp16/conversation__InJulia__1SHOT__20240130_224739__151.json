This function uses regular expressions to find the Julia code blocks in the markdown document. It then removes the code fences and joins all the code together with a newline character.\n\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regular expression pattern for Julia code block\n    pattern = r\"```julia(.+?)```\"s\n    \n    matches = collect(eachmatch(pattern, md))\n    if isempty(matches)\n        return \"\"\n    end\n\n    # Remove the code fences and join all the code together with a newline character\n    code_blocks = map(m -> match(r\"(.+?)\\n\", m.captures[1]).captures[1], matches)\n    joined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nThis function assumes that the markdown document `md` is a string and it contains one or more Julia code blocks. If there are no matches found, an empty string will be returned. \n\nPlease note that this implementation uses the `RegularExpressions` package in Julia which provides support for regular expressions. Make sure to add this package to your project before using this function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,298],"elapsed":5.148559056,"_type":"aimessage"}]
