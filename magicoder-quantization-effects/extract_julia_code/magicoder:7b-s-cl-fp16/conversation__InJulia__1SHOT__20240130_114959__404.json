It then strips any whitespace from the beginning or end of each code block before joining them together into one string. Note that this approach assumes that the code fences are correctly formatted as \"````julia\\n\" at the start, and \"\\n```\" at the end.","status":200,"tokens":[0,250],"elapsed":4.370564961,"_type":"aimessage"}]
