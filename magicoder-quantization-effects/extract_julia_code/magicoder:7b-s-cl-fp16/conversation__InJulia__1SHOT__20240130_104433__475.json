The `eachmatch` function will iterate over the matches in the document. We then collect these into an array and join them together with newline characters. \n\nWe remove the surrounding backticks from each line of code using the `replace` and `split` functions. Finally, we join all of the stripped code blocks back together again.","status":200,"tokens":[0,273],"elapsed":4.754852337,"_type":"aimessage"}]
