The `split` function splits the input string into parts based on `````, and `[p[2:end] for p in x if length(p)>2]` removes the code fences. Finally, `join(sep=\"\\n\", join=true)` joins all the code blocks together with newline characters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,261],"elapsed":4.584975868,"_type":"aimessage"}]
