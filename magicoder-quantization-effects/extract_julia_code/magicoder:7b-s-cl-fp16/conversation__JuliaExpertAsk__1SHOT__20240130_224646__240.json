Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can write this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regular expression\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    code_blocks = join([match.captures[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return code_blocks\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all code blocks in the markdown document. It then joins these code blocks together with a newline character, effectively removing any code fences (the three backticks surrounding the code block). The `collect(eachmatch(...))` part of the function is used to collect the matches into an array.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no nested code blocks in your markdown document. If there could be nested code blocks, you would need a more complex solution that can handle those cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,235],"elapsed":4.059540235,"_type":"aimessage"}]
