The `re.DOTALL` flag allows the dot in the pattern to match any character, including newline.\n\nThe `findall()` method returns a list of all matches, and each match is a string that includes the code fences. We then remove the code fences by slicing the string from index 1 (which is after the opening code fence) to the end.\n\nFinally, we join all the code blocks together with newline characters using the `join()` method and return the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,259],"elapsed":4.487001281,"_type":"aimessage"}]
