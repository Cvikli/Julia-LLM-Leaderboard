[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could write this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    code_blocks = split(md, \"```julia\\n\")[2:end]  # Split the markdown string into an array by the ```julia block.\n    code_blocks = map((x)->split(x,\"\\n```\")[1],code_blocks)  # Get rid of the ``` at the end of each block.\n    joined_code = join([code for code in code_blocks], \"\\n\")   # Combine all code blocks into one string, with newline between each.\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the markdown string into an array at every occurrence of ```julia and then removing the trailing newline. It also removes the closing fences ` from each block. Finally it combines all blocks together into one large string with a newline between each.","status":200,"tokens":[0,220],"elapsed":3.912726582,"_type":"aimessage"}]
