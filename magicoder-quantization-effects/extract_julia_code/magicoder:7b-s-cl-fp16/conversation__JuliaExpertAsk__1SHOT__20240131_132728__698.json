Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Python solution for your problem:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```julia(.+?)```', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # Join the blocks together with a newline and remove code fences:\n    return '\\n'.join([re.sub('^```julia\\n|\\n```$', '', block) for block in code_blocks])\n```\nThe function `extract_julia_code` uses regular expressions to find all the Julia language code blocks in the provided markdown document (`md`). The `re.DOTALL` flag is used to make `.+?` match any character (except newline) between the fences, including newlines.\n\nAfter that, it joins the blocks together with a newline and removes code fences from each block using another regular expression. This function then returns a string containing all the Julia language code blocks joined by newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,227],"elapsed":3.91614109,"_type":"aimessage"}]
