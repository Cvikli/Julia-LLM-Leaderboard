[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of the function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # find all code blocks using regex\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1)) \n    \n    if isempty(matches) \n        return \"\" \n    end\n    \n    # remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    code_blocks = join([match[2] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return code_blocks\nend\n```\nThis function works by using regular expressions to find all occurrences of Julia code blocks in the markdown document. It then concatenates these blocks together, removing any code fencing (the ``` and \\n lines surrounding them). If no matches are found, it returns an empty string. Otherwise, it joins the matched strings with a newline character between each match.\n\nNote: This function assumes that all code blocks in the markdown document use the syntax ````julia\\n(code block)\\n```. If your markdown documents use different conventions for code fencing or if they do not include the language identifier \"julia\", you would need to adjust this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,283],"elapsed":4.883235252,"_type":"aimessage"}]
