Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Python solution:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # find all code blocks using regex\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```(\\w+)\\n(.*?)```', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # join the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline\n    code = \"\\n\".join([code for _, code in code_blocks])\n    \n    return code\n```\n\nThe function `extract_julia_code` uses python's built-in `re` module to find all the Julia language code blocks using regex. The regex pattern used here is `r'```(\\w+)\\n(.*?)```' which matches any text between three backticks ( ``` ) and captures the first word after them as the language identifier, and captures everything until the next set of three backticks. The `re.DOTALL` flag allows dot to match newline characters too.\n\nFinally, we join all the code blocks together with a newline character (`\\n`) using list comprehension and string concatenation (`+`).\n\nThis function assumes that there is only one Julia code block in each markdown document. If there can be multiple code blocks and you want to merge them into one string, you might need to adjust this function accordingly or provide more details about how exactly the blocks should be merged.","status":200,"tokens":[0,314],"elapsed":5.515176574,"_type":"aimessage"}]
