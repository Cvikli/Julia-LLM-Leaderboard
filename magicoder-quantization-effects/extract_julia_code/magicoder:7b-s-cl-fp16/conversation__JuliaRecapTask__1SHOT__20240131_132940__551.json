[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function written in Julia that can extract all the Julia code from markdown document:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    code_blocks = []\n    in_code_block = false\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```\")\n            in_code_block = !in_code_block\n            continue\n        end\n        if in_code_block && endswith(line, \"```\")\n            code_blocks = push!(code_blocks, line[1:end-3])\n        elseif in_code_block\n            code_blocks = push!(code_blocks, line)\n        end\n    end\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function splits the markdown document into lines and checks each one. If it's a line that starts or ends with ``` (which is used to denote code blocks in markdown), it toggles `in_code_block` status and continues if it's not needed. Otherwise, if it's inside a code block, it extracts the content between ``` marks and adds it into `code_blocks`. After going through all lines, it joins all the code blocks together with newline characters and returns them as a single string.\n\nThe function does not handle cases where there are multiple consecutive code blocks or nested code blocks. If you want to support those cases, you would need to adjust the function accordingly. \n\nThis function assumes that there is exactly one set of triple backticks (`````) per block, and doesn't consider any language specification (like `julia` in ```julia).","status":200,"tokens":[0,385],"elapsed":6.7399533,"_type":"aimessage"}]
