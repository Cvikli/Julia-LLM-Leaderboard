Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    pattern = r'```julia\\n(.*?)```'\n    matches = re.findall(pattern, md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # join all code blocks into a single string with newline\n    code = '\\n'.join(matches)\n    \n    return code\n```\nThis function uses the `re` module to find all occurrences of Julia code blocks in the markdown document. The `findall` method returns a list of all matches, and the `DOTALL` flag makes `.` match any character including newline. Then it joins these matches into a single string with newline characters between each match.\n\nThis function assumes that the input is a string representing the markdown document. If the input can be in other formats (like file or stream), you would need to adjust this accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,213],"elapsed":3.673959679,"_type":"aimessage"}]
