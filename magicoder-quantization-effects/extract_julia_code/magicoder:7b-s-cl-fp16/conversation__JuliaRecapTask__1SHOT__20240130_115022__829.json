[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To extract all Julia code from markdown files, we can use the `Markdown.parse` function which returns an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree). The `CodeBlock` type in this tree corresponds to code blocks and it has a field called `literal` that contains the actual content of these blocks. Therefore, we will iterate over all elements of the markdown document's AST, check if each element is of type `CodeBlock`, retrieve its literal, remove any leading/trailing fences (if present), join them together with a newline and finally return this combined code string.\n\nHere is the Julia function for your problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    ast = parse(md)  # Parse markdown to AST\n    code_blocks = filter!(x -> typeof(x) == Markdown.CodeBlock, ast)\n    \n    if isempty(code_blocks)\n        return \"\"  # No code blocks found\n    end\n\n    code_strings = String[]\n    for block in code_blocks\n        literal = strip(block.literal, '`')  # Remove fences and leading/trailing spaces\n        \n        # Julia syntax highlighting: remove `<script>` tags if present\n        if startswith(literal, \"<script>\") && endswith(literal, \"</script>\")\n            literal = split(literal, '<')[3]  # Extract the actual code\n        end\n\n        push!(code_strings, literal)\n    end\n    \n    return join(code_strings, '\\n')\nend\n```\nThis function works by first parsing the markdown document into an Abstract Syntax Tree. It then filters out all elements that are not of type `CodeBlock`. For each code block, it retrieves its literal, removes leading and trailing fences (if present), joins them together with a newline and finally returns this combined string.\nIf there are no code blocks in the markdown document, the function will return an empty string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,453],"elapsed":8.1211113,"_type":"aimessage"}]
