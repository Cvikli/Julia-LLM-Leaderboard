Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of your request in Julia using regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks and remove the fences\n    code_blocks = replace.(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md), r\"^`|$\\n\" => \"\")\n    \n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all code blocks in your markdown document. The `eachmatch` function returns an array of matches for the pattern in the string. We then use `replace.(...)` with a regular expression that removes the fences (`^` and `$`) from each match, effectively extracting the Julia code within them.\n\nThe resulting array of code blocks is joined together into a single string with newline characters between each block using the `join` function. This function takes an array and a separator (in this case, a newline character), and returns a new string where all elements in the array have been joined by the separator.","status":200,"tokens":[0,262],"elapsed":4.523760836,"_type":"aimessage"}]
