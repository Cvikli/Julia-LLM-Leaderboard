Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution using the markdown library:\n\n```python\nimport re\nfrom markdown import Markdown\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    md = Markdown()  # initialize Markdown parser\n    \n    # find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    blocks = re.findall(r'```julia(.+?)```', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # join together and remove code fences\n    joined_code = '\\n'.join([block[1:-1] for block in blocks])\n    \n    return joined_code\n```\n\nThe `re.findall` function is used to find all occurrences of the pattern `r'```julia(.+?)```'`, which matches code blocks with julia language. The `.+?` inside the pattern means \"match any character (except newline) one or more times, but as few times as possible\". The `re.DOTALL` flag allows the dot to match all characters including newlines.\n\nThen, list comprehension is used to remove code fences from each block of julia code: `[block[1:-1] for block in blocks]`. This slices off the first and last character of each string (which are the opening and closing code fence markers).\n\nFinally, all the joined code blocks are joined together with newline characters using the `'\\n'.join` function and returned. \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that there is only one julia language code block per markdown document. If multiple code blocks exist, they will be combined into a single string separated by newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,360],"elapsed":6.230711407,"_type":"aimessage"}]
