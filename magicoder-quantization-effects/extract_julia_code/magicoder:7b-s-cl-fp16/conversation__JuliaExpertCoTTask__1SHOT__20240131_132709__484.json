Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the function `extract_julia_code` in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regex\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```(.*?)\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    # If there are no matches, return an empty string\n    if isempty(matches)\n        return \"\"\n    end\n\n    code_blocks = String[]\n    for match in matches\n        lang, code = match.captures[1], match.captures[2]\n        \n        # If the language isn't Julia, skip this block\n        if lang != \"julia\"\n            continue\n        end\n\n        push!(code_blocks, code)\n    end\n    \n    # Join all code blocks together with a newline\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first finding all matches of the `code fence` pattern in your markdown document. It then checks each match to see if it's for Julia code (i.e., the language is \"julia\"). If so, it extracts and stores the code block in an array. Finally, it joins all the Julia code blocks together with a newline character.","status":200,"tokens":[0,303],"elapsed":5.249499968,"_type":"aimessage"}]
