[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the Julia language code blocks from markdown document:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    blocks = split(md, \"\\n```\")\n    codes = [block for block in blocks if startswith(block, \"julia\")]\n    joined_codes = join([replace(code, \"```julia\" => \"\") for code in codes], \"\\n\")\n    return strip(joined_codes)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the markdown text into blocks using newline character as separator. It then checks each block to see if it starts with `julia`. If it does, that means it's a Julia code block and it is added to the list of codes. The code fences are removed from these blocks and they are joined together. The resulting string is stripped of leading or trailing whitespaces before being returned.\n\nPlease note: This function assumes that there is no other language specified in the code block, only Julia. If you have code blocks with multiple languages, you'd need to adjust this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[388,260],"elapsed":4.570853984,"_type":"aimessage"}]
