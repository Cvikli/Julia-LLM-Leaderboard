The `collect(eachmatch(regex, md))` line collects all matches of the regular expression into an array. If no matches are found (i.e., there are no code blocks), it returns an empty string. Otherwise, it joins together all matched strings with a newline and returns this result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,227],"elapsed":3.915495456,"_type":"aimessage"}]
