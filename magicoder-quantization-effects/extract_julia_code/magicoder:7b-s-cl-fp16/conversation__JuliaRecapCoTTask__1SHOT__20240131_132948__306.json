[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might solve this problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)::String\n    code = \"\"\n    in_block = false\n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_block = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && in_block\n            in_block = false\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_block \n            code *= line[4:end] # Remove the '    ' prefix\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each line of the markdown document. When it encounters a line that starts with \"```julia\", it sets `in_block` to true, indicating that we are in a Julia code block. Similarly, if it encounters a line starting with \"```\" and `in_block` is true, it sets `in_block` to false, indicating that we have finished the Julia code block. \n\nIf `in_block` is true, it appends the content of each line (excluding the first four characters, which are used to denote the start of a code block) to the `code` variable.\n\nFinally, it returns the combined contents of all Julia code blocks in the markdown document.","status":200,"tokens":[0,318],"elapsed":5.56197502,"_type":"aimessage"}]
