Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of `extract_julia_code` in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regex\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    if isempty(matches)\n        return \"\"  # Return empty string if no code blocks found\n    end\n\n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    code = join([match[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\n\n    # Remove code fences (```julia\\n and \\n```)\n    code = replace(code, \"`\" => \"\")\n    \n    return code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression to find all the Julia language code blocks in the markdown document. It then joins these blocks together with newline characters, removes the fences (the ```julia\\n and \\n```) surrounding each block of code, and returns the resulting string. If there are no code blocks found in the input `md`, it simply returns an empty string.","status":200,"tokens":[118,257],"elapsed":4.447397558,"_type":"aimessage"}]
