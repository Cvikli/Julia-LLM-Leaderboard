[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple way to do this using regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    matches = collect.(eachmatch(r\"```julia(.*?)```\", md; overlapped=true))\n    \n    # join the code blocks together with a newline and remove the fences\n    code_blocks = join([replace(match.captures[1], r\"^```|``$\" => \"\") for match in matches]; \"\\n\")\n\n    return code_blocks\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by using regular expressions to find all occurrences of code blocks that start with ```julia and end with ``` (captured as `match.captures[1]`). The `collect.(eachmatch(...))` is used to collect the matches into an array of strings, which we then join together with a newline (`\"\\n\"`). The `replace(..., r\"^```|``$\" => \"\")` part removes the ``` and ``` fences from each code block.\n\nNote: This function assumes that there are no other types of markdown code blocks in your input string, since it is looking for code blocks that start with ```julia and end with ````. If you have other types of code blocks in your input, you might need to adjust the regular expression accordingly or use a more sophisticated approach.","status":200,"tokens":[0,316],"elapsed":5.452892483,"_type":"aimessage"}]
