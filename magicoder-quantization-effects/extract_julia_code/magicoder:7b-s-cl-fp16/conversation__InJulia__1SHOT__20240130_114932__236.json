[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    blocks = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    codeblocks = String[]\n\n    for block in blocks\n        if startswith(block, \"```julia\") || startswith(block, \"```Julia\")\n            push!(codeblocks, join([line[4:end] for line in split(block[7:-3], '\\n')]))\n        end\n    end\n\n    return join(codeblocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThe `extract_julia_code` function splits the input markdown document into separate blocks and then checks each block to see if it is a julia code block. If so, it strips off the code fencing (the 3 backticks) and appends the content of the block to a list `codeblocks`. After collecting all the code blocks, the function joins them together with newline characters (`\\n`) into a single string.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the julia code blocks are correctly formatted as \"```julia\" or \"```Julia\", and that they do not span multiple lines. If there is any chance that the input markdown might be malformed in these ways, you should add some error handling to deal with them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,311],"elapsed":5.443536303,"_type":"aimessage"}]
