[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is an implementation of this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Extract code blocks from the markdown string using regex pattern\n    blocks = matchall(r\"```julia(.*?)```\", md, re\"s\")\n    \n    if isempty(blocks)\n        return \"\"\n    end\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join all the code blocks together with newline character\n    cleaned_code = reduce((x, y)-> x * \"\\n\" * y, map(z -> replace(z, r\"```julia\" => \"\"), blocks))\n    \n    return cleaned_code\nend\n```\nThis function uses `matchall` and `reduce` from the Base library to extract all code blocks and then remove fences. It also utilizes a helper function to replace the fencing of Julia code in each block. \n\nThe regex pattern `r\"```julia(.*?)```` matches the entire code block. The `.*?` is a lazy quantifier that will match as few characters as possible until it can match the next part of the pattern, which is an empty string `\".*?\"`. The parentheses around `(.*?)` are used to capture this group into the result array, which we then process further in our code. \n\nPlease note that for full functionality, the function should be able to handle more complex scenarios such as escaped fences (i.e., fences preceded by an odd number of backticks), nested fenced code blocks, etc. This implementation assumes a simple scenario where all code blocks are properly fenced and do not overlap with each other or any surrounding text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,372],"elapsed":6.604167537,"_type":"aimessage"}]
