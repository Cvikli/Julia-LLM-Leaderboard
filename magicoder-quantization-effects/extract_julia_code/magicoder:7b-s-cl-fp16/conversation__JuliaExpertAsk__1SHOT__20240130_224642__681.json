Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of the function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = reduce((a, b) -> replace(b.captures[1], \"`\" => \"\"), code_blocks) * \"\\n\"\n    \n    return String(joined_code)\nend\n```\nIn this function, we use the `eachmatch` function to find all occurrences of the pattern \"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\". This pattern matches a string that starts with \"```julia\", followed by any characters (including none), and ends with \"\\n```\". The `reduce` function is then used to concatenate all these matched strings, replacing each match with its second capture group (i.e., the code inside the fences). Finally, we convert the result to a string and return it.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the markdown document is well-formed and does not contain nested or overlapping code blocks. If your documents can have these issues, you may need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,298],"elapsed":5.147852707,"_type":"aimessage"}]
