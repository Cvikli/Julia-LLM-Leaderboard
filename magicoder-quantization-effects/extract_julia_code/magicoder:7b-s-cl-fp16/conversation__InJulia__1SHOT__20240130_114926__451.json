The `matchall` function returns a list of substrings that match this regular expression. The collect parameter is set to true to store these matches in an array. \n\nThen, for each block we replace the code fences with nothing using the replace function and join them together into one string with \"\\n\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,241],"elapsed":4.22299641,"_type":"aimessage"}]
