[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise.

Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # Find all code blocks in markdown document\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```julia(.+?)```', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks with a newline\n    joined_code = '\\n'.join([block.strip() for block in code_blocks])\n    \n    return joined_code\n```\n\nThis function uses Python's built-in `re` module to find all occurrences of the pattern ```julia(.+?)``` (which matches a Julia code block) in the markdown document. The `.findall()` method returns a list of all non-overlapping matches of pattern in string, as a list of strings. The `re.DOTALL` flag makes the dot special character match any character at all, including a newline.\n\nThen it strips each code block and joins them with a newline using Python's built-in `join()` method.\n\nThis function assumes that there are no other triple backticks (````) in your markdown document. If there could be nested code blocks, you would need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,286],"elapsed":4.939309866,"_type":"aimessage"}]
