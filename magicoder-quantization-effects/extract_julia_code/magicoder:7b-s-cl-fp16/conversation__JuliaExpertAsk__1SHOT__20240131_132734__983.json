Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution using markdown library:\n\n```python\nimport markdown\nfrom markdown import Markdown\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    md = markdown.Markdown(extensions=['fenced_code'])\n    html = md.convert(md)\n    code_blocks = [x for x in html.split('<pre>') if '</pre>' in x]\n    \n    julia_code = ''\n    for block in code_blocks:\n        lang, code = block.split('\\n')\n        if 'julia' in lang:\n            julia_code += code + '\\n'\n            \n    return julia_code.strip()\n```\n\nThis function uses the `fenced_code` extension provided by markdown library to identify and extract fenced (i.e., code) blocks from the markdown text. It then checks each block to see if it is a Julia code block, if yes, it appends the code within that block to the final string.\n\nPlease note, this function assumes that all the code blocks in your markdown document are Julia code blocks and there's only one language per fenced code block. If you have mixed languages or more than one language per block, you would need a different approach. \n\nAlso, you will need to install `markdown` library if it is not installed yet:\n```bash\npip install markdown\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,320],"elapsed":5.530178522,"_type":"aimessage"}]
