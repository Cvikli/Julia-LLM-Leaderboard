[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of your problem description using the GitHub Markdown parsing library MdParse.jl in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing MdParse\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::Markdown)\n    code_blocks = findall(md, \"CodeBlock\")  # find all code blocks\n    raw_code = map(x -> x.content[1], code_blocks)  # extract the content of each block\n    julia_code = filter(x -> startswith(x, \"#!julia\"), raw_code)  # filter out non-Julia code blocks\n    join(julia_code; separator=\"\\n\")  # join together with newline\nend\n```\n\nThe function `extract_julia_code` firstly finds all the CodeBlock instances in the provided markdown document. Then it extracts the content of each block, and filters out blocks that don't start with `#!julia`. Finally, it joins together the Julia code blocks with a newline character.\n\nThis solution assumes that the Julia interpreter is used for code execution (i.e., `#!julia` is specified in each code block). If this is not the case, you can modify the function to filter out other languages instead. \n\nPlease note that this function will only work correctly if the markdown document uses standard GitHub Markdown syntax for code blocks and Julia interpreter specifications are used as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[0,319],"elapsed":5.654397472,"_type":"aimessage"}]
