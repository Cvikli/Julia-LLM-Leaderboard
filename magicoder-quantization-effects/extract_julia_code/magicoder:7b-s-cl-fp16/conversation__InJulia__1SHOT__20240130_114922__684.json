This function uses regular expressions to locate all Julia code blocks, remove them from the original markdown document and then join the remaining contents into a single string:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # The regex pattern matches any lines that start with four spaces (indicating a fenced code block in Markdown), \n    # followed by any character (except for a newline) and captures the actual code block into group 1.\n    pattern = r\"^ {4}(?s)(.*?)(?=\\n\\n|\\Z)\"\n    \n    matches = collect(eachmatch(pattern, md))\n    matched_blocks = join([match.captures[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Finally, remove the code fences from each block and concatenate all blocks into a single string.\n    final_code = replace.(split(matched_blocks, \"\\n\"), r\"^```|\\n```$\" => \"\") |> join\n    \n    return final_code\nend\n```\nThis function assumes that the input `md` is a multi-line string and every Julia code block starts with four spaces (as per Markdown syntax) and ends with three backticks (```). If your markdown document uses different formatting, you may need to adjust the regular expression pattern accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,318],"elapsed":5.584784714,"_type":"aimessage"}]
