It then concatenates these strings together with newline characters (`\"\\n\"`). \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the Julia code block is correctly formatted as ```julia\\n(code)\\n``` where `(code)` represents the actual Julia code, and `\\n` is a newline character. If your markdown document uses different formatting or has additional characters (e.g., indentation), you'll need to modify this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[88,259],"elapsed":4.477099465,"_type":"aimessage"}]
