[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(pattern, md))\n    \n    if length(matches) == 0\n        return \"\"\n    elseif length(matches) == 1\n        return replace(matches[1][1], \"\\n\"=>\" \")\n    else\n        return join([replace(m[1], \"\\n\"=>\" \") for m in matches], \"\\n\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression to match the code blocks. The `?` is used after `.*` to make it non-greedy, meaning it will stop matching as soon as possible, which prevents it from consuming too many characters and causing an error. The `\\n` inside the pattern matches newline characters, which are used to separate different parts of the code block.\n\nThe `collect(eachmatch(pattern, md))` function returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the matched part of the string (`matches[i][1]`) and its starting index (`matches[i][2]`).\n\nIf there is only one match, it simply replaces all newline characters with spaces in this one block of code. If there are multiple matches, it joins them together with a newline character.","status":200,"tokens":[0,312],"elapsed":5.455590543,"_type":"aimessage"}]
