Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use regular expressions to extract the code blocks and then join them together with a newline in between. Here's how you might implement this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all julia code blocks\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, greedy=false))\n    \n    # Extract the inner content of each block and join them together with a newline\n    joined_code = join([match.captures[1] for match in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `eachmatch` function from Julia's RegularExpressions module to find all matches of the regular expression `\"```julia(.+?)```\"`. The `.+?` part of the regex is a lazy match (`?`) that will match as few characters as possible, which allows it to correctly identify multiple consecutive code blocks. \n\nThe resulting array of matches (`code_blocks`) contains each code block as a `Substring` with the inner content of the code block in its first capture group (`match.captures[1]`). This is then passed to `join` along with a newline character (`\"\\n\"`), which concatenates all the inner contents together with a newline in between. \n\nNote that this function assumes that there are no nested ``` ``` code fences within the blocks, as it would be very difficult (if not impossible) to correctly handle those cases using regular expressions alone. If such cases need to be handled, you might want to use a more advanced parsing method like a parser generator or a full-fledged markdown parser library.","status":200,"tokens":[0,382],"elapsed":6.645469228,"_type":"aimessage"}]
