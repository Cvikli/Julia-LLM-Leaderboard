Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution for the given problem:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # find all code block using regex pattern \n    blocks = re.findall(r'```(.*?)```', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    if not blocks:   # If no code blocks found return None\n        return None\n    \n    # join the code blocks and remove fences\n    joined_code = '\\n'.join([block.strip('`') for block in blocks])\n    \n    return joined_code\n```\n\nThis function first finds all the code blocks using a regular expression (`re.findall(r'```(.*?)```', md, re.DOTALL)`) which matches three backticks followed by any characters (`.*?`) until it encounters three backticks again. It sets `re.DOTALL` flag to make the dot in regex match newline as well. \n\nIf no code blocks are found (`if not blocks: return None`), the function returns None. Otherwise, it joins all the code blocks together with a newline character (`'\\n'`), and removes any leading or trailing backticks from each block (`strip('`')`). This is done with list comprehension - `[block.strip('`') for block in blocks]`.\n\nThis function will work as long as your markdown document follows standard Markdown syntax where code blocks are delineated by three backticks (````...) and a newline.","status":200,"tokens":[0,332],"elapsed":5.837523929,"_type":"aimessage"}]
