[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Your task doesn't require any special instructions because it's straightforward:\n\n- Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline.\n- Return a String.\n\nHere is how you might implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # find all code blocks and strip code fences\n    code_blocks = replace.(split(md, \"\\n```julia\"), \"`\" => \"\")\n    \n    # remove first empty block if present\n    if isempty(first(code_blocks))\n        popfirst!(code_blocks)\n    end\n\n    # join all code blocks with newline and strip leading/trailing whitespace\n    result = join([strip(c) for c in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return result\nend\n``` \n\nThis function works by first splitting the markdown string into an array of strings using the newline character (`\"\\n\"`). The `split` method uses the string \"`\" as a delimiter, and `replace` replaces each instance of \"`\" with nothing. This effectively strips away the code fences from the code blocks.\n\nNext, we check if the first block is empty (which would happen if there were no code before the first fence). If so, we remove it from our resulting array using `popfirst!`.\n\nFinally, we join all the remaining strings together into a single string with newline characters between each element. We use `strip` to eliminate any leading or trailing whitespace that might have been introduced when removing the code fences.","status":200,"tokens":[0,377],"elapsed":6.68011233,"_type":"aimessage"}]
