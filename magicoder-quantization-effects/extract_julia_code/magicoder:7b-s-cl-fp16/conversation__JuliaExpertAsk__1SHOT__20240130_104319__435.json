Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a python solution using the markdown library to parse the markdown document:\n```python\nimport markdown\nfrom markdown import Markdown\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    md_instance = Markdown()\n    html = md_instance.convert(md)\n    \n    # Find all code blocks in HTML and join them with a newline\n    codes = [block for block in html.split('<pre><code class=\"julia\">')[1:]]\n    codes = [''.join([line for line in block.strip().split('\\n') if line.strip() != '']) \n             for block in codes]\n    \n    # Join the code blocks with a newline\n    return '\\n'.join(codes)\n```\nThis function first converts the markdown document to HTML using Markdown's `convert` method. Then it splits this HTML by `<pre><code class=\"julia\">`, which separates all the Julia language code blocks from the rest of the HTML. It then joins these blocks together with a newline, removing any empty lines.\n\nPlease note that you would need to install markdown library if not already installed:\n```bash\npip install markdown\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,269],"elapsed":4.711352977,"_type":"aimessage"}]
