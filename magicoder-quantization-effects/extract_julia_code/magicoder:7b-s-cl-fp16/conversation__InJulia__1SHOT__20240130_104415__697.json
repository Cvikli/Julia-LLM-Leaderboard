The resulting matches are tuples where the first element is the whole match and the second one is everything inside the backticks. \n\nNext, we use the `mapreduce` function combined with the `replace` function to remove the backticks from the code blocks. This replaces each occurrence of \"`\" with an empty string, effectively removing them. Finally, we use the `strip` function to remove any leading or trailing whitespace that might have been introduced by the replaced characters. \n\nThe resulting string is then returned as output.","status":200,"tokens":[0,283],"elapsed":4.937640183,"_type":"aimessage"}]
