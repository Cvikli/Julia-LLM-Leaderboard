[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    blocks = split(replace(md, \"```\" => \"\\n\\n\"), \"\\n\\n\")[2:end] # remove first block and split into code blocks\n    joined_code = join([block[4:end-3] for block in blocks], \"\\n\")  # remove fences from code blocks\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nThis function splits the provided markdown string by \"```\" to get all of the code blocks. It then joins these blocks together, removing the language specification and the ``` marks around each block. The result is returned as a String. \n\nNote that the task asked to join all code blocks with a newline, but it's important to note that this does not necessarily mean every line in the output will be separated by a newline, especially if there are multiple lines of code in a single block. If you want every line to be on its own line (for example, for proper formatting), you would need to add additional logic to handle that.","status":200,"tokens":[0,254],"elapsed":1.983498383,"_type":"aimessage"}]
