[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise.

Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation in Python:\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # Find all Julia code blocks using regex\n    julia_blocks = re.findall(r'```julia(.*?)```', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # If no Julia code blocks were found return empty string\n    if not julia_blocks:\n        return ''\n    \n    # Join all the Julia code blocks together with a newline and remove any leading/trailing whitespace or newlines\n    joined_code = '\\n'.join(julia_block.strip() for julia_block in julia_blocks)\n    \n    return joined_code\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to match the Julia code blocks in your markdown document. The `re.findall` method returns a list of all matches, and we pass this into `join` to concatenate the matches with newline characters between them. Each item in the list is a string that represents a code block - we use a generator expression with `strip` to remove leading or trailing whitespace, including any newline characters. If there were no Julia code blocks found, an empty string is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,269],"elapsed":2.075198237,"_type":"aimessage"}]
