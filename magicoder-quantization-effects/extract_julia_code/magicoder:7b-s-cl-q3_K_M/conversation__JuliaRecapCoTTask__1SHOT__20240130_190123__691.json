[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can write the function `extract_julia_code` in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regular expression to match code blocks.\n    regex = r\"```julia(.+?)```\"\n    \n    matches = collect(eachmatch(regex, md, greedy=false)) \n    \n    if isempty(matches) \n        return \"\"\n    end\n    \n    codes = [match[1] for match in matches] # Extract code content.\n    \n    join(codes, \"\\n\") # Join the code blocks with a newline.\nend\n```\n\nThis function `extract_julia_code` will extract all the Julia code blocks from the given markdown document and remove the fences surrounding them. The `eachmatch` function in Julia returns an iterator of Match objects, each representing a match found in the string. If there are no matches, it returns an empty collection (an empty Array).\n\nThe function then extracts the code content using `match[1]` for each Match object and joins them with \"\\n\" (a newline character) into a single String. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the markdown document is well-formed and does not have nested or overlapping fences, and it only extracts Julia code blocks. If you need to handle such edge cases, you would need to modify the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,326],"elapsed":2.596695416,"_type":"aimessage"}]
