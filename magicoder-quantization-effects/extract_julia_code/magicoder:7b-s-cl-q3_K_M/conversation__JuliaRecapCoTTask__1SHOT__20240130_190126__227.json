[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can solve this problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    code_lines = String[]\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if line[1] == '`' && !isempty(line) \n            next_line = line[2]\n            if next_line == '`'\n                push!(code_lines, join(split(line[3:end], \"```\"))...)\n            elseif next_line == 'j' || next_line == 's'\n                push!(code_lines, join(split(line[4:end], \"```\"), \"\\n\"))\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(code_lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the markdown document into lines and then checking each line to see if it's a code block. If it is, it adds all of that block's lines to `code_lines` in order. The result is the concatenation of all these lines, separated by newlines. \n\nThe special instructions should be given in the markdown document as text enclosed within backticks (`) on either side. This function does not account for multi-line code blocks or any other special cases that might arise from the actual markdown syntax. It also assumes that a code block starts and ends with a line of three backticks (```). You should modify this according to your needs.","status":200,"tokens":[0,337],"elapsed":2.680082399,"_type":"aimessage"}]
