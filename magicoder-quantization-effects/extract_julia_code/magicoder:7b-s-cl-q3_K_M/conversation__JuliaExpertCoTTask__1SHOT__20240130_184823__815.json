[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```(.*?)\\n(.*?)```', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # join code without fences and remove leading/trailing whitespace\n    code = ''.join([re.sub('^ {4}|\\n{2,}|\\n$', '', block[1]) for block in code_blocks])\n    \n    return code\n```\nThis function uses the Python `re` module to find all code blocks in the markdown document with `re.findall(r'```(.*?)\\n(.*?)```'`. The `.*?` is a non-greedy match meaning it will stop at the closest possible point, this is what allows us to match multiple consecutive code fences as separate matches. Inside each code block, we then remove any leading/trailing whitespace (code blocks start and end with 4 spaces or newline characters) and join all together with a newline `\\n`.\n\nNote that you can use `re.DOTALL` to make `.*?` match across multiple lines in the re.findall function call.","status":200,"tokens":[0,276],"elapsed":2.145659706,"_type":"aimessage"}]
