[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function `extract_julia_code` that meets the requirements:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regex pattern to match code blocks in markdown\n    re = r\"^```.*?\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(re, md, init=Ptr{UInt8}(0)))\n    \n    # Join the matched blocks into a single string with newline characters between each block.\n    joined_code = join([m.captures[1] for m in matches], \"\\n\\n\") \n\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to match code fences (```...```) which delineate code blocks in the markdown, then collects all matches into an array `matches`. It iterates over this array and extracts the first (and only) subgroup, a string of the captured block. The resulting strings are joined with a newline character between each. \n\nThis function assumes that there's exactly one code block per fence (i.e., it doesn't account for nested blocks). Also note that this solution uses Julia's built-in regular expressions, which is compatible with PCRE patterns and has a lot of flexibility. However, this specific pattern may not cover all possible scenarios, so you may need to tweak the pattern if your markdown files are significantly different. \n\nRemember, when testing, make sure that your `md` input string contains one or more code blocks for the function to work correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[422,350],"elapsed":13.906592037,"_type":"aimessage"}]
