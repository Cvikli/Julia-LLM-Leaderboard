[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise. You're precise and answer only when you're confident in the high quality of your answer.","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Question\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use regular expressions to match these blocks of code. Here is one possible implementation:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(pattern, md))\n    \n    # Extract code blocks and remove ```julia\\n from the beginning of each block\n    code_blocks = [replace(m.captures[1], r\"```julia\\n\" => \"\") for m in matches]\n\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to match the pattern of a julia language block. The `?` after `.*` makes it non-greedy and stops at the first occurrence of what comes before it. Then it collects all matches into an array of MatchObjects, from which each match's captured group (the actual code) is extracted with the `captures[1]` index and stored in a new array (`code_blocks`). The function finally returns a string that joins all these blocks with newline characters.\n  \nPlease note that you need to call this function with a String variable that contains your markdown document as an input.","status":200,"tokens":[0,277],"elapsed":2.152580402,"_type":"aimessage"}]
