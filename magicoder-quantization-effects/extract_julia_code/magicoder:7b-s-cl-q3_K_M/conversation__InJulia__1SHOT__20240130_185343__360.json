The function `extract_julia_code` will do exactly what you've described. \n```Julia\nusing RegularExpressions\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seperators=true))\n    \n    code_blocks = join([m.captures[1] for m in matches], \"\\n\")\n    return replace(code_blocks, r\"^```\\n|\\n```$\"=>\"\")\nend\n```\nThe function `extract_julia_code` takes a String as input (`md`) which is the markdown document with julia code blocks. It extracts all matches using `eachmatch`. Each match is a SubString from where we take the first capture, i.e., the part of text enclosed in backticks (```\\n...\\n```). The extracted code blocks are joined together with newline character.\nAfter that, it removes any leading or trailing \"```\" using `replace`. This function returns a String containing all julia code blocks as one concatenated String separated by newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,270],"elapsed":2.068637284,"_type":"aimessage"}]
