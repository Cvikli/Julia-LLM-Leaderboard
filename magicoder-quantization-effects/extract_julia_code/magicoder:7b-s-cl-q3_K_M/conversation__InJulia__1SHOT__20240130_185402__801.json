[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you could write this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    code_blocks = []\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```\")\n            push!(code_blocks, [])\n        end\n        if length(code_blocks) > 0 && !startswith(line, \"```\")\n            append!(code_blocks[end], split(line))\n        end\n    end\n\n    result = \"\"\n    for block in code_blocks\n        result *= join(block, \"\\n\") * \"\\n\"\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the input string into an array of lines. It then iterates over each line, adding it to a new block when it encounters a code fence (i.e., when `line` starts with \"```\"). If it encounters another fence, it appends all the lines in that block to the current block and continues. When there are no more blocks left, it combines all the blocks into one string separated by newline characters, which is then returned. \n\nPlease note: This function assumes that the markdown document starts with a code block. If not, you may need to modify it to account for that possibility.","status":200,"tokens":[0,311],"elapsed":2.381597673,"_type":"aimessage"}]
