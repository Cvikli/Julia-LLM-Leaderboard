Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this using regex in Python:\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # Find all code blocks\n    code_blocks = re.findall('\\n(`{3,})(.*?)\\n\\1', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # Join the blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = '\\n'.join(code_blocks).strip()\n    \n    return joined_code\n```\nThis function works by using regex to find all code blocks in the markdown document (`md`). The expression `\\n(` finds lines that start with a newline and `({3,})` matches three or more opening backticks (which is Julia's syntax for starting a code block). The `.*?` matches any character (non-greedy) until it hits the closing backticks.\n\nThe joined_code then strips leading/trailing whitespace and returns the combined code blocks as a single string.\n\nNote that if there are multiple code blocks, this function will join them with newlines. If you want to put an additional newline after each block, change `.join(code_blocks)` into `'\\n\\n'.join(code_blocks)`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,277],"elapsed":2.166688332,"_type":"aimessage"}]
