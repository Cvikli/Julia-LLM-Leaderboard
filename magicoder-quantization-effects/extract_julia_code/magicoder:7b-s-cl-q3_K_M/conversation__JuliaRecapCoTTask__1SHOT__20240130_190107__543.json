[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can approach this problem:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code = \"\"\n    in_block = false\n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_block = true\n            nextline(IOBuffer(md)) # skip the `###` or other language specification\n        elseif in_block && endswith(line, \"```\")\n            in_block = false\n            code *= \"\\n\" * String(take!(IOBuffer(line)))\n            break\n        elseif in_block\n            code *= String(take!(IOBuffer(line)))\n        end\n    end\n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function reads line by line from the markdown document and checks if it's a Julia language code block. If so, it appends the lines into `code` while skipping the first (fence) line. After exiting the block, it breaks out of the loop to stop processing further lines.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes your markdown document is a string and does not handle any edge cases or exceptions. It's also worth mentioning that Markdown language specifications are very loose and may vary across different software. This code works on the assumption that `###` is used to denote language, but might not work for all flavors of Markdown.","status":200,"tokens":[425,320],"elapsed":10.913325707,"_type":"aimessage"}]
