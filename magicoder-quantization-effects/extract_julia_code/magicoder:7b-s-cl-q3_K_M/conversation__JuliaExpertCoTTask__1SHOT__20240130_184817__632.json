If it encounters a line that starts with ``` (indicating a code block), it adds the current block to `code_blocks` and clears `current_block`. If it encounters a line within a block that doesn't start with a space, it adds a newline before appending the line to the current block. This way, multi-line blocks are properly joined together.","status":200,"tokens":[0,316],"elapsed":2.449982711,"_type":"aimessage"}]
