Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple Python solution using regular expressions:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # This pattern matches the start and end of a code block in markdown, \n    # and also removes the \"```\" code fences.\n    pattern = r'```julia\\n(.*?)```'\n    \n    # Find all matches\n    matches = re.findall(pattern, md, re.DOTALL)\n\n    # Join them together with a newline\n    joined_code = \"\\n\".join(matches)\n    \n    return joined_code\n```\nThis function assumes that there are no nested code blocks in your markdown document and that all code blocks start and end with \"```julia\" and \"```\", respectively. It also assumes that the markdown input is a string. \n\nIf you want to handle more complex scenarios (nested code blocks, other languages besides Julia), you would need a different solution which might involve parsing the markdown instead of using regular expressions.","status":200,"tokens":[0,231],"elapsed":1.796759113,"_type":"aimessage"}]
