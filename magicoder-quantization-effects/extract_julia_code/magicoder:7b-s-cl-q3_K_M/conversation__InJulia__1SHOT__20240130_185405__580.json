If it sees a `start` of a Julia code block, it starts appending the lines of that code block into `code`. If it sees an end of a code block (```), and there is currently some code being collected (i.e., it's not at the start of a new block), it finishes collecting that block and pushes it onto our `codeblocks` array.\n\nFinally, if there are multiple blocks of code, we join them together with `\\n` to get a single string, which is returned by the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,465],"elapsed":3.645207924,"_type":"aimessage"}]
