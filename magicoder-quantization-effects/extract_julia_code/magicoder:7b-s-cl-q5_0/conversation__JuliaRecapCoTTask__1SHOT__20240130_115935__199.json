[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is an example of how you might go about creating this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Regular expression to find Julia code blocks in the markdown text\n    regex = r\"```julia(?=\\n)(.*?)```\"s\n    \n    # Find all matches of Julia code blocks and their content\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(regex, md)) \n    codes = map(m -> match(r\"\\n(.*)\\n\", m.captures[1][2])[1], matches)\n\n    # Join the matches with a newline in between\n    code_joined = join(codes, \"\\n\")\n    \n    return code_joined\nend\n```\n\nPlease note that this function uses regular expressions to find all code blocks in the markdown text. The function `extract_julia_code` takes as input a String `md`, which should be the markdown document from where you want to extract Julia code. It returns a String, which is the joined code blocks with newlines between them.\n\nPlease also note that this solution assumes that there are no additional backticks or new lines within the Julia code blocks themselves. If these possibilities exist in your `md`, then you should adjust the regular expression to account for those scenarios.","status":200,"tokens":[0,295],"elapsed":2.616548489,"_type":"aimessage"}]
