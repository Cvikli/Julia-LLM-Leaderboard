It then joins these into a single string, with each line separated by a newline character (`\\n`). The code fences (the ``` and ``` pairs) are removed from this string using the `replace` function. \n\nThe resulting string contains all the julia code blocks from the markdown document, concatenated together with newlines between them. If there are no julia code blocks in the document, an empty string is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,288],"elapsed":2.472901579,"_type":"aimessage"}]
