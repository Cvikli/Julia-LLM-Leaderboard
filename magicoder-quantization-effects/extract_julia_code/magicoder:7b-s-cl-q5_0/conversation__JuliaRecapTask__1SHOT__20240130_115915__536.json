[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The provided markdown document `md` is assumed to be a string that contains one or more julia code blocks enclosed in triple backticks (````julia). Here's how you can extract and process these code blocks:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Find all code blocks using regular expression\n    regex = r\"```julia([\\s\\S]*?)```\"\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(Regex(regex), md))\n\n    if isempty(code_blocks)\n        return \"\"\n    end\n\n    # Extract the actual code from each block and remove code fences\n    codes = map(m -> m.captures[1], code_blocks)\n\n    # Join all the codes together with a newline in between\n    code = join([strip(c, ['\\n']) for c in codes]; '\\n') * \"\\n\"\n\n    return code\nend\n```\n\nThe `extract_julia_code` function works as follows: \n- It defines a regular expression to match the julia code blocks. The `([\\s\\S]*?)` part matches any character (including newline) lazily, which means it will stop matching when it meets the next occurrence of the pattern or end of input.\n- It then finds all code blocks in the markdown document using the regular expression and collects them into an array `code_blocks`.\n- If there are no code blocks, it returns an empty string `\"\"`.\n- The actual codes from each block is extracted using map with a lambda function that strips out the backticks.\n- Finally, all the codes are joined together with a newline in between and returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,391],"elapsed":3.477756927,"_type":"aimessage"}]
