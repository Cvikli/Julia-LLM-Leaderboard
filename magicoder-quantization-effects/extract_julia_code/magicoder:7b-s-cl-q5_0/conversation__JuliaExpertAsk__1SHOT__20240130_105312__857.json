Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Python solution for your problem:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    pattern = r'```julia\\n(.*?)```'\n    matches = re.findall(pattern, md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    return '\\n'.join(matches).strip()\n```\n\nIn this code, `re.findall` is used to find all the occurrences of strings that match the pattern. The `.*?` part inside the pattern makes it non-greedy, so that it matches the smallest possible amount of characters until it encounters a closing ``` mark.\nThe `strip()` function is used to remove any leading or trailing white spaces from the joined string.\n\nThis code assumes that all code blocks are correctly formatted with three backticks (`` ```) and 'julia' on the second line as a language specification, but it doesn't check for syntax errors. Also, there could be multiple julia code blocks in one markdown document separated by blank lines.\n\nIf you want to use this function for your needs, ensure that `md` is a string with valid Julia code blocks formatted according to the rules specified above and also handle edge cases properly as per your requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,276],"elapsed":2.376113621,"_type":"aimessage"}]
