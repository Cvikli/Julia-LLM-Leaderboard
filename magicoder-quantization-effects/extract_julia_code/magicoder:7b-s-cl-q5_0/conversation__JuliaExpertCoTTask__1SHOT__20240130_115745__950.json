[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

We replace those strings with an empty string using the `replace` function.\n\nYou can then call the function like so:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\n```julia\nfor i=1:5\n    println(i)\nend\n```\n\"\"\"\nextract_julia_code(md)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[254,261],"elapsed":4.150084805,"_type":"aimessage"}]
