[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you might implement this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Define a regular expression to match code blocks\n    regex = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(regex, md))\n    \n    # Extract the captured groups from each match\n    code_blocks = mapreduce((m) -> m.captures[1], vcat, matches)\n    \n    return join([replace(x, r\"```julia\\n\" => \"\") for x in split(code_blocks, \"\\n\")], \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to match and extract the Julia code blocks from the input markdown document. It then joins all of these code blocks together into a single string without any of the surrounding code fences (i.e., ```julia\\n and \\n```). The `join` and `split` functions are used to add newline characters between each block of code, resulting in a single string.\n\nNote: This function assumes that all code blocks in your markdown document use the format ````julia\\n{code}\\n````. If they use different formats or contain other content (like comments), you might need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[88,297],"elapsed":2.575893146,"_type":"aimessage"}]
