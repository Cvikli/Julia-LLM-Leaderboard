Note that it assumes that each code block starts with \"```julia\" to identify a Julia language code block, and ends with \"```\". It also ignores any code block that contains only a single line of code since they are not typically used in multi-line code blocks in Julia.\n\nRemember that this solution assumes the markdown document is well-formed HTML and does not contain nested code tags or any other unforeseen issues that might occur with real world inputs. The solution also assumes that each code block is on its own line (which is a common formatting for markdown documents).","status":200,"tokens":[0,377],"elapsed":3.243841754,"_type":"aimessage"}]
