Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Python solution using BeautifulSoup library:\n\n```python\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(md, 'html.parser')\n    code_blocks = [re.sub('^```.*?\\n|```$', '', str(code)) for code in soup.find_all('code')]\n    joined_julia_code = '\\n'.join(code_blocks)\n    return joined_julia_code\n```\nThis function works by parsing the markdown document into a BeautifulSoup object, which allows us to use its `find_all` method to get all `<code>` tags in the markdown. Each code block is then passed to `str()` and `re.sub()`, which removes any ```...``` around the code (the code fences).\n\nPlease note that this assumes there's only one language used for code blocks, if other languages are present it may not work as expected. The code also uses regex (regular expressions) which could lead to unexpected behaviour with more complex code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[0,250],"elapsed":2.131270468,"_type":"aimessage"}]
