Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Regex to find julia code blocks\n    regex = r\"```julia\\n((?:.|\\n)*?)```\"\n    \n    matches = collect(eachmatch(regex, md))\n    \n    if isempty(matches)\n        return \"\"\n    end\n    \n    # Remove the triple backticks and join all code blocks together with newline\n    joined_code = reduce((a, b)->a*\"\\n\"*b.captures[1], matches) do a, b\n        b.captures[1]\n    end\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nThis function first finds all code blocks in the markdown document using a regular expression (`regex`). It then reduces the list of matches into one big string where each code block is joined by a newline character. This function assumes that there will be at least one code block in the input markdown and does not check for this case.","status":200,"tokens":[0,226],"elapsed":1.933488901,"_type":"aimessage"}]
