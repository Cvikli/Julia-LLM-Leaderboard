Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function in Julia. \n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find code blocks, remove the fences, and join the blocks together with a newline.\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md)) # Find all code blocks \n    if isempty(code_blocks) \n        return \"\"\n    end\n    code_str = reduce((x, y)-> x*\"\\n\"*y.captures[1], code_blocks)[7:end] # Remove fences and join with newline\n    return code_str\nend\n```\nThis function takes a string `md` as input and returns a String of all Julia code blocks joined by newlines.
