Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an implementation in Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    pattern = r'```julia(.+?)```'\n    code_blocks = re.findall(pattern, md, re.DOTALL)\n    julia_code = \"\\n\".join(code_blocks).strip()\n    return julia_code\n```\n\nExplanation:\nThis function uses regular expressions to match all the Julia language code blocks in the provided markdown document. The `re.findall` method returns a list of all matches, and we join them together with newline characters. Finally, I use `.strip()` to remove any leading or trailing whitespace.","status":200,"tokens":[0,161],"elapsed":1.382630361,"_type":"aimessage"}]
