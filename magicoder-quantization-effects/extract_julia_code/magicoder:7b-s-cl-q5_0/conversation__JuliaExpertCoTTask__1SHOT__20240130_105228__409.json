[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md) \n    # find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    code_blocks = [m.match for m in eachmatch(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, re\"is\")]\n    \n    # remove backticks from beginning and end of each block of code \n    code_blocks = [join([x[3:end-3] for x in split(b, '\\n')], '\\n') for b in code_blocks]\n    \n    # join all code blocks together with newline character\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function works by using regex (regular expressions) to find all occurrences of Julia code blocks. It then removes the markdown syntax (``` and ````) from each block of code and joins them into a single string with newline characters between each block of code. \n\nNote: This assumes that your input is just one long string containing all the Markdown text, which includes the Julia code fenced by triple backticks. If your input is an array or list of strings representing separate blocks of markdown text, you would need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[254,284],"elapsed":4.229896894,"_type":"aimessage"}]
