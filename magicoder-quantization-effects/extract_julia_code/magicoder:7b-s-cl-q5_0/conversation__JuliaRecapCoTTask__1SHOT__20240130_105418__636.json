[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here's how you could create this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks\n    blocks = matchall(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, capture=1).map do str -> str.strip(\"\\n\")\n        if contains(str, '\\n')  # If there are multiple lines of code\n            join(split(str, '\\n')[2:end], \"\\n\")  # Join with a newline\n        else\n            str  # Single line code block remains as it is.\n        end\n    end\n\n    join(blocks)\nend\n```\n\nIn this function:\n- `matchall` from the Matching library is used to find all occurrences of the pattern ```julia(.+?)``` in the markdown document, and returns an array of matches.\n- The first element of each match is captured into a variable named 'str'.\n- If there's a newline character ('\\n') in `str`, it means the code block spans multiple lines. In this case, all lines except the initial fence are joined together with '\\n', effectively removing the code fences and combining the code blocks into one string. Otherwise, return the single line of code as is.\n- Finally, join all resulting strings together to form a single output string.\n\nNote: If you're using this function in a script or notebook that doesn't automatically import Matching, you can add `using Matching` at the top of your file.\n\nRemember that this function will only work correctly if the markdown document contains exactly three back-ticks (` ``` `) for each code block and does not include any nested code blocks. If there are any such cases in the input, it would require a more complex solution to handle them correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,412],"elapsed":3.656268587,"_type":"aimessage"}]
