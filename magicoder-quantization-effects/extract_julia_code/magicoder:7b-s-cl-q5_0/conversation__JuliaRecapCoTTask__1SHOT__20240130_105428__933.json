[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you might solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code = \"\"\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    in_block = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")  # start of code block\n            in_block = true\n        elseif in_block && endswith(line, \"```\")  # end of code block\n            in_block = false\n        elseif in_block  # in a code block\n            if length(code) > 0\n                code *= \"\\n\"\n            end\n            code *= line[6:end-3]  # remove code fences\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return code\nend\n```\n\nThis function splits the input markdown document into lines. It checks each line for the start and end of a Julia code block (`\"code\"`) or the text within a code block (`line[6:end-3]`, removing the `...` surrounding it). If the current line is in a code block, it appends the text to the accumulating `code`. The function then joins all the lines together into a single string.\n\nNote that this function assumes that Julia code blocks are delimited by triple backticks (````julia...```) on their own lines. If they're part of a larger block of text, you may need to adjust the start and end conditions in the if-elseif-else structure accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,348],"elapsed":3.074311267,"_type":"aimessage"}]
