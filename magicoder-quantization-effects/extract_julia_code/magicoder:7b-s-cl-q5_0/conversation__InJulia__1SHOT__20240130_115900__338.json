It starts by splitting the markdown document into lines. Then it goes through each line to check if it's a start of code block (`\"```julia\"`). If so, it collects all following lines until the end of the code block (denoted by `\"``\"`), and then adds this collected code to `code_blocks`. It repeats the process for all blocks. Finally, it joins the code blocks into one string with newline characters between them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,409],"elapsed":3.489845625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
