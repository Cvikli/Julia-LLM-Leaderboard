[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you might solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    codeblocks = String[]\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    start = false\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, '```' && endswith(line, '```'))\n            start ^= true\n        elseif start \n            push!(codeblocks, strip(line[4:end-3]))\n        end\n    end\n    join(codeblocks, '\\n')\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each line of the markdown document. If a line starts and ends with three backticks (```), it toggles the `start` variable on or off. When `start` is true, it removes the code fence from each line (first four characters are '```' and last four are '```') and adds the stripped string to an array of Julia code blocks. Finally, it joins all the code blocks together into a single string with newline characters between them and returns this string.\n  \nThe function `startswith` checks whether the string starts with the specified pattern and `endswith` does the same for the end of the string. The caret (^) operator is used to toggle the boolean value of `start`. \n\nRemember, markdown code fences are not allowed to contain any whitespace at the start or end, so this function assumes that there won't be any. If that were a concern, you could add some error-checking logic to handle cases where it encounters such lines of text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,363],"elapsed":3.198008312,"_type":"aimessage"}]
