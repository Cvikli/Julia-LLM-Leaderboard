We use `re.findall` to find all occurrences of strings that match the pattern `' ```julia(.+?)``` '`. The argument `re.DOTALL` makes sure that `.` matches any character including newline characters. This captures the content within the code fences.\n2. Then we join these captured code blocks into one string separated by newline characters using `\\n`.join().\n3. Finally, replace all occurrences of newline characters in the joined code with nothing using `replace('\\n', '')` to remove any newline characters that may exist from the original code blocks. \n\nPlease note that this assumes your Julia code is within triple backticks (`` ```) as a code block and does not include inline julia syntax or comments (those would need special handling).","status":200,"tokens":[0,290],"elapsed":2.485393265,"_type":"aimessage"}]
