[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can write this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks and remove the fences around them \n    code_blocks = replace.(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md), r\"\\n\" => \"\")\n    \n    # Join all code blocks together with newline character\n    joined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nThis function uses a regular expression to match the code block delimiters. The `.*?` in the regex is a non-greedy match, which means it will find the shortest possible match and stop at the first occurrence of `\\n``` after matching `\"` for the fence. If there are multiple code blocks, they get concatenated with newline characters in between.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes you are passing in a string that is your markdown document where julia language code snippets are embedded within ```julia\\n...\\n``` delimiters. It will not work correctly if the fences or other parts of the syntax do not match those expected by this implementation.\n\nThe function also assumes that there's no extra whitespace or newline characters in the code blocks. If there is, you may need to add some preprocessing steps to remove these before running the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,314],"elapsed":2.780291977,"_type":"aimessage"}]
