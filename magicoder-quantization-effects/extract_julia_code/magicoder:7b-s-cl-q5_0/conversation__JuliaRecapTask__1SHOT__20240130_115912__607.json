[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    blocks = split(md, \"\\n```julia\\n\")\n    code = \"\"\n    for block in blocks[2:end] # exclude first part\n        code *= replace(block, \"```\", \"\")\n    end\n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function takes a markdown document as input and splits it by the julia language code fences. It then iterates through each block of code, removes the code fence from the block, and appends it to `code`. The final code string is returned.\n\nHowever, this solution assumes that there is only one code block in the markdown document. If you want to join all code blocks together regardless of their location within the document or if there are multiple consecutive code blocks, you can modify the function as follows:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    blocks = split(md, \"\\n```julia\\n\")\n    return join([replace(block, \"```\", \"\") for block in blocks[2:end]], \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nIn this version of the function, a new array is created by iterating over all code blocks and replacing the code fences. This array is then joined together with newline characters and returned as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,324],"elapsed":2.864715529,"_type":"aimessage"}]
