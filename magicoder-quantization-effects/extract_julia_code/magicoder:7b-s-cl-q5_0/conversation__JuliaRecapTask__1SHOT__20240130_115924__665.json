[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem by using regular expressions in Julia to match and remove markdown's fenced code blocks. Here is how you could define the function `extract_julia_code` in a simplified way:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Using regex to find all code blocks in Markdown document\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n    \n    # Find matches\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(pattern, md))\n    \n    # Extract and join the code blocks (if there are multiple) with a newline\n    code_blocks = [match.captures[1] for match in matches]\n    joined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\n\n    return joined_code\nend\n``` \n\nThis function uses the RegEx pattern ```julia\\n(.*?)\\n``` to find all fenced code blocks with Julia language. The `.*?` is a lazy quantifier that matches any character (except for newline) between the start and end of the fenced block. The `s` flag after the regular expression means it is a \"dot-all\" regex, which makes the dot match any character including newlines. \n\nThe function then extracts all these matched strings using the `captures` property and joins them together into one string with two newline characters (`\\n\\n`) between each block of code.\n  \nPlease note that this solution assumes that there is no need to parse or escape any special characters in the code blocks (like backticks). If the input markdown document can contain complex fenced code blocks, a more sophisticated parser would be needed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,379],"elapsed":3.370266353,"_type":"aimessage"}]
