It splits the markdown into an array of substrings, where each substring is a code block. Then, it strips off leading or trailing whitespace from each code block and joins them together with newline characters in between. The `[3:end]` means it skips the first three empty strings that are produced by splitting at the start and end of the string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,199],"elapsed":1.723274734,"_type":"aimessage"}]
