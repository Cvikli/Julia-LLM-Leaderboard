[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You will need to use the `Markdown` package from Julia's Package Manager (`Pkg`) to parse the markdown document and extract code blocks. Here is a simple function that does this:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\nimport Base: isempty\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    parsed = parse_md(md)\n    \n    # Iterate over elements in the parsed markdown document\n    for element in parsed.content\n        if isa(element, Paragraph)\n            # If it's a paragraph, iterate over its content (inlines)\n            for inline in element.content\n                if isa(inline, CodeBlock) && inline.language == \"julia\"\n                    code = join([line.string for line in inline.code], \"\\n\")\n                    return strip(code) # Remove leading/trailing white space\n                end\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return \"\" # Return an empty string if no julia code block was found\nend\n```\nThis function will loop over all elements in the parsed markdown document and check if each element is a `CodeBlock` with Julia as its language. If it finds such a block, it combines all lines of code into one long string (with newline characters) and returns that string. If no such block is found after looping through all elements, an empty string is returned.\n\nNote: The function `parse_md()` parses the markdown document into an AbstractSyntaxTree (AST), which represents the content as a tree of objects. This helps to extract the code blocks more easily by iterating over the AST instead of having to parse the whole markdown string multiple times.","status":200,"tokens":[0,372],"elapsed":3.308364434,"_type":"aimessage"}]
