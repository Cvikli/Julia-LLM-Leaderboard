[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution:\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    blocks = split(md, \"\\n\") |> String  # Split lines into an array of strings\n    codeblocks = filter(b -> startswith(b, \"`\"), blocks)  # Filter out non-code blocks\n    codes = map(b -> b[3:end-2], codeblocks)  # Remove code fences\n    joined_codes = join(codes, \"\\n\")  # Join the codes together with a newline\n    return joined_codes\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the markdown into blocks (`\\n` acts as a block separator), then filtering out non-codeblocks (those starting with `\"`). It then removes the code fences and joins everything into one string. Note that this solution assumes the backticks (`` ` ``) act as code fences, which is standard in markdown syntax but might not work if other markdown parsers are used or different conventions are used for code block delimiters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,243],"elapsed":2.136503641,"_type":"aimessage"}]
