[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a basic way to solve this task using Julia's Markdown parsing capabilities:\n\n```julia\nusing Documenter, Base64\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    result = \"\"\n    \n    in_codeblock = false\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_codeblock = true\n        elseif in_codeblock && endswith(line, \"```\")\n            in_codeblock = false\n        elseif in_codeblock\n            result *= strip(line[3:end-3]) * \"\\n\" # strip off code fences\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\nThis function checks each line of the markdown document. If a line starts with \"```julia\", it sets in_codeblock to true, and if the current line ends with \"```\", it sets in_codeblock back to false. \nIf it is currently inside a code block, it strips off the start and end of the line (3 characters from each side) to remove the fences and appends the resulting string to result, followed by a newline character. At the end, this function returns the combined code as a String.","status":200,"tokens":[0,292],"elapsed":2.578062765,"_type":"aimessage"}]
