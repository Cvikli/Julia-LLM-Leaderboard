[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    code_blocks = []\n    \n    # Extract code blocks from the markdown document\n    for block in eachmatch(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, seed=Regex(\"```julia\\n\"))\n        code_blocks = [code_blocks; split(strip(block.captures[1]), '\\n')]\n    end\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline \n    result = join([replace(block, \"`\" => \"\") for block in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\nIn this solution we make use of `Markdown.jl`, which is a pure Julia library that parses markdown documents and provides functions to extract and manipulate them. The regular expression `\"```julia(.+?)```\"` matches all code blocks in the markdown document, capturing everything inside the triple backticks as `captures[1]`.\n\nNote: This function does not handle escaped characters within a code block or multi-line code blocks, it simply assumes that every new line within the code block is a separate command. If you need to handle these more complex cases, you would have to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,315],"elapsed":2.743566416,"_type":"aimessage"}]
