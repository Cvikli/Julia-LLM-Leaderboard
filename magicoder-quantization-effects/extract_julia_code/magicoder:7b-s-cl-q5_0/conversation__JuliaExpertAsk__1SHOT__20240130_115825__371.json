Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    code_blocks = String[]\n    inside_code_fence = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\") || startswith(line, \"```python\")\n            inside_code_fence = true\n            start_index = indexin(\"`\", line)[1] + 2 # Index of the opening ` after '``'\n        elseif inside_code_fence && endswith(line, \"```\")\n            code_blocks = push!(code_blocks, line[start_index:end-3])\n            inside_code_fence = false\n        elseif inside_code_fence\n            if !isempty(code_blocks)\n                last_line = pop!(code_blocks)\n                code_blocks = push!(code_blocks, last_line * \"\\n\" * line[start_index:end])\n            else\n                code_blocks = push!(code_blocks, line[start_index:end])\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    if length(code_blocks) > 1\n        return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    elseif !isempty(code_blocks)\n        return code_blocks[1]\n    else\n        return \"\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first splitting the input markdown string into lines. Then it iterates over each line of the markdown, and whenever it encounters a line that starts with '```' (which denotes the start of a code block), it sets `inside_code_fence` to true and calculates the index of the opening '`' after '``' as `start_index`.\nIf it encounters another line starting with '```' while inside a code fence, it stops collecting lines for that block and starts collecting lines for the next one. If it finds a line that is not starting with '```' but is still inside a code fence (i.e., after the end of the last code block), it appends this line to the last collected block.\nFinally, if there are multiple code blocks or just a single one, they are concatenated together with newline characters in between and returned. If no code blocks were found at all, an empty string is returned. \nPlease note that this function does not handle the case of a line starting with '```' but not being the start of a block (e.g., '```some text').","status":200,"tokens":[0,594],"elapsed":5.191709762,"_type":"aimessage"}]
