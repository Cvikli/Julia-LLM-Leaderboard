[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise.

Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can do it in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regular expression for finding code blocks\n    reg = r\"^```.*?```$\"mg   # find all fenced code blocks\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(reg, md))  # eachmatch returns Matches\n\n    # Process code blocks\n    processed_code = \"\"\n    for block in code_blocks\n        code = block.match[3:end-3]   # remove ``` from the code\n        if !isempty(processed_code)\n            processed_code *= \"\\n\"  # Add newline between blocks\n        end\n        processed_code *= code\n    end\n\n    return processed_code\nend\n```\nThis function works by using a regular expression to match all the fenced code blocks in the markdown document. `eachmatch` is then used to iterate over each matching block, which is processed and added to the result string. The result string is returned as the final output.\n\nNote that this does not include any parsing of the Julia language, just simply extracting the raw text from the code blocks. If you want to execute or parse the code, additional steps would be required.","status":200,"tokens":[0,285],"elapsed":2.459694338,"_type":"aimessage"}]
