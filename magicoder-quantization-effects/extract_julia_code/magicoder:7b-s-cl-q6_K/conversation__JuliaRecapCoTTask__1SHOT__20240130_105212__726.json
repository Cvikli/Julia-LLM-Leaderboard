[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you can extract the Julia code from the markdown document using regular expressions. Please note that this solution assumes that the input string has already been sanitized to remove any HTML or other potentially malicious content:\n\n```julia\nimport REGEXP\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks\n    blocks = matchall(REGEXP.rx\"(?s)(?<=^```)(.*?)(?=``$)\", md);\n\n    # Join the blocks together with a newline and remove code fences\n    code = join([block[2:end-1] for block in blocks], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all instances of code blocks delimited by ``` and then joins them into a single string, removing the ``` markers.\n\nIf you're using this solution within a larger program, be sure that REGEXP is imported correctly. For example:\n\n```julia\nimport Base.Regex\n```\nThis code snippet uses regular expressions to search for the markdown code blocks. The \"?s\" inside the regex means that \".\" should also match new lines. This allows it to capture multi-line code blocks as well.\n\nThe function `matchall` is a helper function used here to find all matches in a string. It returns an array of strings where each string is one match. \n\nNote: Make sure to replace `REGEXP.rx\"....\"` with your actual regex string if you are using REGEXP package or any other package for regex processing.","status":200,"tokens":[0,362],"elapsed":3.607864212,"_type":"aimessage"}]
