[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is a Python function to extract Julia code from markdown:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    pattern = r'```(.*?)```'\n    matches = re.findall(pattern, md, re.DOTALL)\n    return '\\n'.join([match for match in matches if 'julia' in match.lower()])\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all code blocks in the markdown document (denoted by ```...```). It then checks if \"julia\" is present (case-insensitive) and only includes those that contain julia. The .*? denotes a non-greedy match, so it will stop as soon as possible to match more of your pattern.\n\nNote: This function assumes that the markdown file uses fenced code blocks (```...```) for Julia code. If you have different formatting or need to handle different languages, you might need to modify this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,219],"elapsed":2.171488368,"_type":"aimessage"}]
