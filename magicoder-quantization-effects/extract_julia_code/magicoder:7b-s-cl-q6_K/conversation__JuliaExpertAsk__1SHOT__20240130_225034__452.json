Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem using regular expressions in Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```julia(.+?)```', md, re.DOTALL)\n    return '\\n'.join(code_blocks)\n```\n\nThis function uses the `re` module to find all occurrences of code blocks in your markdown document that use the 'julia' language. The `re.DOTALL` flag makes `.` match any character, including a newline. It then returns these blocks joined together with newlines. \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the provided markdown document is well-formed and does not contain nested code fences. If your documents can have nested code fences, you would need to use a more complex regular expression or a parser for the Markdown language.","status":200,"tokens":[0,206],"elapsed":1.928273085,"_type":"aimessage"}]
