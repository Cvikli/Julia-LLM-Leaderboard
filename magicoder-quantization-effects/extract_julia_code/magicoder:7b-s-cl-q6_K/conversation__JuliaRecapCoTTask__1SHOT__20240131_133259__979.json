[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regex\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    code_blocks = mapreduce((m)->replace(m.captures[1], \"`\" => \"\"), *, matches)\n\n    return code_blocks\nend\n```\n\nThe regular expression `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```` is used to find all the Julia code blocks in the markdown document. The `.*?` part of the regex means \"match any character (.) any number of times, but as few times as possible\" which is useful when we have multiple backticks in a row.\n\nThe `replace(m.captures[1], \"`\" => \"\")` function removes the code fences from the captured code block. This assumes that there are no more than two backticks (```) in a code block, and that they are not nested. If this is not the case you might need to adjust the regular expression or the replacement accordingly.\n\nThe `mapreduce` function applies the replace function to each match and then joins them together with a newline character.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that there's always a newline after the last line of code in every block, which is common but not strictly necessary for Julia code blocks. If there might be no newline at the end of the last line of code you would need to add some logic to handle this case.","status":200,"tokens":[0,370],"elapsed":3.638013579,"_type":"aimessage"}]
