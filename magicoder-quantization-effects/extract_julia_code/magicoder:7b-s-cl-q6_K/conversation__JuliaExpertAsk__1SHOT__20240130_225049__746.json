Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks\n    codeblocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks\n    joined_code = join([replace(m.captures[1], \"`\" => \"\") for m in codeblocks], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nThis function works by using regular expressions to find all occurrences of Julia language code blocks in the markdown document. It then removes the code fences and joins the code together with a newline character. \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the code blocks are correctly formatted as per the markdown syntax (i.e., they start and end with three backticks (```), followed by \"julia\" on the line after the first set of backticks). If your markdown documents can have different formatting, you would need to adjust this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,253],"elapsed":2.403799158,"_type":"aimessage"}]
