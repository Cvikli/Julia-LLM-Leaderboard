[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Use regular expressions to match the Julia code blocks\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    code_blocks = [replace(m.captures[1], \"\\n\" => \" \") for m in matches]\n    joined_code = join([strip(c) for c in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by using the `eachmatch` function from the Base.Regex module, which finds all matches of a regular expression in a string. The pattern `\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\" is used to match code blocks that start and end with \"```julia\". Inside the parentheses, `.*?` is used to match any character (except for a newline), making it non-greedy so it stops at the first closing fence.\n\nThe extracted matches are then mapped to replace newlines with spaces using `replace(m.captures[1], \"\\n\" => \" \")`, and stripped of leading/trailing whitespace with `strip`. The resulting strings are joined together with a newline character (\"\\n\") in between, forming the final output.","status":200,"tokens":[0,308],"elapsed":2.964394484,"_type":"aimessage"}]
