It extracts the content inside ```julia```. The content is further processed to remove newline characters using `replace` method with \"\\n\" => \"\". The extracted code blocks are then joined together with a newline character using `join` function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,245],"elapsed":2.390047315,"_type":"aimessage"}]
