[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can create such function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    blocks = []\n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        if startswith(line, '```' )\n            push!(blocks, \"\")  # add a new block\n        elseif length(blocks) > 0 && endswith(line, \"```\")\n            break  # remove the last line if it is only ` ``` `\n        elseif length(blocks) > 0 && startswith(line, '`' )\n            continue    # skip lines that are part of code fences\n        elseif length(blocks) == 0 && !startswith(line, '```' )\n            continue    # ignore non-code lines if no block has started yet\n        else\n            push!(blocks[end], line[4:end-3])   # append the content to the current block\n        end\n    end\n    \n    join([join(block, \"\\n\") for block in blocks], \"\\n\\n\")  # return all blocks joined with newlines\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by looping over each line of the markdown document. When it encounters a fenced code block (` ``` `), it starts collecting lines until another one is encountered. It also removes any indentation or leading/trailing whitespace from collected lines. \n\nThe `Markdown` package is used to parse and analyze markdown documents in Julia. If this package isn't installed, you can add it with the command `Pkg.add(\"Markdown\")`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,365],"elapsed":3.656888027,"_type":"aimessage"}]
