[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can write this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    code = reduce((a, b) -> a * \"\\n\" * b.captures[1], map(x -> x.match, code_blocks), init=\"\")\n    \n    return code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all the Julia language code blocks in the markdown document. It then removes the fences from each block and joins them together with a newline character. The `reduce` function is used to concatenate all of the code blocks into one string.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no nested code blocks, i.e., it does not handle cases where a code block contains another code block. If your markdown document can contain nested code blocks, you would need to modify this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,259],"elapsed":2.51604572,"_type":"aimessage"}]
