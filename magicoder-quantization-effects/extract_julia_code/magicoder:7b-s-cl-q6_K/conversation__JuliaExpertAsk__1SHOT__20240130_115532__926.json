Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of the function you described in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regular expression to match code blocks\n    re = r\"```julia(?:\\n|.)*?```\"s\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(re, md)) \n    code_blocks = map(m -> strip(m.captures[1]), matches)  # Extract and remove code fences\n\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")   # Join the code blocks together with a newline\nend\n```\nThe regular expression used (`r\"```julia(?:\\n|.)*?```\"s`) matches any text between three backticks (i.e., `...` in markdown) followed by \"julia\". The ? after * makes the quantifier non-greedy, so it will match the shortest possible string of characters that still meet the pattern.","status":200,"tokens":[0,217],"elapsed":2.118454733,"_type":"aimessage"}]
