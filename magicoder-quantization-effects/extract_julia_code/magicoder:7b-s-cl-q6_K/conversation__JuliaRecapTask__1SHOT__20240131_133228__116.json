[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this task using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = split(md, \"```\")\n    cleaned_blocks = [replace(block, r\"^`| `$\" => \"\") for block in code_blocks]\n    joined_blocks = join([block for block in cleaned_blocks if startswith(block, \"julia\")], \"\\n\\n\")\n    return joined_blocks\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the markdown string into an array of code blocks using the `split` function. Then it goes through each element in this array and removes the backticks that delimit code fences using a regular expression (`r\"^`| `$\"`). Finally, it joins all the cleaned up code blocks together with newline characters between them.\n\nThis function assumes that all Julia code blocks start with '```julia' as a comment to distinguish it from other languages. If there are multiple code blocks, this function will join them together with a newline character in between. \n\nRemember this is a very basic solution and might not work perfectly for every situation (like when the markdown uses indented code blocks or if the language specified after '``` ' differs from 'julia'). For more complex scenarios, you would need to use a proper Markdown parser.","status":200,"tokens":[0,312],"elapsed":3.055729909,"_type":"aimessage"}]
