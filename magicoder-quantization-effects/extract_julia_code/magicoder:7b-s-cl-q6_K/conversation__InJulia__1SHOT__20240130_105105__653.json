Here is an example of how you can implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing REPL.REPLCompletions\nimport Base.markdown\nimport Documenter.Utilities: mdparse_code, mdparse_raw\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    codeblocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\", md)) # collect all julia code blocks\n\n    if isempty(codeblocks)\n        return \"\"  # return empty string if no code blocks found\n    end\n\n    joined_code = reduce((x, y)-> x * \"\\n\" * y.captures[1], codeblocks) # join the code blocks together with a newline\n\n    return joined_code # return the extracted and joined Julia code\nend\n```\n\nThis function `extract_julia_code` takes a markdown document as a string, finds all julia language code blocks in it using regular expressions, joins them together with a newline character, removes the backticks (`) surrounding the code, and finally returns the resulting string of Julia code. If there are no code blocks found, an empty string is returned.\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes that each markdown document has been sanitized to remove any HTML tags or special characters. It does not perform error checking on the input data.","status":200,"tokens":[0,317],"elapsed":3.082376532,"_type":"aimessage"}]
