[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function to solve this problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code = \"\"\n    in_block = false\n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_block = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && in_block\n            in_block = false\n            continue\n        end\n        if in_block\n            code *= line[4:end-1] * \"\\n\"  # remove the ``` and newline at the end of each line\n        end\n    end\n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function reads the markdown document line by line, checks for code blocks (````julia`) and skips them. When it finds a closing code block (```), it stops reading the file. It then joins all the lines of Julia code together with newline characters.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is only one code block in your markdown document, and that each line of code is indented by at least 4 spaces (which is typical for markdown code blocks). If your markdown has multiple code blocks or different indentation requirements, you may need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,285],"elapsed":2.776817155,"_type":"aimessage"}]
