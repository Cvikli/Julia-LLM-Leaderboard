[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise.

Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is an implementation of the above-mentioned problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks in markdown document `md`\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    if isempty(matches) # No julia code blocks found\n        return \"\"\n    end\n    \n    # Extract the content of each code block and join them together with a newline.\n    code_blocks = join([match[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\\n\")\n    # Remove code fences from the code blocks\n    cleaned_code = replace(code_blocks, r\"```\" => \"\")\n    \n    return cleaned_code\nend\n```\nThis function takes a string `md` which represents markdown document. It finds all code blocks in markdown and joins them together with newline. The join operation is performed only if there are multiple julia code blocks present otherwise it returns the single code block as it is. \n\nThe cleaned_code variable removes backticks (`) from the extracted code by using `replace` function, which replaces all occurrences of a specified character with another one. In this case, we replace ``` with nothing (i.e., remove).","status":200,"tokens":[0,298],"elapsed":2.918233913,"_type":"aimessage"}]
