It then extracts the actual code within these blocks and joins them together with a newline character. \n\nThe `collect.(eachmatch(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, seed=1))` part is where the magic happens: it matches all occurrences of strings that start and end with three backticks (```), followed by \"julia\" (case-insensitive due to `r\"...\") and captures everything in between. \n\nThe result is a Vector{SubString{String}} where each element is the code inside one of the found code blocks. The `[occurrences[2] for occurrences in codeblocks]` part then extracts this captured code from each occurrence. \n\nFinally, `join([occurrences[2] for occurrences in codeblocks], \"\\n\")` combines all these codes into a single string, separated by newline characters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,349],"elapsed":3.347468022,"_type":"aimessage"}]
