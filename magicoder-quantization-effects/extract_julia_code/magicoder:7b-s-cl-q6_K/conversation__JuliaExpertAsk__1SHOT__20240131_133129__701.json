[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise.

Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of your request:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    codeblocks = findall(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, collect=true)\n    \n    if isempty(codeblocks)\n        return \"\"\n    end\n    \n    # Remove the code fences and join all code blocks together with a newline\n    code = reduce((x, y)-> x * \"\\n\" * y, map(x -> replace(x[1], r\"```julia\\n\" => \"\"), codeblocks))\n    \n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `findall` function to find all occurrences of a Julia code block in the markdown document. It collects these into an array of matches, where each match is a tuple containing the matched string and its position in the original string. The regular expression used here (`r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n````) looks for the specific pattern of a Julia code block: three backticks followed by \"julia\" on the next line, then any characters (`.*?` is a non-greedy match so it won't include all matches) until another set of three backticks.\n\nThe `map` function applies the `replace` function to each tuple in the array, replacing the code fences with an empty string (\"\"). The `reduce` function then joins all the resulting strings together with a newline. If there are no matches, it returns an empty string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,356],"elapsed":3.413002007,"_type":"aimessage"}]
