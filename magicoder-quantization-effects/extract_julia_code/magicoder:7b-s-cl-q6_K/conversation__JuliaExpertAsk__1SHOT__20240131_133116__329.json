Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    code_blocks = collect.(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=Vector{Substring}())...)\n\n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = join([replace(block, \"`\" => \"\") for block in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all occurrences of Julia code blocks in the markdown document. It then removes the surrounding backticks and joins them together with newline characters. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the input `md` is a String containing the markdown document, and it returns a String containing all Julia code blocks joined together with newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,217],"elapsed":2.068299362,"_type":"aimessage"}]
