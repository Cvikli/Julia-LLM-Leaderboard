The final result is returned as a string. \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the input markdown document `md` contains only one type of code block (either Julia or not). If there are multiple types of code blocks in your document, you may need to adjust the regex pattern accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,399],"elapsed":3.916796267,"_type":"aimessage"}]
