Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of your request in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regex\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    # Extract the content of each match and join them together with a newline\n    return join([match[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all code blocks. The `eachmatch` function returns an iterator over all matches, and we collect those into an array using the `collect` function. Each match is a NamedTuple with fields `:start`, `:input`, `:match`, and `:offset`. We are interested in the content of each block, which is stored in the field `:input`.\n\nThe code blocks are separated by three backticks (```), followed by \"julia\" (to identify Julia code) and a newline. The `.*?` part makes the regex non-greedy, so it will match as few characters as possible between the start and end of the pattern. This ensures that multiple consecutive code blocks are correctly identified.\n\nThe function then joins all the code blocks together with a newline character (`\\n`), using the `join` function.","status":200,"tokens":[118,293],"elapsed":2.828108325,"_type":"aimessage"}]
