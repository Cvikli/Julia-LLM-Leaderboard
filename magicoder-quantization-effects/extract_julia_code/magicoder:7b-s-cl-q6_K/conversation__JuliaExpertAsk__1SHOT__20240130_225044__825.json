Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution for your problem:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # Find all code blocks using regular expressions\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```(.*?)```', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks with newline\n    joined_code = '\\n'.join([re.sub(r'```', '', block) for block in code_blocks])\n    \n    return joined_code\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all code blocks in the markdown document. It then removes the code fences from each block and joins them together with newline characters. The `re.DOTALL` flag is used to make `.*` match any character, including newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,182],"elapsed":1.728361649,"_type":"aimessage"}]
