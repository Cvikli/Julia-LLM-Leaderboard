Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Python function for your task:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown\n    blocks = re.findall(r'```(.*?)```', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline character\n    joined_blocks = '\\n'.join(blocks)\n    \n    return joined_blocks\n```\n\nThis function uses Python's built-in `re` module to find all occurrences of ``` in your markdown text, and then joins them together into one string.\n\nPlease note that this is a very basic implementation and might not cover all edge cases (e.g. if there are nested code fences or escaped backticks within the code). For more complex situations you may want to use a proper Markdown parser/library.","status":200,"tokens":[0,201],"elapsed":1.966437997,"_type":"aimessage"}]
