[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String.

This pattern matches a code block that starts with \"```julia\" and ends with \"```\", capturing everything in between. It then joins these blocks together using the `join` function, replacing any remaining code fences with nothing.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no nested code blocks (i.e., it does not handle cases where a code block is inside another code block). If your markdown document can have nested code blocks, you would need to adjust the regular expression pattern and/or logic in this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,288],"elapsed":2.740704322,"_type":"aimessage"}]
