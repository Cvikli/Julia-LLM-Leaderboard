Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regex pattern\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    if isempty(matches)\n        return \"\"  # Return empty string if no code blocks found\n    end\n\n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    code_blocks = mapreduce((m -> m.match[2]), *, matches; init=\"\")\n    \n    return replace(code_blocks, \"\\n\" => \"\\n\\n\")  # Replace newlines in each block with double newlines\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression to find all code blocks in the markdown document. It then removes the code fences and joins the code blocks together with a newline. If no code blocks are found, it returns an empty string.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is only one language specified after ```` (for example, ` ```julia`). If you have other languages or additional options in your code blocks, you may need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,277],"elapsed":2.633556382,"_type":"aimessage"}]
