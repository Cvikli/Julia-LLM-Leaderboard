It joins these contents together with a newline character to form a single string of Julia code. The regular expression \\s*\\n\\s* is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace that may have been introduced by the parsing process.\n\nPlease note: \n- BeautifulSoup is not a native Python library and you need to install it (`pip install beautifulsoup4`) before using this code.\n- This function assumes there are no other tags within the <code> tags other than Julia language code. If such cases exist, the function may need to be adjusted accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,333],"elapsed":3.230785566,"_type":"aimessage"}]
