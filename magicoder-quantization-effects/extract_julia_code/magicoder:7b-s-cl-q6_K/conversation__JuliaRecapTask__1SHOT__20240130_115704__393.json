[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

This function uses regular expressions to extract code blocks from the markdown document and then removes the code fences (```` or ```) and joins them together into a single string.\n\n```Julia\nusing Dates: DateFormat, dateformat\"Y-m-dTH:M:S\"\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regex patterns to match markdown code block\n    regex = r\"```julia(.*?)```\"ms \n    \n    # Find all matches and store them in an array of strings\n    blocks = [match.captures[1] for match in eachmatch(regex, md)]\n\n    # Join the code blocks together with newline character \"\\n\"\n    joined_code = join([strip(block) * \"\\n\" for block in blocks], \"\")\n\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nNote: This function assumes that all Julia code is indented. If your markdown document does not include indented Julia code, you'll need to adjust the regular expression to match those patterns instead. Also, this function returns a string without the newline characters at the end of each block, as required in the question.\n\nThis function will return all the code blocks in one single string, which can be run in Julia with `eval` function or written into a file for further processing if necessary.","status":200,"tokens":[0,312],"elapsed":3.112533516,"_type":"aimessage"}]
