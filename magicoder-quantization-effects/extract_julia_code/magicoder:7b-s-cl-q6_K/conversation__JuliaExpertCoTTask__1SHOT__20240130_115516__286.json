After that, join them with a newline character. \n\nHere is a solution:\n\n```julia\nusing MD\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    blocks = MD.parse(md, :Julia) |> MD.Blocks |> collect\n    code_blocks = [b.content for b in blocks if isa(b, MD.Code)] \n    code_joined = join([\"\\n\" * b.code for b in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return code_joined\nend\n```\n\nThe `MD` package is not included by default in Julia's standard library, so you may need to add it using Pkg.add(\"MD\").\nAfterward, you can test the function as below: \n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\"\n\n@show extract_julia_code(md)\n```\nThe output should be \"println(\\\"hello world\\\")\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,286],"elapsed":2.853243862,"_type":"aimessage"}]
