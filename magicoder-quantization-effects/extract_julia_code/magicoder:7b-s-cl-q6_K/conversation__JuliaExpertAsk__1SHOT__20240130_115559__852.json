Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    blocks = []\n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        block = \"\"\n        if occursin(\"```julia\", line)  # Start of a new code block.\n            while true\n                block *= readuntil!(IOBuffer(line), '\\n')\n                if occursin(\"```\", block)\n                    push!(blocks, chomp(block))\n                    break\n                elseif eof(line)  # End of markdown document reached.\n                    error(\"Unclosed code block at end of Markdown.\")\n                end\n                line = read(IOBuffer(readuntil!(IOBuffer(line), '\\n')))\n            end\n        elseif !isempty(blocks) && occursin(\"```\", line)  # End of the last code block.\n            push!(blocks, chomp(block))\n            break\n        end\n    end\n    return join(blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function works by reading through each line in the markdown string. If a line contains a code fence for Julia (````julia`), it starts reading lines into `block` until it encounters another code fence or reaches EOF (the end of the Markdown document). If there's no closing code block at the end of the document, it throws an error.\n\nThis function assumes that all Julia code blocks in a markdown document are properly closed and doesn't handle nested code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[0,369],"elapsed":3.579956898,"_type":"aimessage"}]
