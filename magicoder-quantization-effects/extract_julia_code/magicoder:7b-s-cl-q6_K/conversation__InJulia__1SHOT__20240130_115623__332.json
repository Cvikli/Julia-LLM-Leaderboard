It captures everything that follows \"```julia\\n\" and ends before \"\\n```\". Then, it joins all these captured strings with a newline character. The `replace` function is used at the end to remove any leading or trailing newlines from the resulting string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,258],"elapsed":2.508191487,"_type":"aimessage"}]
