[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is an example of how you might start writing this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    code_blocks = []\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Iterate over lines to find code blocks\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            block = \"\"\n            while !startswith(line, \"```\") && !isempty(lines)\n                block *= strip(line*\"\\n\") # Add line to the current block and remove leading/trailing white space. \n                lines = Base.tail(lines)   # Remove the processed line from lines\n                line = popfirst!(lines)    # Get next line\n            end\n            push!(code_blocks, block)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Join all code blocks into one string with a newline between each. \n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by scanning the input `md` line-by-line and checking if a line starts with \"```julia\". If it does, it collects all lines until it encounters another line that starts with \"```\", at which point it knows it's found the end of a code block. It then joins together all the collected code blocks using newline characters and returns the resulting string.\n\nPlease note that this is a very basic implementation of `extract_julia_code`. It could be made more robust by checking for errors, including missing or improperly formatted code blocks, and it also assumes that there's no extra white space in the code blocks which may need to be cleaned up.\n\nIt can be extended with additional features based on requirements as per instructions provided.","status":200,"tokens":[0,399],"elapsed":3.994044108,"_type":"aimessage"}]
