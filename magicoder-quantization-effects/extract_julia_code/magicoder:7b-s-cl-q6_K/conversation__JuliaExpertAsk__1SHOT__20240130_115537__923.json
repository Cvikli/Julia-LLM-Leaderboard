Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regular expression pattern for julia code blocks\n    re = r\"```julia(?:(?!\\n).)*\\n(.*?)(?<=\\n)```\"s\n    \n    # Find all matches in the markdown document\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(re, md))\n\n    # Extract code from each match and join them together with a newline\n    code_blocks = reduce((c1, c2) -> \"$c1\\n$c2\", (m.captures[1] for m in matches))\n    \n    return code_blocks\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `eachmatch` function to find all matching instances of the regular expression in the markdown document and collect these into an array using `collect`. It then reduces this array into a single string by concatenating the captured strings with newline character as separator.","status":200,"tokens":[0,224],"elapsed":2.161192226,"_type":"aimessage"}]
