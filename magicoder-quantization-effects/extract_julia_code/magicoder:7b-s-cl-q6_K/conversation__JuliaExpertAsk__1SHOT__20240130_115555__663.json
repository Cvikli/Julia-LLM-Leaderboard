We look at each line of the document to find the code fences, then if there is a Julia code block in it, we extract the code within that and continue until we encounter another code fence. \n\nWe then join these extracted blocks together with newline characters. Finally, we return this joined string as our result.\n\nPlease note: The provided solution assumes you're using Python and Pymdown-extensions package for markdown conversion. This code also makes the assumption that your markdown document is in the same format as you described (code fenced by three backticks with 'julia' after the third set of backticks). If your markdown document is formatted differently, you may need to modify this solution accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,691],"elapsed":6.796994688,"_type":"aimessage"}]
