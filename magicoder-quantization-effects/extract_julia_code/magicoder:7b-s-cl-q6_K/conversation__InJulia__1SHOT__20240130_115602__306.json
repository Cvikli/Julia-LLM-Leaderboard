[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Split the markdown document into blocks\n    blocks = split(md, \"```\")\n    code = \"\"\n\n    for i=2:length(blocks):2  # Start from the second block (indexing starts at 1 in Julia)\n        # Remove empty blocks\n        if !isempty(blocks[i])\n            code *= blocks[i] * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the input markdown string into a list of substrings, where each substring is a separate \"block\". The indices `2:length(blocks):2` are used to step through the list in steps of 2, skipping over the fenced code blocks (which have two fences `` ``` ``.).\n\nIf an empty block is encountered during iteration (`isempty(blocks[i])`), it's simply ignored. The joined code from all non-empty blocks is then returned as a string. Note that this implementation assumes that there is only one level of indentation in the markdown, i.e., the code fences are not nested.","status":200,"tokens":[88,290],"elapsed":2.832627883,"_type":"aimessage"}]
