Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of your request using Python's `re` module:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```julia\\n(.*?)```', md, re.DOTALL)\n    return '\\n'.join(code_blocks)\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all occurrences of Julia code blocks in the markdown document (`md`). The `re.findall` function returns a list of all matches, and we use the `re.DOTALL` flag to make `.` match any character including newline characters.\n\nThe extracted code is then joined into a single string with newlines between each block using the `join` method.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that Julia code blocks are correctly formatted as per markdown syntax i.e., ```julia\\n(code here)\\n``` and does not include any additional lines or characters before or after the code block. If your markdown document has different formatting, you may need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,243],"elapsed":2.315951287,"_type":"aimessage"}]
