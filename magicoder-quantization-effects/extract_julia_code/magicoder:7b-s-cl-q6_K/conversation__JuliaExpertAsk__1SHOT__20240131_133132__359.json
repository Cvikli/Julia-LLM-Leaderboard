[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise.

Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regex\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, seed=1));\n\n    if isempty(matches)\n        return \"\"  # If no matches found, return an empty string\n    end\n\n    # Concatenate all matched strings\n    code_blocks = reduce((x, y)-> x * \"\\n\" * y.match[1], matches);\n\n    # Remove code fences (backticks) from each line of code\n    cleaned_code = replace.(split(code_blocks, '\\n'), \"`\" => \"\");\n\n    return join(cleaned_code, \"\\n\") * \"\\n\";\nend\n```\nThis function uses regex to find all occurrences of Julia-formatted fenced code blocks in the input string `md`. It then concatenates these code blocks together with newline characters. The backticks (`) are removed from each line of code using the `replace` and `split` functions. Finally, it joins all lines of code into a single string separated by newline characters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,277],"elapsed":2.65525709,"_type":"aimessage"}]
