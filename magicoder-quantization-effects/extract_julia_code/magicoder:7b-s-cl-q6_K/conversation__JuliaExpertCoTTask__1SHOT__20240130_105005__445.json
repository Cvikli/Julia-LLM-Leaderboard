Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution that uses regular expressions to match and extract the Julia code blocks from the markdown document, then removes any leading or trailing whitespace using `strip()`:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # Regex pattern to find julia code fences.\n    pattern = r'```julia(.+?)```' \n    \n    matches = re.findall(pattern, md, re.DOTALL) # DOTALL flag makes . match all characters including newline.\n    \n    if not matches: return \"\" # No matches found, return empty string.\n    \n    # Join the code blocks into one string with newline in between and remove leading/trailing whitespaces.\n    result = \"\\n\".join(match.strip() for match in matches) \n    \n    return result\n```\nThis function works by defining a regular expression that matches any text enclosed within three backticks (`` ` ``), followed by \"julia\" (to only consider Julia code blocks), and then capturing the actual code block. The `.+?` in the pattern is a non-greedy match, meaning it will stop matching as soon as possible, which helps to correctly handle cases where there are multiple code blocks separated by blank lines.\n\nIf no matches were found, an empty string is returned. If matches were found, the function joins them into one string with newline characters between each block, and then removes any leading or trailing whitespace using `strip()`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,329],"elapsed":3.228421855,"_type":"aimessage"}]
