[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    code_blocks = filter(x -> startswith(x, \"```julia\") && endswith(x, \"```\"), split(md, \"\\n\"))[2:end]  # Filter out the code blocks and remove fences\n    code = join([replace(code_block, r\"^```julia\\n|```$\" => \"\") for code_block in code_blocks], \"\\n\")  # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function works by first splitting the markdown document into an array of strings based on newline characters, then filtering out any string that does not start and end with ```julia. This leaves us with only the code blocks in the array. Then we remove the fences from each code block using replace() method and join them together with a newline character.\n\nPlease note: The function assumes that your markdown document is correctly formatted, i.e., all code blocks are properly surrounded by ```julia and ``` characters. If this is not always the case in your input documents, you would need to add additional error checking or cleaning steps to handle these cases appropriately.","status":200,"tokens":[388,290],"elapsed":2.90675536,"_type":"aimessage"}]
