It then concatenates these blocks together (removing any leading or trailing fences), and returns this as a single string.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the input `md` is a valid Markdown document, and that there are no nested code blocks. If you need to handle more complex cases, such as nested code blocks or incorrect markdown syntax, you'll need to modify the regular expression or add additional logic.","status":200,"tokens":[0,309],"elapsed":2.945888671,"_type":"aimessage"}]
