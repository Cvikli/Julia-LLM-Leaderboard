[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here's how you could write such a function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document, ignoring fenced ones (i.e., surrounded by ```)\n    blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```(.*?)```\", md, seed=1)) \n    \n    # Extract code inside each block and remove surrounding whitespace/newlines\n    codes = map(m -> replace(String(m), r\"\\A\\s*\\n|(?<=\\n)\\s*\\Z\" => \"\", m -> strip(m)), blocks)\n\n    # Join all the code blocks together with a newline, if there are multiple\n    return join(codes, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nYou can use this function by calling it on your markdown document as such: `extract_julia_code(\"Your markdown document here\")`. This function will return a string of all the Julia code blocks found in your markdown document, with each block separated by a newline.\n\nPlease note that the function uses regular expressions to match and manipulate the code blocks. The regular expression used here (`\"```(.*?)`````) matches any code block surrounded by ``` (three backticks). The `.*?` inside it makes the match lazy, so it stops at the closest ``` it can find, even if there are multiple in your document. This way, it does not mistake fenced blocks for un-fenced ones.","status":200,"tokens":[0,332],"elapsed":3.257109473,"_type":"aimessage"}]
