[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is an example of how you could implement this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    codeblocks = findall(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=RegexOption.DOTALL)\n    \n    # Remove code fences (i.e., ```julia and ```)\n    codeblocks_without_fences = [replace(codeblock[1], \"`\" => \"\") for codeblock in codeblocks]\n    \n    # Join all the code blocks with a newline\n    joined_code_blocks = join([codeblock for codeblock in codeblocks_without_fences], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return String(joined_code_blocks)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by using regular expressions to match and extract all the Julia language code blocks from the provided markdown document. Each matching code block is a 2-element Array where the first element is the language (which should always be \"julia\") and the second element is the actual code. We then remove the fences from each code block using string replacement (`replace(codeblock[1], \"`\" => \"\")`), combine all the code blocks into one single string separated by newline characters, and return this final string.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes you are passing in a markdown document as a String where the Julia language code blocks are delimited by ```julia\\n and ```. If your format differs, you will need to adjust the regex patterns accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,360],"elapsed":3.480978075,"_type":"aimessage"}]
