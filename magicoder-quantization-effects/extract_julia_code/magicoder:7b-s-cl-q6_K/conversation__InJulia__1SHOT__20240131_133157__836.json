[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    code_blocks = []\n    in_code_block = false\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n            push!(code_blocks, \"\")\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && !in_code_block\n            break\n        end\n        if in_code_block\n            code_blocks[end] *= line[6:end-3] # remove ```julia and ```\n        end\n    end\n    return join([strip(block) for block in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the markdown document into lines, and then iterating over these lines. If it encounters a line starting with \"```julia\", it starts capturing the subsequent lines as a code block until it encounters a line starting with \"```\". It joins all the code blocks together with newline characters and returns this string.\nPlease note that this function assumes that all code blocks are correctly formatted, meaning they start with '```' followed by 'julia' and end with '```' without any spaces in between. If there could be other kinds of fences or other text inside the code block, you would need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,332],"elapsed":3.172620553,"_type":"aimessage"}]
