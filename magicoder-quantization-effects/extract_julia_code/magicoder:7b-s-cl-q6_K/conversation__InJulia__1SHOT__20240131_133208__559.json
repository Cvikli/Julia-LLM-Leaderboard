It captures everything between ```julia\\n and \\n``` (which is the end of a code block) as a separate string, and puts all those strings into an array. Then it joins all elements in this array with newline characters to form the final result.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no other backticks (`` ` ``) in your markdown document. If there might be, you would need a more complex solution to correctly identify code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[0,244],"elapsed":2.333054487,"_type":"aimessage"}]
