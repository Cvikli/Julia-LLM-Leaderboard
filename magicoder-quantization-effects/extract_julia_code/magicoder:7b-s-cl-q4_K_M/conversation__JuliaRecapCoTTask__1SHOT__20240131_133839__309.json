[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"This problem is about parsing markdown files to extract Julia language code blocks, and concatenating them into one string. The given instructions might need specific handling based on their nature. Here's a general solution for the problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    codeblock = []\n    in_codeblock = false\n    str = \"\"\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, '`') && !in_codeblock\n            in_codeblock = true\n        elseif endswith(line, '`') && in_codeblock\n            in_codeblock = false\n        end\n        \n        if in_codeblock \n            codeblock = [codeblock; line[2:end-1]]\n        elseif !isempty(codeblock)\n            str *= join(codeblock, \"\\n\") * \"\\n\"\n            empty!(codeblock)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return str\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we iterate through each line of the markdown document. If a line starts with ` and ends with `, it's considered to be part of a code block. We concatenate these lines into an array `codeblock`. If a line is not in a code block but `codeblock` is not empty, we join all elements of `codeblock` into one string separated by newline characters and add this string to the final result `str`, then clear `codeblock`.\n\nThis function assumes that Julia language code blocks are always well-formed and correctly nested. If not, you might need more complex logic to handle these cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,370],"elapsed":3.031799522,"_type":"aimessage"}]
