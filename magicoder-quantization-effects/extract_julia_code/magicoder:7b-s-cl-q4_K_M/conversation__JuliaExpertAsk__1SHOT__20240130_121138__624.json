Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = Array{String, 1}()\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\") || startswith(line, \"```\")\n            start_fence = line[begin+3:end] == \"julia\" ? true : false  # true if Julia code block starts here\n            if start_fence\n                current_block = \"\"\n                continue_code_blocks = true\n            elseif endswith(line, \"```\") && continue_code_blocks\n                continue_code_blocks = false\n                push!(code_blocks, current_block)  # add the code block to the array\n            elseif continue_code_blocks\n                if line[end-3:end] == \"julia\" && length(line)>4\n                    current_block *= line[begin+1:end-5]*\"\\n\"  # append the new line to current code block\n                else\n                    current_block *= line[begin+1:end]*\"\\n\"\n                end\n            end\n        elseif continue_code_blocks\n            current_block *= line*\"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function goes through each line of the markdown document. If a line starts with ```julia`, then it marks the start of a Julia code block and collects all subsequent lines in that code block until it encounters another ``` or reaches an empty line (which also ends the current code block). All collected code blocks are then joined together and returned as a single string. The function maintains a flag `continue_code_blocks` to check whether it's currently inside a code block or not.\n\nThis implementation assumes that there is no nested ``` in the markdown document and that all Julia code blocks are correctly closed with ``` before another one begins.","status":200,"tokens":[118,482],"elapsed":3.920998886,"_type":"aimessage"}]
