[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem in Julia using regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    code = join([match.captures[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Remove code fences from the code\n    clean_code = replace(code, \"`\" => \"\")\n    \n    return clean_code\nend\n```\nThis function works by first using a regular expression to find all occurrences of Julia code blocks in the markdown document. It then joins these blocks together with a newline and removes any remaining code fences. The result is a string containing all the Julia code from the markdown document, without the code fences. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no nested code blocks or other complications in the input markdown document. If there might be such cases, you would need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,259],"elapsed":2.032646702,"_type":"aimessage"}]
