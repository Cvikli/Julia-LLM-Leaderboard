Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a python solution:\n\n```python\nimport markdown\nfrom markdown import Markdown\nfrom markdown.extensions.codehilite import CodeHiliteExtension, CodeHilite\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    md_parser = Markdown(extensions=[CodeHiliteExtension(guess_lang=False)])\n    \n    # find code blocks in markdown and replace them with placeholders\n    def replace_blocks(match):\n        return f'CODEBLOCK{markdown.util.AtomicString(\"\")}' \n    md = re.sub(r'```julia(.+?)```', replace_blocks, md, flags=re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # parse markdown and find placeholders\n    blocks = md_parser.parse(md)\n    code_blocks = [node for node in blocks if isinstance(node, etree.Element) and 'CODEBLOCK' in node.text]\n    \n    # join the code blocks together\n    joined_code = \"\\n\".join([node.text.strip()[len('CODEBLOCK'):] for node in code_blocks])\n\n    return joined_code\n```\nThis function works by:\n1. Parsing the markdown to find all the code blocks.\n2. Replacing each code block with a placeholder string 'CODEBLOCK' that will not interfere with the markdown parser.\n3. After parsing, it finds and extracts the code from the placeholders and joins them together. \n4. This function assumes that all code blocks are julia code. If you want to extract other languages, change `CodeHiliteExtension(guess_lang=False)` to `True`. It will try to guess the language of the code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,406],"elapsed":3.32554251,"_type":"aimessage"}]
