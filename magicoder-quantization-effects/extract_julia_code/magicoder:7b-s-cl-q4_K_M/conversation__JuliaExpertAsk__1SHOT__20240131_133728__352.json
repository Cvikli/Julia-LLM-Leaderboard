Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could implement this:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all Julia code blocks in the markdown document\n    blocks = matchall(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, 1)\n    \n    # Remove code fences from each block and join them together with a newline\n    result = join([replace(block, r\"^\\n|\\n$\" => \"\", r\"^```julia(.+?)\\n```$\" => \"\") for block in blocks], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return result\nend\n\nfunction matchall(pattern::Regex, s::String, group_number::Int)\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(pattern, s))\n    [match[group_number] for match in matches]\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by using the `matchall` helper function to find all occurrences of the pattern ```julia(.+?)``` in the input string. It then removes code fences from each block and joins them together with a newline.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is only one Julia code block per markdown cell, as it combines all blocks into a single string. If you want to handle multiple code blocks within a single cell, you would need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,300],"elapsed":2.396845083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
