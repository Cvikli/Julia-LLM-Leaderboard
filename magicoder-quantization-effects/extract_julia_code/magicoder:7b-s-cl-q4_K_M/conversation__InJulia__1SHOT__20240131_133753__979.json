[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String.

Here is how you might do it:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    blocks = [strip(join(blocks), '\\n') for blocks in eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seperators=[\"\"]).captures]\n    return join(blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first extracting all code blocks using `eachmatch` to find all occurrences of the regular expression \"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\". The result is a list of captures which are each match. Each capture is a string that matches the pattern, and in this case it's the entire block of code.\n\nThen we strip each block (to remove leading/trailing whitespace) and join them together with newline character (\"\\n\"). \n\nThe `strip` function removes leading and trailing whitespace from the string. The second argument to `join` is an empty string, which means that it will use \"\\n\" as a separator between elements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,256],"elapsed":2.036902063,"_type":"aimessage"}]
