[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, 1))\n    \n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline and remove code fences\n    joined_code = join([replace(block.captures[1], \"`\" => \"\") for block in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all the Julia code blocks in the markdown document and then joins them together with a newline. The `replace` function is used to remove the backticks (`` ` ``) that surround the code blocks.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that there are no nested code fences, and it does not handle any potential errors that might occur if the input markdown document is malformed or contains unexpected content.","status":200,"tokens":[0,236],"elapsed":1.909327628,"_type":"aimessage"}]
