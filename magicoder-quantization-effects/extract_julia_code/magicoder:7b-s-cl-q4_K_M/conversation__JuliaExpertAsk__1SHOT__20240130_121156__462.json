[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise. You're precise and answer only when you're confident in the high quality of your answer.","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Question\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could write the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # find code blocks using regex\n    blocks = matchall(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, 1)\n    \n    # concatenate all blocks together with a newline and remove leading/trailing whitespace\n    combined_code = join([strip(block.match[2]) for block in blocks], \"\\n\\n\")\n    \n    return combined_code\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `matchall` function from the `RegularExpressions` package to find all code blocks in the markdown document, where each code block is represented by a `SubString`. The code within these blocks is then extracted and joined together with a newline character. The `strip` function is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the code.\n\nNote that this function assumes that there's only one language specified in the fences (i.e., it'll work if the language is just 'julia', but won't work for other languages). If you need to support multiple languages, you'd want to update the regex pattern accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,274],"elapsed":2.21243416,"_type":"aimessage"}]
