The `findall()` method is used to find all occurrences of the pattern (the code blocks) and it returns them as a list. We use `re.DOTALL` flag which makes `.` match any character, including newline characters (`\\n`).\n\nIn this case, your example data is `\"\"\"`julia println(\"hello world\") ```\"\"\", and the output of extract_julia_code() would be \"println(\\\"hello world\\\")\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,219],"elapsed":1.767029238,"_type":"aimessage"}]
