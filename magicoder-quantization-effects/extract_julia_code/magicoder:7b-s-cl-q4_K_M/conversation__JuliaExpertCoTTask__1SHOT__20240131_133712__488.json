Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function in Julia that extracts the code from a markdown document with multiple julia blocks:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Split the markdown into lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the extracted julia code\n    result = \"\"\n\n    in_block = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_block = true\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if in_block && endswith(line, \"```\")\n            in_block = false\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_block\n            # Remove the code fences and append to result\n            line = replace(line, r\"^```julia\\n|```$\", \"\")\n            result *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each line of the markdown. If it encounters a line that starts with ```julia, it sets in_block to true and skips the rest of this iteration (with continue). If it encounters a line ending a block (which is any line that ends with ```), it also skips the rest of this iteration. If it is currently in a block (i.e., in_block == true), it removes the fences from the line and appends it to result. Finally, it returns the resulting string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,340],"elapsed":2.740108758,"_type":"aimessage"}]
