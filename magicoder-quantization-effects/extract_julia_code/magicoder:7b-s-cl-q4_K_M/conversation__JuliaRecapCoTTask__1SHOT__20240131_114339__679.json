[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function in Julia to extract all the code blocks from markdown document and join them together:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks \n    blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    code_str = reduce((x, y) -> x * \"\\n\" * y.captures[1], blocks)\n    \n    return code_str\nend\n```\n\nThe function `extract_julia_code` takes one argument: `md`, which is the markdown document as a string. It then uses regular expressions to find all code blocks in the markdown document, where each block starts with ```julia\\n and ends with \\n``` (note that these are three backticks). The function collects all matches into an array of `Match` objects, and for each match it extracts the content between the fences. These contents are then joined together with a newline character.\n\nThis solution assumes that there is exactly one code block per markdown cell, which seems to be the case in your task description. If you have multiple blocks in a single cell, this function will concatenate them without any separation. If you want to add a newline after each block, you can modify the function like so:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks \n    blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    code_str = reduce((x, y) -> x * \"\\n\" * y.captures[1], blocks)\n    \n    return code_str\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,433],"elapsed":3.585086705,"_type":"aimessage"}]
