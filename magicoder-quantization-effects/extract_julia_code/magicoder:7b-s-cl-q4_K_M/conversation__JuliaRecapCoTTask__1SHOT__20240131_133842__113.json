[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, we can use Regular Expressions to extract the content inside the backticks (`` ` ``). \n\nLet's start by defining a function that will return all the code blocks in the markdown document. We'll use the `eachmatch` function from the Base package to find all occurrences of the pattern we are looking for, which is a backtick followed by any number of characters (`.*?`) and then another backtick.\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    matches = eachmatch(r'```(.*?)```', md, seperator=[\"\"]) \n    return join([match.captures[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function will extract all the code blocks from the markdown document and join them together with a newline.\n\nThe `eachmatch` function returns an iterator that yields `RegexMatch` objects, each of which has a property `captures` that is a tuple containing the substrings that were captured by capturing groups in the regular expression. In this case, there's only one group `(.*?)` so we can access it with `match.captures[1]`.\n\nWe use `seperator=[\"\"]` to make sure each match is treated as a separate string instead of being concatenated together. \n\nFinally, the `join` function combines all the strings in an array into one single string separated by newlines. \n\nNote: This solution assumes that there are no nested code blocks within each other. If there were, we would need to adjust our regular expression to account for this.","status":200,"tokens":[0,361],"elapsed":2.960768238,"_type":"aimessage"}]
