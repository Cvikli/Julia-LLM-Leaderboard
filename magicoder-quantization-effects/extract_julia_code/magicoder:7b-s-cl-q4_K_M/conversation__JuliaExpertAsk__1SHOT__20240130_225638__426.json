Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution for this problem:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```(.*?)```', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # Remove code fences from each block and join them together with a newline\n    joined_code = '\\n'.join([re.sub(r'^```\\n|```$', '', block) for block in code_blocks])\n    \n    return joined_code\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all the code blocks in the markdown document and then removes the fences from each block before joining them together with a newline. The `re.DOTALL` flag is used so that `.` matches any character including newlines (`\\n`).\n\nPlease note, this solution assumes that there are no other backticks (`) in your markdown document that might be mistaken for code fences. If you have such cases, a more complex regular expression would be needed to accurately identify the code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[118,249],"elapsed":1.987683124,"_type":"aimessage"}]
