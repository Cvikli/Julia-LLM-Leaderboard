[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is an example of how this function could be implemented in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    blocks = filter(x -> x.language == \"julia\", parse_blocks(md))\n    \n    code_str = join([replace(block.content, r\"^```julia\\n|\\n```$\" => \"\") for block in blocks], \"\\n\")\n\n    return code_str\nend\n\nfunction parse_blocks(md::String)\n    ast = parse_markdown(md)\n    blocks = collect(findall(ast, x -> x isa Github.CodeBlock))\n    return blocks\nend\n```\n\nIn the above function `extract_julia_code`, we first extract all code blocks from the markdown document using the `parse_blocks` function. Then for each block, we remove the language specification and fences surrounding it (if they exist), and finally join all of them together with a newline character.\n\nPlease note that this function uses the `Markdown` package in Julia which parses markdown into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). The AST is then traversed to find all code blocks with the language set as \"julia\". The content within these code blocks are cleaned of the surrounding fences and any leading/trailing newlines, then joined together.\n\nThe `parse_blocks` function also uses the `Markdown` package to parse the markdown document into an AST, then collect all nodes that match the criteria (code blocks with \"julia\" as their language). This function is used by `extract_julia_code` to get a collection of code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[11,385],"elapsed":3.170318116,"_type":"aimessage"}]
