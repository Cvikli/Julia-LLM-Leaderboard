[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise. You're precise and answer only when you're confident in the high quality of your answer.","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Question\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how to implement this in Python using the `markdown` library:\n\n```python\nimport markdown\nfrom markdown import Markdown\nfrom markdown.extensions.codehilite import CodeHiliteExtension\nfrom markdown.util import etree\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup as bs\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    md = Markdown(extensions=[CodeHiliteExtension(guess_lang=False)])\n    soup = bs(markdown.markdown(md), 'html.parser')\n    \n    code_blocks = soup.find_all('pre', class_='codehilite')\n    julia_code = \"\\n\".join([c.text for c in code_blocks])\n\n    return julia_code\n```\nThis function first initializes a Markdown object with the CodeHiliteExtension, which is used to highlight code blocks. Then it parses the markdown string using this `Markdown` instance and converts it into HTML. The resulting HTML is then parsed by BeautifulSoup to find all `<pre>` elements (which are assumed to contain julia code). \n\nFinally, a list comprehension is used to join all the text of these elements together with newline characters (`\\n`). This will give you the Julia source code as a single string.\n\nNote that this function assumes that your markdown document contains exactly one code block for each piece of Julia code and no other kind of HTML or Markdown element. If there are multiple code blocks in different languages, or if there are nested code fences, or if there are any other kinds of elements, you will need to adjust the parsing logic accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,373],"elapsed":3.051197935,"_type":"aimessage"}]
