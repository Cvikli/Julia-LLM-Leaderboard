Finally, it joins the cleaned blocks with a newline and returns the result. Note that this assumes that all code blocks are of the \"julia\" language. If you have other types of code blocks, you'll need to modify the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,214],"elapsed":1.696913463,"_type":"aimessage"}]
