It also strips any leading or trailing whitespace from each line of the code before joining them together. \n\nFor example, if we call `extract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\\nprintln(\"hello world\")\\n```\"\"\")` it will return `\"println(\\\"hello world\\\")\"`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,235],"elapsed":1.890028691,"_type":"aimessage"}]
