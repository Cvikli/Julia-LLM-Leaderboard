[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could implement this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nimport Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    blocks = collect(Markdown.parse(md))\n    codes = String[]\n    for block in blocks\n        if typeof(block) == Markdown.CodeBlock\n            code = join([escape_markdown(line).data for line in block.args[1:end]], \"\\n\")\n            push!(codes, strip(code)) # remove leading/trailing whitespaces and newlines\n        end\n    end\n    join(codes, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `Markdown` package to parse the markdown string into a list of blocks. It then iterates over these blocks and checks if each block is a code block. If it is, we extract the contents as a string and add this to our `codes` array after stripping off leading/trailing whitespaces and newlines using the `strip` function. Finally, we join all the codes in the array into one big string separated by two newline characters (`\"\\n\\n\"`) before returning it.\n\nNote: `escape_markdown(line).data` is used to remove the markdown syntax from code lines so they can be executed as they are written without errors or warnings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,296],"elapsed":2.43106265,"_type":"aimessage"}]
