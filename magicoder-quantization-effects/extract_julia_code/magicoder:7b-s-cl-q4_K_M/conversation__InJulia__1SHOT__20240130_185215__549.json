It then joins these blocks together into a single string with newline separators. Finally, it removes leading and trailing whitespaces and replaces multiple sequential newlines with a single one to achieve the desired format.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the code blocks are not nested. If they were, you would need a more sophisticated parsing mechanism.","status":200,"tokens":[0,267],"elapsed":2.151401581,"_type":"aimessage"}]
