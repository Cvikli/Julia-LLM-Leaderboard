Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is a simple Python solution for your task:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```julia(.+?)```', md, re.DOTALL)  # find all code blocks and match with `re.DOTALL` to include new lines in the match\n    \n    if len(code_blocks) == 0:\n        return \"\"  # Return an empty string if there are no julia code blocks in the markdown file\n        \n    # Remove code fences from each block and join them together with a newline.\n    return \"\\n\".join([re.sub(r'```', '', block) for block in code_blocks])\n```\n\nThe function `extract_julia_code` takes in an argument `md`, which is your markdown document containing Julia language code blocks. It uses the Python standard library's `re` module to find all occurrences of \"````\" (which are the code fence markers) and matches them with `.+?`. The `re.DOTALL` flag makes `.` match any character, even a newline.\n\nThe result is then passed through another list comprehension that removes the remaining \"````\" from each block of code using `re.sub` to return all blocks as a single string, separated by newlines.\n\nPlease note that this function only works correctly if there are no nested or escaped triple backticks within your code blocks. If there are such cases, you would need to use a more complex regular expression, possibly involving lookbehinds or additional logic to handle nested and escaped code fences.","status":200,"tokens":[254,371],"elapsed":4.541346489,"_type":"aimessage"}]
