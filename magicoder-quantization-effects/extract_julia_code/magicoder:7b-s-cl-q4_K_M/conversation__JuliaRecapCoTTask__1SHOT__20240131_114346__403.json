[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    blocks = []\n    for (i, el) in enumerate(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\", md, seperators=[\"\\n\"]))\n        push!(blocks, replace(el.captures[1], \"\\n\" => \"\"))\n    end\n    return join(blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `eachmatch` function from the `Base` module to find all matches of the regular expression in the markdown string. The regular expression pattern `\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\" is used to match the code fences and extract the inner content. \n\nThe captured content (`.captures[1]`) is then stripped of newline characters (`replace(el.captures[1], \"\\n\" => \"\")`). This stripped content is then added into an array `blocks` using the `push!` function. Finally, all elements in `blocks` are joined together with a newline character and returned as a string.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there will be at least one code block in the markdown document. If there is no code block, it will return an empty string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,307],"elapsed":2.52009941,"_type":"aimessage"}]
