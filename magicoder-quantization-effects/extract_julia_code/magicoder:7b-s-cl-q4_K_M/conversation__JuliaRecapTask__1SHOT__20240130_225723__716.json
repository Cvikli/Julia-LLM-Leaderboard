[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can implement this function using regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia(.*?)```\", md, greedy=false))\n    \n    if isempty(matches)\n        return \"\"  # Return empty string if no Julia code blocks found\n    end\n    \n    # Extract the content of each match and join them together with a newline\n    code_blocks = mapreduce(m -> String(m.captures[1]), *, matches)\n    \n    # Remove code fences from the code blocks\n    cleaned_code = replace.(code_blocks, \"`\" => \"\")\n    \n    return join(cleaned_code, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first finding all occurrences of code blocks in the markdown document using a regular expression. It then extracts the content of each match and joins them together with a newline. Finally, it removes the code fences from the extracted code blocks. The result is a single string containing all the Julia code blocks in the markdown document, joined by newlines. \n\nNote that this function assumes that there are no nested code blocks (i.e., backticks inside code blocks). If your markdown can contain nested code blocks, you would need to modify the regular expression to handle those cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,326],"elapsed":2.647407862,"_type":"aimessage"}]
