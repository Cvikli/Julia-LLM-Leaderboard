It then further splits each code block into lines excluding the first and last one (which are fence markers), joins them with newline characters, and finally joins all code blocks with double newlines.\n\nHere is a usage example:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\nSome text...\n\n```julia\nx = 2\ny = 3\nz = x + y\nprintln(z)\n```\n\nMore text...\n\n```julia\na = 4\nb = 5\nc = a + b\nprintln(c)\n```\nSome more text...\n\"\"\"\n\nprint(extract_julia_code(md))\n```\nIn this example, the output would be:\n```\nx = 2\ny = 3\nz = x + y\nprintln(z)\n\na = 4\nb = 5\nc = a + b\nprintln(c)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,343],"elapsed":2.744261214,"_type":"aimessage"}]
