[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    code_blocks = [replace(block.captures[1], \"\\n\" => \"\") for block in blocks]\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Markdown` package to match and extract the Julia code blocks from the input markdown string. It then removes the newline characters from each code block and joins them together with a newline character. \n\nPlease note that this is a simple solution and it assumes that there are no other language code blocks in your markdown document, or that you only want to extract Julia code blocks. If you have other languages or mixed language blocks in your document, you would need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,218],"elapsed":1.759321077,"_type":"aimessage"}]
