[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Find all code blocks.\n    codeblocks = matchall(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, capture=2);\n\n    # Remove code fences and join the blocks together with a newline.\n    return join([replace(code, \"`\" => \"\") for code in codeblocks], \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by using regular expressions to find all occurrences of the pattern \"```julia(.+?)```\", where (.+?) is a capture group that matches any characters (except newline) between the fences. The `matchall` function returns an array of these captured groups, which are then processed further in the function.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the input string `md` contains exactly one code block per line, and that each code block is properly delimited by triple backticks (````...```). If there can be multiple blocks on a single line or if they may be delimited differently, you would need to modify the regular expression and/or the processing logic accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,263],"elapsed":2.119664403,"_type":"aimessage"}]
