It then removes the code fences from each block (i.e., it removes the first and last element of each block). Finally, it joins all the blocks together with a newline character.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\nThis is some text before the code block.\n```julia\na = 1\nb = 2\nc = a + b\n```\nAnd then there's more text after the code block.\n\"\"\"\nprint(extract_julia_code(md))\n```\n\nThis would output:\n\n```julia\na = 1\nb = 2\nc = a + b\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,295],"elapsed":2.345405414,"_type":"aimessage"}]
