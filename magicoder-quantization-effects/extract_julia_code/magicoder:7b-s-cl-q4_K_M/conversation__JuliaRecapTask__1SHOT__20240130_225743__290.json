[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regex\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\", md, seed=1));\n    \n    if isempty(matches)\n        return \"\"\n    end\n\n    # Concatenate the matched strings and remove code fences\n    code_blocks = join([match.captures[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\n    code_blocks = replace(code_blocks, \"`\" => \"\")\n    \n    return code_blocks\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `eachmatch` function to find all occurrences of a Julia code block in the markdown document. It then concatenates these blocks together with newline characters and removes any remaining backticks (code fence markers). If no matches are found, it returns an empty string. \n\nPlease note that this is a very basic implementation and may not work perfectly for all possible inputs. For example, it does not handle cases where the code block is split across multiple lines or includes non-julia syntax. It also assumes that there will be no nested code blocks (i.e., it doesn't account for cases where one block of code is inside another).","status":200,"tokens":[0,306],"elapsed":2.481763331,"_type":"aimessage"}]
