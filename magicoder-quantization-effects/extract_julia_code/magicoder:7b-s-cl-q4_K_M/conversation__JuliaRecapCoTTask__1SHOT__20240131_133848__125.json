[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task you need to:\n- Extract all code blocks from markdown document using regular expression.\n- Remove the triple backticks (code fences) surrounding each block of code.\n- Join these blocks together with a newline character.\n\nHere is a simple function in Julia that does just that:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regular expression to find all code blocks\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\", md, count=0))\n\n    if isempty(code_blocks)\n        return \"\"  # Return an empty string if no code blocks found.\n    elseif length(code_blocks) == 1\n        return first(code_blocks).match[2]  # Return the single code block without surrounding triple backticks.\n    else\n        return join([block.match[2] for block in code_blocks], \"\\n\")  # Join all code blocks with newline character.\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function works by using regular expressions to find all the code blocks, and then concatenating them together into a single string. It also handles the case where there is only one code block or no code blocks at all.\n\nNote: The regular expression assumes that the language specified in the code fence is \"julia\". If other languages are used, you would need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,327],"elapsed":2.67747483,"_type":"aimessage"}]
