It then removes the code fences from each block (replaces \"`\" with \"\") and joins them together with a newline character \"\\n\".\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that all code blocks are correctly formatted as ```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```. If there are any irregularities in your markdown document, you might need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,246],"elapsed":1.924771117,"_type":"aimessage"}]
