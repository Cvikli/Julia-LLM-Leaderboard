[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is your solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, seperators=[\"\\n\"]))\n    \n    # Extract the content of each block and join them together with a newline\n    joined_code = join([String.(split(block.captures[1], '\\n'))...] for block in code_blocks), \"\\n\"\n    \n    return String(joined_code)\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `eachmatch` function to find all occurrences of the pattern \"```julia(.+?)```\". This pattern matches any text between three backticks, capturing whatever is inside the third pair of backticks as a group. The captured groups are then split by newline characters and joined together with a newline.","status":200,"tokens":[0,216],"elapsed":1.734225289,"_type":"aimessage"}]
