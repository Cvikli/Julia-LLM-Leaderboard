[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, capture=2))\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    combined_code = join([replace(block, \"`\" => \"\") for block in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return combined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all occurrences of code blocks in the markdown document. It then removes the code fences and joins together all the code into a single string, with each line separated by a newline character. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the input `md` is a string containing the markdown document. The regular expression used to match code blocks (`r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n````) matches three things:\n- The first backtick (`` ` ``)\n- The string \"julia\"\n- The newline character (\\n)\n- The actual Julia code (.*?)\n- Another newline character (\\n)\n- The final backtick (`` ` ``). \n\nThe capture=2 argument to eachmatch() specifies that we should only return the second match, which is the actual Julia code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,321],"elapsed":2.596455939,"_type":"aimessage"}]
