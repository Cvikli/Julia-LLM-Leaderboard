It then removes leading and trailing whitespace from each code block using the `replace` function with a regex pattern that matches any number of spaces at the beginning or end of a line (`^ *| *$`). Finally, it joins all of the cleaned code blocks together into a single string with newline characters between each block.","status":200,"tokens":[0,289],"elapsed":2.299996566,"_type":"aimessage"}]
