It then removes the fences and joins the code together into a single string, with each line separated by a newline character. \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that there are no nested code blocks or other complications in the input markdown. If you need to handle those cases, more complex regular expressions and/or additional logic would be needed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,210],"elapsed":1.664303069,"_type":"aimessage"}]
