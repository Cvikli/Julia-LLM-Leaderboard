Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here's how you can achieve this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown string\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, greedy=false))\n    \n    # Extract and join the code blocks\n    joined_code = join([match[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Remove code fences (the ```...``` part)\n    cleaned_code = replace(joined_code, \"```\\n\" => \"\")\n    \n    return cleaned_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by using regular expressions to find all code blocks in the markdown string. It then joins these blocks together with a newline character and removes any remaining code fences. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is exactly one level of indentation (i.e., no nested or mixed indentations) within each code block, as otherwise it may not correctly interpret the start and end of each code block.","status":200,"tokens":[0,244],"elapsed":1.943820676,"_type":"aimessage"}]
