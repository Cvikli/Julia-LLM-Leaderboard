[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is one way you can define this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    code_blocks = String[]\n    \n    in_code_block = false\n    current_block = \"\"\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, '```julia')\n            in_code_block = true\n            current_block *= '\\n'\n        elseif in_code_block && endswith(line, \"```\")\n            push!(code_blocks, replace(current_block, \"`\" => \"\"))\n            current_block = \"\"\n            in_code_block = false\n        elseif in_code_block\n            current_block *= line[2:end] * '\\n'  # exclude the leading space in code fences\n        end\n    end\n    \n    join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function splits the markdown document into lines, then scans each line to detect whether it is starting or ending a code block. If it's a start of code block, we simply append a newline before the actual line (to separate from previous content). If it's an end of code block, we join all detected blocks together and push them into `code_blocks` array, then reset everything for next round.\n\nKeep in mind that this function does not take care of syntax errors or unintended behavior if the markdown document contains non-Julia language code blocks or malformed code fences. It simply extracts all Julia code blocks and joins them together with newline between each block.","status":200,"tokens":[0,375],"elapsed":3.091034491,"_type":"aimessage"}]
