It then joins these blocks together into one string, removing any newline characters that may have been included in the original markdown. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the input markdown document is well-formed and does not contain nested or improperly formatted code blocks. If your documents can include such cases, you would need to adjust the regular expression pattern or add additional logic to handle them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,215],"elapsed":1.682700426,"_type":"aimessage"}]
