Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks\n    codeblocks = collect.(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    # Remove code fences (first line and last line)\n    for i in eachindex(codeblocks)\n        codeblocks[i] = join(codeblocks[i][2:end-1], \"\\n\")\n    end\n\n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    return join(codeblocks, \"\\n\\n\");\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all code blocks in the markdown document and then removes the fences (first line and last line) from each block. It also joins these blocks together into one string separated by two newlines (`\"\\n\\n\"`) as required.","status":200,"tokens":[0,211],"elapsed":1.578343827,"_type":"aimessage"}]
