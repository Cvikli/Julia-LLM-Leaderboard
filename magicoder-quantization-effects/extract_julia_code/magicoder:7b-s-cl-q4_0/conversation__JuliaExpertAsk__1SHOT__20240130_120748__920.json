Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you could solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Extract all code blocks\n    blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, 1))\n    \n    # Remove code fences\n    code = join([sub.captures[1] for sub in blocks], \"\\n\")\n\n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function first uses the `eachmatch` function to find all matches of a regular expression in the markdown document, which looks for chunks of text between triple backticks (```). The capturing group `(.*?)` inside the regular expression `.*\\n(.*?)\\n.*` is what gets returned. The `join` operation then concatenates all these strings with newline characters in between to create a single string. \n\nThis function assumes that there are no other triple backticks (```) within any of the code blocks, and that each code block ends with a line break.","status":200,"tokens":[0,231],"elapsed":1.742491982,"_type":"aimessage"}]
