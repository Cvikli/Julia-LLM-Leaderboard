[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks and remove the fences\n    blocks = replace.(collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\", md; flags=re.I)), r\"\\n\" => \"\")\n\n    # Join the blocks together with a newline\n    return join(blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find and extract all code blocks from the markdown document `md`. The regular expression `\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\" captures all text between fenced Julia code blocks (i.e., ```julia). The `collect` function is used to create a list of matches, which are then joined together with newline characters using the `join` function.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that there is only one level of indentation per code block and that each code block ends with a newline character. If your markdown document may contain nested or more complex code fences or other issues, you might need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,256],"elapsed":1.932293642,"_type":"aimessage"}]
