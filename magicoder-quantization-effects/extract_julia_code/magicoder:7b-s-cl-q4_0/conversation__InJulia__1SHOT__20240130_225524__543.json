[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regex\n    blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, 1))\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    code_blocks = mapreduce(*, vcat, [split(block.captures[1], \"\\n\") for block in blocks])\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all the Julia language code blocks in the markdown document. It then removes the fences from each of these code blocks and joins them together with a newline character. The `mapreduce` function is used to apply the `split` function to each block, which splits the block into lines, and then applies the `vcat` function to concatenate all the resulting arrays together. Finally, it uses the `join` function to join all of these lines with a newline character.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that there is only one level of indentation in each code block (i.e., no nested code blocks). If there are multiple levels of indentation, you would need a more complex solution to handle it correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,297],"elapsed":2.19220955,"_type":"aimessage"}]
