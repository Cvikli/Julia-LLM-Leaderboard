[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is one way to solve this problem using the Markdown module in Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\nfrom markdown import markdown\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    pattern = r'```julia\\n(.*?)```'\n    code_blocks = re.findall(pattern, md, re.DOTALL)\n    joined_code = '\\n'.join(code_blocks)\n    cleaned_code = re.sub(r'```', '', joined_code) # remove fences\n    return cleaned_code\n```\nThis function extracts all the Julia code blocks from the markdown document `md` and joins them together with a newline character. It then removes any remaining code fences from the resulting string. The `.*?` in the regular expression is a non-greedy match, which means it will stop matching as soon as possible rather than greedily trying to match as much as possible. This ensures that multiple consecutive Julia blocks are correctly joined together.\n\nRemember to replace `{{instructions}}` with your actual instructions.","status":200,"tokens":[0,243],"elapsed":1.867044716,"_type":"aimessage"}]
