The `.*?` is a non-greedy match (i.e., it will stop matching as soon as possible), and `\\n` matches any newline character.\n\nThe `collect(eachmatch(...))` part collects all of these matches into an array, which we then use to extract the code blocks themselves. The `[...]` syntax is used for list comprehensions in Julia, which is a concise way to create arrays or other collections. \n\nFinally, we join all of the code blocks together with newline characters using `join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")`, and return this string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,280],"elapsed":2.070433414,"_type":"aimessage"}]
