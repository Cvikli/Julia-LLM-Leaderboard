[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    pattern = r\"```julia(?:(?!```).)*```\"s  # regex pattern to match the code block\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(pattern, md))  \n    \n    for i in eachindex(matches)\n        matches[i] = replace(matches[i], \"`\" => \"\") # remove backticks from the matched blocks\n    end\n    return join(matches, \"\\n\")  # join all the code blocks with newline and return as a string\nend\n```\n\nIn this implementation:\n1. We define a regular expression pattern `r\"```julia(?:(?!```).)*```\"s` to match the Julia code block enclosed in three backticks (```julia...``` and ```). This is achieved with non-greedy matching (?:...).*?.\n2. The function `eachmatch` returns an iterator for each match of the pattern in the input string `md`. We collect these into a Vector `matches`.\n3. Next, we replace all occurrences of backticks (`\"`) in the matched code blocks with empty strings using `replace(matches[i], \"`\" => \"\")`. This is done to remove unnecessary backticks from the code.\n4. Finally, we join all the elements of Vector `matches` (the stripped down Julia code) with newline character `\"\\n\"` and return this as a string.\n\nThis function should work fine for most cases. However, if you expect to handle multiple different types of code blocks or very complex markdown structures, it might need adjustments.","status":200,"tokens":[11,380],"elapsed":2.977061148,"_type":"aimessage"}]
