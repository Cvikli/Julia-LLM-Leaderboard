This matches code blocks that start with \"```julia\" and end with \"```\", capturing everything in between. \n\nThe resulting matches are then joined together into a single string, replacing any remaining backticks (`` ` `` ) with an empty string. \n\nIf no code blocks were found (i.e., the input string does not contain any \"```julia\" blocks), the function returns an empty string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,285],"elapsed":2.140483293,"_type":"aimessage"}]
