Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of your request in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks\n    blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, 1))\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks\n    joined_code = join([block[1] for block in blocks], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all occurrences of code blocks in your markdown document. It then removes the code fence lines (```julia\\n and \\n```) from each block, joins them together with a newline character, and returns the result. \n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes that there is only one language specified for each code block (in this case, Julia). If you have blocks of different languages mixed in your document, you would need to modify the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,220],"elapsed":1.626716429,"_type":"aimessage"}]
