[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

The `re.DOTALL` flag is used to make the dot (`.`) match any character including newline. Then it removes code fences and joins the code blocks if there are multiple with a newline.","status":200,"tokens":[254,214],"elapsed":3.268626267,"_type":"aimessage"}]
