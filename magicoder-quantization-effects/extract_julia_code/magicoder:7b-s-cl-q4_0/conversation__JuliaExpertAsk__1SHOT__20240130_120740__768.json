Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is your solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(pattern, md))\n    code_blocks = [match.captures[1] for match in matches]\n    joined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    return String(joined_code)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the regular expression `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s` to find all code blocks in the markdown document. It then removes the code fences (three backticks on either side) and joins all found code blocks with a newline character.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that Julia code is formatted as triple backticks (```julia\\ncode...\\n```): if your document uses different formatting, you will need to adjust the regular expression accordingly. \n\nIf there are no julia code blocks in the `md` string, it returns an empty String.","status":200,"tokens":[0,245],"elapsed":1.853036751,"_type":"aimessage"}]
