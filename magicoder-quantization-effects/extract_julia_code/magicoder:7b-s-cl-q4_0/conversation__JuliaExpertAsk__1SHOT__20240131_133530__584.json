Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could write this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regex\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, 1))\n    \n    # Join the code blocks together and remove newlines\n    code = join(matches; separator=\"\\n\") |> replace(\"\\n\", \"\")\n    \n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function uses a regular expression to find all occurrences of Julia code blocks in the markdown document. It then joins these together with newline characters, and removes any remaining newline characters. The final result is returned as a String.","status":200,"tokens":[118,164],"elapsed":1.253747704,"_type":"aimessage"}]
