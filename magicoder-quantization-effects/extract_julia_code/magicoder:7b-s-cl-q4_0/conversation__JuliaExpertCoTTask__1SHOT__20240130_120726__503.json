[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    blocks = split(md, \"```julia\", keepempty=false)\n    \n    code_blocks = [strip(split(block, \"\\n\")[2]) for block in blocks if length(block)>0]\n    joined_code = join([code for code in code_blocks], \"\\n\\n\")\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function splits the input `md` by every occurrence of '```julia', discarding the empty strings at the ends. Then it loops through all the blocks, removes the first line (which is always \"```julia\"), and joins all the code blocks together with a newline character in between. The result is then returned as a String.\n\nPlease note that if you have multiple ```julia` blocks without any line breaks or spaces in-between, it will treat them as one block. If you want to keep them separate, you'd need more complicated logic.","status":200,"tokens":[0,227],"elapsed":1.729746865,"_type":"aimessage"}]
