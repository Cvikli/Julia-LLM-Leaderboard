[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might write this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Find all code blocks\n    code_blocks = collect.(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join together with a newline\n    joined_code = join([replace(block[1], \"`\" => \"\") for block in code_blocks]; '\\n')\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all the Julia language code blocks in the markdown document. The `eachmatch` function returns an iterator of matches, and we collect these into an array with `collect`. Each match is a tuple containing the full match (which includes the code fences) and the captured group (the actual Julia code). We then replace all occurrences of \"`\" with \"\" to remove the code fences. Finally, we join all the blocks together with a newline character using `join`.\n\nNote that this function assumes that there is only one level of indentation in the markdown file, and that each code block starts on its own line. If your markdown document uses different indentation or other conventions, you may need to adjust this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,289],"elapsed":2.226191777,"_type":"aimessage"}]
