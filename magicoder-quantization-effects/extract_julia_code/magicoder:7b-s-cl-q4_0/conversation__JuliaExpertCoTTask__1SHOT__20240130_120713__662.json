When it encounters a line that contains ```julia (i.e., a start of a code block), it adds an empty string to `code_blocks`. When it encounters a line with ``` at both ends, it removes the ``` and adds the rest to `code_blocks`. Otherwise, it simply adds whatever is in the line to `code_blocks`. Finally, it joins all the elements of `code_blocks` into one string (with newline characters between blocks) and returns this string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,326],"elapsed":2.493066456,"_type":"aimessage"}]
