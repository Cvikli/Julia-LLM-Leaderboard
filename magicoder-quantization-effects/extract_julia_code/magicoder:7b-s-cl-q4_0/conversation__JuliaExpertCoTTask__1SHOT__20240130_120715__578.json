[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Find all code blocks\n    blocks = findall(`r\"\\`\\`\\`julia(.|\\n)*?\\`\\`\\`\", md)\n    \n    for i in eachindex(blocks)\n        # Remove the code fences\n        blocks[i] = replace(blocks[i], \"`\" => \"\")\n    end\n    \n    # Join all the code blocks together with a newline\n    return join(blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all occurrences of Julia-formatted code blocks in the input string. It then removes any remaining backticks (`` ` ``) from these blocks and finally joins them together into a single string with newline characters in between each block. \n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes that there are no nested code fenced blocks, which means it may not work properly if your markdown document contains such structures. Also, it does not account for any language-specific features within Julia code blocks; it only cares about the presence of \"`\" characters. For a more robust solution, you might need to use a proper markdown parser and then extract Julia code blocks from those.","status":200,"tokens":[0,279],"elapsed":2.131081391,"_type":"aimessage"}]
