Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regex\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, 1))\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = join([m.captures[1] for m in code_blocks], \"\\n\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all the Julia language code blocks in the markdown document. It then removes the code fences and joins them together with a newline character.\n\nNote: This assumes that each code block is correctly formatted as ` ```julia(capture) ``` `. If there are multiple code blocks separated by other text, this function will not work properly.","status":200,"tokens":[118,217],"elapsed":1.633324981,"_type":"aimessage"}]
