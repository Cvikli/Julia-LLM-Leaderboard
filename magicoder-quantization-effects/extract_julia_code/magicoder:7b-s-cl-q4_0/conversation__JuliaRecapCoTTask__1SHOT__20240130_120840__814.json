[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function in Julia that does what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Find all code blocks\n    blocks = split(md, \"```julia\")\n    \n    # Remove the '```' at each end of the block\n    trimmed_blocks = [split(block, \"\\n\")[2:end-1] for block in blocks if !isempty(block)]\n\n    # Join all code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = join(join.(trimmed_blocks), \"\\n\\n\");\n\n    return joined_code;\nend\n```\nIn this function, we first split the markdown by '```julia', which is how we identify Julia code blocks. We then remove the first and last lines of each block (which are empty due to the '```' on either side), since they're there just for syntax highlighting in the Markdown editor. The `join` function then joins all of these stripped blocks together with a newline ('\\n') between each, and returns this joined string as our result.\n\nNote: This is assuming that your markdown uses '```julia' to start code blocks, which is common practice in many markdown editors like VS Code or GitHub. If you use something different, you may need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,307],"elapsed":2.390854447,"_type":"aimessage"}]
