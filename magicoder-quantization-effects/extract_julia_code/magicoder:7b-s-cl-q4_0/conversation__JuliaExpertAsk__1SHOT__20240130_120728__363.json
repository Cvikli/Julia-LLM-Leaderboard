Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all markdown code fences\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```(.*?)\\n([^`]*)```\", md, 1))\n\n    # Join the code blocks and remove backticks\n    code = join([m.captures[2] for m in matches], \"\\n\")\n    code = replace(code, \"`\" => \"\")\n    \n    return code\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, `md` is a string representing your markdown document with Julia code blocks. The function will return the concatenation of all code blocks (without any code fences), and each block has had its backticks (``) removed. If there are multiple code blocks in the document, they'll be joined by newline characters (`\\n`). \n\nThis function works by using a regular expression to find all code fence delimiters in your markdown, and then extracting the contents of those delimiters (which should be your Julia code). It then joins all of these extracted codes together without any fences.","status":200,"tokens":[118,257],"elapsed":1.976555533,"_type":"aimessage"}]
