Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all Julia code blocks in markdown\n    codeblocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, 1));\n    \n    # Join the code blocks with a newline\n    joined_code = join([m.captures[1] for m in codeblocks], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to match Julia language code blocks in markdown documents. It searches for code blocks of the form ` ```julia \\n CODE BLOCK \\n ``` `. This will work assuming there are no other markdown elements that use fences with three backticks (```), and that Julia does not interpret these as escape characters. If these assumptions do not hold, the function may need to be adjusted accordingly. \n\nThe function then joins all of the code blocks together using a newline character between each block. Note: The captured `m.captures[1]` is the actual code in the markdown. This function does not return any examples as you requested.","status":200,"tokens":[0,254],"elapsed":1.921788313,"_type":"aimessage"}]
