[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution for the problem using Regular Expressions in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Find all code blocks\n    codeblocks = matchall(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md)\n    \n    # Remove code fences\n    for i in eachindex(codeblocks)\n        codeblocks[i] = replace(codeblocks[i], r\"^```julia\\n|```$\" => \"\")\n    end\n    \n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline and return as string.\n    return join(codeblocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n\nmatchall(pattern::AbstractString, str::AbstractString) = collect(eachmatch(r\"(?=$pattern)\", str))\n```\n\nThis solution first uses `matchall` to find all occurrences of the pattern that matches a block of Julia code. Then it replaces each occurrence of the code fences (```julia\\n and ```$) with an empty string, effectively removing them. Finally, it joins the remaining strings in the array together with a newline character. \n\nIf you want to use this function on your markdown document `md`, call it like so:\n```julia\nextract_julia_code(md)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,297],"elapsed":2.298287272,"_type":"aimessage"}]
