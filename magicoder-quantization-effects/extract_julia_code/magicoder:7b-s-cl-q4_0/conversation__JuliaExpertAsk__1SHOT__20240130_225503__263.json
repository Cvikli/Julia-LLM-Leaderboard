Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple Python solution using regular expressions:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```(.*?)```', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # Remove code fences from each block and join them together with a newline\n    joined_code = '\\n'.join([re.sub(r'^```\\n|```$', '', block) for block in code_blocks])\n    \n    return joined_code\n```\n\nThis function works by first finding all the code blocks in the markdown document using a regular expression that matches ```...```. The `re.DOTALL` flag is used to make `.` match any character, including newline. It then removes the code fences from each block and joins them together with a newline.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no other characters (like comments) within the code blocks that might need to be preserved. If you have such cases, you may need a more complex solution using a proper markdown parser or a language-specific parser for Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[0,260],"elapsed":1.927602772,"_type":"aimessage"}]
