Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    blocks = split(md, \"\\n\\n\")  # Split markdown into code blocks\n    code_blocks = filter!(str -> startswith(str, \"`\"), blocks)  # Filter out non-Julia code blocks\n\n    code = \"\"\n    for block in code_blocks\n        block = replace(block, \"`\" => \"\")  # Remove code fences\n        if !isempty(code)\n            code *= \"\\n\"\n        end\n        code *= block\n    end\n    return code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the markdown document into blocks using two consecutive newline characters as delimiters. It then filters out any blocks that do not start with a backtick, which is the markdown syntax for indicating a code block in Julia language. Finally, it joins all of the remaining code blocks together (if there are multiple) and removes the surrounding code fences using string replacement. The resulting code is returned as a String.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the provided input `md` is already stripped from HTML tags. If it isn't, you may want to strip them before processing the markdown document.","status":200,"tokens":[0,289],"elapsed":2.185238114,"_type":"aimessage"}]
