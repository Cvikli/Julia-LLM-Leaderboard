It then joins these blocks together with newline characters and removes any remaining backticks (`) from the code. If there are no matches, it returns an empty string. \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the provided markdown document is well-formed and contains valid Julia language code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[0,251],"elapsed":1.853611604,"_type":"aimessage"}]
