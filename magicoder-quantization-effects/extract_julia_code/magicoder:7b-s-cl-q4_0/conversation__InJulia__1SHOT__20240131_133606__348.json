The `.*?` part makes it non-greedy, so it will stop matching at the first closing fence. \n- `collect(eachmatch(...))` collects all matches into an array of tuples, where each tuple contains the matched string (the code block) and its index in the original string.\n- `[match[1] for match in code_blocks]` extracts just the matched strings from the tuples.\n- `join(..., \"\\n\")` joins all the strings with a newline character between them. \n\nThe function returns this joined string, which is the code content of all Julia code blocks in the markdown document.","status":200,"tokens":[0,304],"elapsed":2.285037449,"_type":"aimessage"}]
