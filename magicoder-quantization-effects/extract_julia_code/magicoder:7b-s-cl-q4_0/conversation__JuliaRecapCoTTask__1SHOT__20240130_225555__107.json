[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might implement this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, 1))\n    \n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = join([m.captures[1] for m in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Remove code fences (triple backticks)\n    cleaned_code = replace(joined_code, \"`\" => \"\")\n    \n    return cleaned_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression to match the Julia language code blocks in the markdown document. It then joins all of these matched strings together with a newline character, effectively combining them into one string. The `replace` function is used to remove the triple backticks (code fences) from the resulting string.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the input markdown document `md` contains exactly one set of code blocks for each language. If there are multiple sets of code blocks, or if they're not all in Julia, then you may need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,288],"elapsed":2.190895738,"_type":"aimessage"}]
