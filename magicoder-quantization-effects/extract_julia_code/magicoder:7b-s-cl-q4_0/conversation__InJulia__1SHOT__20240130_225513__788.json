It then removes the code fence characters and joins the resulting strings together with a newline character. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the code blocks are correctly formatted as per the markdown standard, i.e., they start with ```julia\\n and end with \\n``` to denote the end of the block. If there is any possibility of incorrect formatting in your input string, you may need to add additional error checking or handling.","status":200,"tokens":[0,248],"elapsed":1.829006108,"_type":"aimessage"}]
