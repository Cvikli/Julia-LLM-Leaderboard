This function should be able to handle cases where there is no code block, one or more than one code blocks, and multiple lines of code within those blocks.\n\nHere's an example implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    md_parsed = parse_md(md)\n    blocks = findall(r\"^```.*?\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md_parsed, 1)\n    code_blocks = map(x -> x[1], blocks) # Extract the code block content\n    joined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    return replace(joined_code, \"`\" => \"\") # Remove the backticks\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by using a regular expression to find all occurrences of a code block in the markdown document. It then maps over these blocks and extracts their contents, removes any backticks from the content, joins them together with newline characters, and finally returns the joined string. \n\nFor example:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\nHere is some code in Julia:\n```julia\na = 10\nb = 20\nc = a + b\n```\nAnd here is another block of code:\n```julia\nd = c * 3\ne = d / 2\n```\n\"\"\"\nprintln(extract_julia_code(md)) # Prints \"a = 10\\nb = 20\\nc = a + b\\nd = c * 3\\ne = d / 2\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,389],"elapsed":2.940787557,"_type":"aimessage"}]
