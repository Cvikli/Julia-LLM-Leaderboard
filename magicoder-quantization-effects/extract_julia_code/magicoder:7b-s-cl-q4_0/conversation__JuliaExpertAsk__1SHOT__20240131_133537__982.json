Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can define this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all markdown code blocks using regular expressions\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    # If no matches found, return an empty string\n    if isempty(matches) \n        return \"\"\n    end\n\n    # Join all code blocks together with a newline and remove the code fences\n    joined_code = join([match[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\n    return replace(joined_code, \"`\" => \"\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all instances of Julia language code blocks within your markdown document. It then joins these together with a newline and removes the code fences (the backticks) using the `replace` function. If no matches are found, it returns an empty string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,220],"elapsed":1.646283932,"_type":"aimessage"}]
