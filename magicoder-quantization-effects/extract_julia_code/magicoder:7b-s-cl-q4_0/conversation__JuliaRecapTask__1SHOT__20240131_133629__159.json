[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem using Julia programming language:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    blocks = replace.(split(md, \"```julia\"), [\"\", \"\\n\"])\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join them together with a newline\n    code = join(blocks[2:end], \"\\n\")\n    return code\nend\n```\n\nThis function splits the markdown document into blocks using `split` function, then removes unnecessary elements by replacing. The second block contains the Julia code. \n\nThe `join` function is used to concatenate all the code blocks with a newline character in between. \n\nThis solution assumes that there are no nested ```...``` code blocks within each other. If you have such cases, you would need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,203],"elapsed":1.554988635,"_type":"aimessage"}]
