[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    code_blocks = String[]\n    in_code_block = false\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n            start_index = findfirst(isequal('`'), line) + 1\n            end_index = findlast(isequal('`'), line)\n            code_block = line[start_index:end_index]\n            push!(code_blocks, code_block)\n        elseif in_code_block && startswith(line, \"```\")\n            in_code_block = false\n        elseif in_code_block\n            push!(code_blocks, line[3:end]) # remove the '    ' prefix\n        end\n    end\n    join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each line of the markdown document. If it encounters a line that starts with ````julia`, it starts recording code blocks until it encounters another line starting with `````. It then joins all recorded code blocks together into one string, removing any leading '    '. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes the markdown document is well-formatted and does not contain nested code fences. If your markdown documents can have nested code fences or other irregularities, you may need to adjust this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,356],"elapsed":2.633266015,"_type":"aimessage"}]
