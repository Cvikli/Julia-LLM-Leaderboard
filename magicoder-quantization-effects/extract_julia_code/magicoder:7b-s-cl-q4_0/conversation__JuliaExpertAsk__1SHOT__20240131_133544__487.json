Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of the problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks\n    code_blocks = eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, 1);\n    \n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = join(map(x -> chomp(x.captures[1]), code_blocks), \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, `eachmatch` is used to find all occurrences of the pattern \"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\" in the markdown document. This pattern matches a block of code that starts with ```julia and ends with ``` which are delimited by newlines. The `.*?` inside the parentheses captures any characters (but as few as possible) between these delimiters, resulting in each match containing the actual code block.\n\nThe `chomp` function is used to remove trailing newline characters from each code block before joining them together with a newline character.\n\nFinally, `join(map(...), \"\\n\")` joins all of the extracted code blocks into one string, with each block separated by a newline.","status":200,"tokens":[0,286],"elapsed":2.149594844,"_type":"aimessage"}]
