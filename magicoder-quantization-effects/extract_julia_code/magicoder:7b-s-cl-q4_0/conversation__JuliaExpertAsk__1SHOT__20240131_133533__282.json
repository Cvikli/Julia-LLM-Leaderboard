Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution using regex:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```julia\\n(.*?)```', md, re.DOTALL)\n    if not code_blocks:\n        return \"\"\n    joined_code = \"\\n\".join(code_blocks)\n    return joined_code\n```\n\nThis function uses the `re` module to find all occurrences of the pattern \"```julia\\n(.*?)```\" in the input string `md`. The `re.DOTALL` flag tells python to include newlines when matching `.`, which is used in the regex to match any character (except a newline).\n\nIf no code blocks are found, an empty string will be returned. Otherwise, all the code blocks will be joined together with a newline (`\\n`).","status":200,"tokens":[0,203],"elapsed":1.516106953,"_type":"aimessage"}]
