It then iterates over each element in the AST, checking if it is a `CodeBlock`. If it is, it concatenates its text (the code block) with a newline character to the `code` variable.\n\nFinally, the function returns the extracted code as a String. Note that this will only work correctly if there are no nested code blocks in your markdown document. If there are, you may want to modify the function to handle those cases appropriately.","status":200,"tokens":[88,281],"elapsed":2.129715178,"_type":"aimessage"}]
