[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In this case, we don't have an example to guide us but we can build on the task description and the special instructions to provide a solution. \n\nAs per your instructions, the function `extract_julia_code` will extract all Julia code blocks from the markdown document using regular expressions.\n\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions: match, eachmatch, MATCH_START, MATCH_END\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Matches a fenced block of julia code\n    pattern = r\"```julia(?:repl)?\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s \n    \n    matches = eachmatch(pattern, md)\n    blocks = join([match.captures[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return blocks\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `RegularExpressions` package to extract code fenced by three backticks (```), and captures everything between them (.*?).  The \"s\" at the end makes the pattern a \"sticky\" regular expression, which means it won't match over multiple lines.\n\nThis solution assumes that all your code blocks are on their own line and preceded by a newline character. If they're inline with other text or not preceded by a newline character you may need to adjust the pattern accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,304],"elapsed":2.504773097,"_type":"aimessage"}]
