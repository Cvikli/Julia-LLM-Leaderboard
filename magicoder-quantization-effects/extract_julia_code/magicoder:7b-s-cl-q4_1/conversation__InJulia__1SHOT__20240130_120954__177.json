It then splits each code block into lines, removes the first (which is empty due to leading newline) and last line (which would be a trailing newline), and finally joins them together.\nPlease note you need to install the `Regex` package if it's not already installed: \n\n```julia\nPkg.add(\"Regex\")\nusing Regex\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,224],"elapsed":1.780023686,"_type":"aimessage"}]
