It then filters out all elements that are not of type `Code`, which are the code blocks in the markdown.\n\nEach `Code` element contains three fields: a `:tag`, indicating the language used, and two `Vector{Substring}`s containing lines of the content. The second field (`content[2]`) is the actual code to be extracted, so we join these together with newlines (`\"\\n\"`).\n\nNote that this function assumes that all code blocks use the julia language. If there are other languages used in the markdown document or if you want to handle multiple languages, you would need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,329],"elapsed":2.628520015,"_type":"aimessage"}]
