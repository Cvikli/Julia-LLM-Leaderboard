[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

We will use this feature along with the built-in `replace` function. Here is how you might do it:\n\n```julia\nusing REPL.REPLCompletions: find_next_completion\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Find all occurrences of code blocks (between ``` and ```)\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seperators=[\"\\n\"]))\n\n    # Remove the newline characters and join them together with a newline character\n    code_blocks = join([replace(m[1], \"\\n\" => \"\") for m in matches], \"\\n\")\n\n    return code_blocks\nend\n```\nNote that this function assumes that there is exactly one set of triple backticks (````) per block. If you have multiple blocks per markdown document, this will need to be adapted slightly to handle them correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,227],"elapsed":1.865917479,"_type":"aimessage"}]
