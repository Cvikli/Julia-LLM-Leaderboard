Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of such a function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all indices where the code fence (backticks ```) start and end\n    starts = findall(\".{3}\\n\", md)\n    ends = findall(\"\\n.{3}\", md)\n\n    # Initialize an empty string for the final extracted code\n    code_str = \"\"\n    \n    # Iterate over all indices pairs\n    for (start, end_) in zip(starts, ends)\n        # Extract the code block and remove the code fences\n        code_block = md[start+3:end_-3]\n        \n        # Join with a newline character if there are multiple blocks\n        if !isempty(code_str) \n            code_str *= \"\\n\"\n        end\n        \n        # Append the new block to the final string\n        code_str *= code_block\n    end\n    \n    return code_str\nend\n```\nThis function uses `findall` to find all instances of three backticks (the markdown code fences), and then extracts the code blocks between these markers. It joins all the code blocks together with newline characters, removing the fence marks in the process. The function returns a string containing the extracted Julia code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,303],"elapsed":2.42106782,"_type":"aimessage"}]
