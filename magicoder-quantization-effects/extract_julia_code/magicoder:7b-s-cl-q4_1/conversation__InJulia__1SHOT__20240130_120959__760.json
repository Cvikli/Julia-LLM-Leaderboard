[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple approach using regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks and split them into an array of strings\n    m = match(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, dotall=true)\n    if m === nothing\n        return \"\"\n    end\n    blocks = [string(m.captures[1])]\n    \n    while true\n        m = match(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", blocks[end], dotall=true)\n        if m === nothing\n            break\n        end\n        push!(blocks, string(m.captures[1]))\n    end\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join them together with a newline\n    return reduce((x, y) -> x * \"\\n\" * y, blocks)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by using a regular expression to match each code block in the markdown. It then appends each block to an array (`blocks`), removes fences from each block and joins them together with a newline.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that all code blocks are well-formed, meaning they start and end with four backticks followed by \"julia\" and there is no nested code fencing inside the blocks. If your Markdown can contain such cases, you may need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,318],"elapsed":2.537169132,"_type":"aimessage"}]
