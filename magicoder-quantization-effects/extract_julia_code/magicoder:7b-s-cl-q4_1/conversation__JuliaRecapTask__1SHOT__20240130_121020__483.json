[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use Regular Expression to solve this task as well. Here is an example of how you might define the function `extract_julia_code`:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    code_blocks = [m.captures[1] for m in eachmatch(r\"```\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md)]\n    joined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Remove Code Fences\n    fenced_pattern = r\"```\"\n    while occurs(fenced_pattern, joined_code)\n        matched_fence = match(fenced_pattern, joined_code).captures[1]\n        joined_code = replace(joined_code, matched_fence => \"\")\n    end\n    \n    return String(joined_code)\nend\n```\nThis function first uses `eachmatch` to find all occurrences of code blocks in the markdown document. Each match object contains a captures field which is an array of all captures made by the regex pattern, and here it's used to get the text within each code block (`(.*?)`).\n\nThe code is then joined together with newlines using `join`.\n\nFinally, any remaining fences are removed from the code blocks using a while loop that uses the `occurs` function to check if there are any more instances of the fence pattern in the combined code. The `replace` function replaces these fences with nothing (i.e., removes them), and this is repeated until no more fences are found.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that all code blocks do not contain multiple consecutive lines of text that both start and end with triple backticks (```).","status":200,"tokens":[0,389],"elapsed":3.212543835,"_type":"aimessage"}]
