The `re.DOTALL` flag allows the dot (`.`) in the regular expression to match any character, including a newline.\n\nIf there are multiple code blocks found, it joins them with new lines using the `\\n` string. If only one block was found, or no blocks were found at all, an empty string is returned.\n\nRemember that this solution assumes that Julia code blocks do not contain inline backticks (``` `` ``). It may not work correctly if the assumption does not hold for your use case.","status":200,"tokens":[0,296],"elapsed":2.355768896,"_type":"aimessage"}]
