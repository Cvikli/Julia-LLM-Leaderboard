[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The function `extract_julia_code` can be implemented using Regular Expressions in Julia to find and extract the Julia code blocks from the markdown document. Here is a sample solution:\n\n```julia\nusing REGEX\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regex pattern for finding julia code blocks\n    re = r\"```julia(.+?)```\"s\n\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(re, md))   # Get all matches in the markdown document\n    if isempty(matches)\n        return \"\"  # Return empty string if no matches found\n    else\n        codes = map((m)->Makie.strip_code_fences(String([m])), matches) # Extract the code blocks and remove fences\n        joined = join([codes...], \"\\n\")                               # Join them together with newline\n        return joined\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this function, the `eachmatch` function iterates over all matches of the regular expression in the markdown string. For each match (`m`), we use `Makie.strip_code_fences` to remove the code fence from the matched string (as provided by the Markie package). The map function applies this operation to all matches, and then join the resulting strings with newline characters.\n\nPlease note that you need to install the `REGEX` package (`Pkg.add(\"REGEX\")`) and import it before running this code if you have not done so already. You also need to add Makie as a package to your environment (via `using Makie`). \n\nYou can find more information about REGEX in the official Julia documentation: https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REGEX/.","status":200,"tokens":[0,400],"elapsed":3.303751866,"_type":"aimessage"}]
