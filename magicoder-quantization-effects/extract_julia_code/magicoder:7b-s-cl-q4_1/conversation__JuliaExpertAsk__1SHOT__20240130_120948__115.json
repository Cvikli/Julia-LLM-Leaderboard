[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise.

Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of `extract_julia_code`:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Parse the markdown string into blocks\n    parsed = parse_markdown(md)\n\n    # Loop over all blocks, search for code blocks and concatenate their content\n    code_content = \"\"\n    for block in parsed.content\n        if isa(block, CodeBlock) && endswith(block.language, \"julia\")\n            code_content *= join([block.code[i] for i in 1:length(block.code)]; \"\\n\")\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return the concatenated content as a string\n    return code_content\nend\n```\nThis function first parses the markdown to obtain its structure of blocks (lists, code blocks etc.). It then checks each block and if it is a Julia code block, it concatenates its content with newline character. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that your markdown document uses 'Julia' as the programming language for the code blocks. If you have different conventions, this function will need adjustments.","status":200,"tokens":[0,265],"elapsed":2.112365601,"_type":"aimessage"}]
