[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is an example of how you can create such function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    blocks = []\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    block = \"\"\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\") || startswith(line, \"```\") \n            push!(blocks, block)\n            block = \"\"\n        elseif endswith(line, \"```\") && !startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            error(\"Code fences must be consistent\")\n        else\n            block *= line[4:end] # remove code fence\n        end\n    end\n    \n    join([blocks...], \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function `extract_julia_code` works by iterating over each line of the markdown text, and whenever it encounters a line starting with \"```\" or \"```julia\", it starts/stops capturing code blocks. If it finds a line ending in \"```\" but not starting with \"```julia\", an error will be raised because code fences must match. The captured code blocks are then joined together with newline characters, and the resulting string is returned.\n\nIf there are multiple code blocks to extract from `md`, this function will take each block as a separate string in array `blocks`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,322],"elapsed":2.653220941,"_type":"aimessage"}]
