If it encounters code fences (i.e., if a line starts with \"````\" and ends with \"````\"), it removes the fences from the lines of the code block. It then joins all the lines of the code blocks together into one string with newline characters between each line, and appends this to the results string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,442],"elapsed":3.538696226,"_type":"aimessage"}]
