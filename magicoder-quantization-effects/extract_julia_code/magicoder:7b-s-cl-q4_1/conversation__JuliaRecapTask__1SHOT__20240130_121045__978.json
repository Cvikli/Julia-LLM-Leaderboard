[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how to solve this task using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n([^`]+)```\", md))\n    if isempty(matches) \n        return \"\"\n    end\n    \n    # Extract the code from each match\n    codes = map(m -> match(r\"[^`]+\", m.match).match, matches)\n\n    # Join all the codes together with a newline\n    code_block = join(codes, \"\\n\")\n\n    return code_block\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regex to find all Julia code blocks in the markdown document. Each match object contains the matched string, which is the code from the code block. We extract this using `match(r\"[^`]+\", m.match).match`, and join these together with a newline. If there are no matches (i.e., if there are no code blocks), an empty string is returned.\n\nThis function assumes that all code blocks in the markdown document have a language specification of `julia` following the opening fence.","status":200,"tokens":[0,276],"elapsed":2.261441947,"_type":"aimessage"}]
