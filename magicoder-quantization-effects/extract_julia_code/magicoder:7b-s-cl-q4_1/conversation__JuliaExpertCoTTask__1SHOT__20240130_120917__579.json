It repeatedly searches for the pattern of a code block in the string and adds each match to an array. The `extract_julia_code` function then uses this array to extract the relevant parts of each code block, removes the code fences, and joins them together with newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,336],"elapsed":2.713876134,"_type":"aimessage"}]
