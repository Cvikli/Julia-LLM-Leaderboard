[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task you will need to use Julia's built-in `Base64` module for encoding and decoding the markdown document, and `Regex` package for regular expressions. This is because markdown can include different types of code blocks, and we have to ensure that only julia language blocks are extracted.\n\nThe following function accomplishes this:\n\n```julia\nusing Base64, Regex\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Decode the markdown document\n    decoded = String(Base64.b64decode(md))\n    \n    # Find all code blocks using regex pattern\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", decoded, 1))\n    \n    if isempty(matches)\n        return \"\"\n    end\n\n    # Join the captured codes and remove code fences\n    return join([match.captures[1] for match in matches]; \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function first decodes the markdown document from its base64 representation, then finds all matches of the pattern ```julia(.+?)``` using regular expressions, which are code blocks with julia as the language. The .+? is a lazy match that will stop capturing at the first closing triple backticks `'''` it encounters. If no matches are found, an empty string is returned.\n\nThe extracted codes are then joined together with newline characters in between and returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,332],"elapsed":2.911701723,"_type":"aimessage"}]
