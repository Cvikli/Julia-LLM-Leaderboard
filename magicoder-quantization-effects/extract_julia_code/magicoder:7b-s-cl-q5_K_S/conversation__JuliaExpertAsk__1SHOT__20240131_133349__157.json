Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, seed=1))\n\n    if isempty(code_blocks)\n        return \"\"\n    end\n\n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    code = reduce((a, b)->a * \"\\n\" * b[2], map(x -> x.match[1], code_blocks))\n\n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `eachmatch` function to find all occurrences of the pattern \"```julia(.+?)```\", which matches a Julia code block in markdown, and collects them into an array. If no code blocks are found, an empty string is returned. Otherwise, it removes the fences from each code block (i.e., it keeps only the content between the fences) and joins all of them together with a newline character.","status":200,"tokens":[0,260],"elapsed":2.20024728,"_type":"aimessage"}]
