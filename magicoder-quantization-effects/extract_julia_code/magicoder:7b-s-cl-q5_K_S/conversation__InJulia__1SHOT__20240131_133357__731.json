It then iterates over each line. If it encounters a line that starts with \"```julia\", it starts collecting the code in the current block. When it finds a line starting with \"```\" and there's no current block being collected, it stops collecting. Any other lines are added to the current block if they aren't empty or comments (lines starting with \"#\"). At the end of all lines, it joins all collected code blocks together into one string.","status":200,"tokens":[88,358],"elapsed":3.0560299,"_type":"aimessage"}]
