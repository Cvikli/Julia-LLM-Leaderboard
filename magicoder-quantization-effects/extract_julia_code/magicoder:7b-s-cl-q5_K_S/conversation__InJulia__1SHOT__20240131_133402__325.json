[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can implement this using regular expressions in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks\n    blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    # Extract the content of each block and remove the code fences\n    cleaned_blocks = mapreduce(*, vcat, [replace(block.captures[1], \"`\" => \"\") for block in blocks])\n\n    return join(cleaned_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all code blocks in the markdown document. The `eachmatch` function returns an iterator that yields matches of the pattern in order. Each match is a `RegexMatch` object which contains a `captures` field that is a tuple containing the matched string and any capturing groups. \n\nThe `mapreduce` function applies the `replace` function to each block, replacing the code fences with nothing (`\"\"`). The result is a vector of strings, one for each code block. \n\nFinally, the `join` function concatenates all the blocks together into a single string separated by newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,278],"elapsed":2.350308604,"_type":"aimessage"}]
