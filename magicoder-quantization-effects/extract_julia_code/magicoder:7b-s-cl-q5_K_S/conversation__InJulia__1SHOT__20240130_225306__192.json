It then removes the ```julia and ``` from each block, joins them together with a newline character, and returns the resulting string. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is only one level of indentation for the code inside the fences. If your code has more complex structures (like nested code blocks), you may need to adjust the regular expression or use a different approach altogether.","status":200,"tokens":[88,250],"elapsed":2.113825654,"_type":"aimessage"}]
