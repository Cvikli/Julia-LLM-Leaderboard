A code block is identified as a line that starts and ends with backticks (i.e., ```). If a block contains multiple Julia code blocks, this function will join them together.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use the function:\n\n```julia\nmarkdown = \"\"\"\nHello, World!\n\n```julia\nprintln(\"Hello, World!\")\n```\n\nAnother Code Block\n\n```julia\nprint(\"Second Code Block\")\n```\n\"\"\"\nprintln(extract_julia_code(markdown))\n```\nOutput:\n\n```julia\nprintln(\"Hello, World!\")\nprint(\"Second Code Block\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[88,473],"elapsed":4.104542403,"_type":"aimessage"}]
