Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can achieve this using Regular Expression:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(pattern, md))\n    codeblocks = [match.captures[1] for match in matches]\n    \n    # join the code blocks together with a newline\n    combined_code = join([replace(code, r\"```julia\\n\" => \"\") for code in codeblocks], \"\\n\")\n    return combined_code\nend\n```\nThis function works by searching for all occurrences of \"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\" (where .* is any character and ? after .* means 0 or more, but as few as possible), which represents a code block in markdown with the language specified as \"julia\". The captures[1] gets us the content of the first capture group, which corresponds to the julia code inside the fences. It then replaces the \"```julia\\n\" part at the beginning and \"\\n```\" part at the end of each code block. Finally it joins all these codes together with a newline character in between.","status":200,"tokens":[0,283],"elapsed":2.439153985,"_type":"aimessage"}]
