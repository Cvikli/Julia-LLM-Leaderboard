[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String.

When it encounters a code fence (i.e., when it sees \"```\"), it switches between collecting and not collecting code lines until it reaches another code fence. It removes the '    ' part at the beginning of each line as well, which is necessary to make the resulting string valid Julia code. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that all code blocks are properly enclosed by \"```\" and does no error checking or validation on the input. If you need more robust handling of markdown syntax, consider using a library designed for parsing markdown, such as `Documenter.jl`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,361],"elapsed":3.108563675,"_type":"aimessage"}]
