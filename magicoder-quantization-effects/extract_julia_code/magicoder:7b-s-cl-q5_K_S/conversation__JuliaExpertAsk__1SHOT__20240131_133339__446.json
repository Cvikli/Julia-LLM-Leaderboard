Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of your request using Python's markdown library:\n\n```python\nimport markdown\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    html = markdown.markdown(md)\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')\n    \n    code_blocks = soup.find_all('pre', class_='code')\n    \n    julia_code = \"\"\n    \n    for block in code_blocks:\n        language = block.find('span', class_='language')\n        \n        if language and language.text == 'julia':\n            julia_code += \"\\n\" + block.text.strip()\n            \n    return julia_code\n```\n\nThis function converts the markdown text to HTML, then parses the HTML with BeautifulSoup. It finds all pre elements (which are code blocks in markdown) and checks if they contain a span element with the class 'language' that has the text 'julia'. If it does, it adds the contents of the code block (minus any leading or trailing whitespace) to the `julia_code` string.\n\nRemember to install necessary libraries:\n```bash\npip install markdown beautifulsoup4\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,290],"elapsed":2.4556894,"_type":"aimessage"}]
