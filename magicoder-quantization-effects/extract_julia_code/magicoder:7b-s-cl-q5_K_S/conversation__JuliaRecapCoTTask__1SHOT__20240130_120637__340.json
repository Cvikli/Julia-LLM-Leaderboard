[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you might approach this task using regular expressions in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Code block pattern\n    code_block_pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"ms\n    \n    # Replace the multi-line code blocks with a newline joined version\n    md_new = replace(md, code_block_pattern => s -> join(splitlines(s), \"\\n\"))\n    \n    return md_new\nend\n```\nThis `extract_julia_code` function uses regular expression to find the Julia code blocks and then replaces them with a newline-joined version. It's important to note that this approach assumes that there is only one level of nested code blocks, which may not be ideal for more complex documents.\n\nPlease replace `{{instructions}}` in the Special Instructions field with your specific instructions if any.","status":200,"tokens":[0,214],"elapsed":1.880695288,"_type":"aimessage"}]
