Then it removes all code fences (defined as lines starting with ``` and ending with ```) using `replace` and `strip` functions. Finally, it joins all extracted code blocks together with a newline character.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the markdown document is correctly formatted and each julia code block starts with \"```julia\" and ends with \"```\". If this is not the case, you might want to add error checking or adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,256],"elapsed":2.162880091,"_type":"aimessage"}]
