Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you could write this function in Julia:\n```Julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all start and end indices of code blocks\n    starts = [findfirst(isequal('`' * '`' * '`' * \"julia\"), md)]\n    ends = Int64[]\n    \n    for i in 1:length(starts)-1\n        push!(ends, findfirst(isequal('`' * '`' * \"`\"), md, starts[i] + 5))\n        push!(starts, findfirst(isequal('`' * '`' * \"julia\"), md, ends[i] + 2))\n    end\n    \n    # Extract code blocks\n    code_blocks = map(1:length(starts), starts) do i\n        return substr(md, starts[i], ends[i])\n    end\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join together\n    joined_code = join(map(code_blocks) do block\n        block[7:end-3]\n    end, \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nThis function works by first finding the start and end indices of all code blocks in your markdown document. It then extracts each code block using those indices, removes the code fences, and joins them together with a newline character. The resulting string is the entire code written in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[0,319],"elapsed":2.735527432,"_type":"aimessage"}]
