[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = []\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            start_index = findfirst(\"```\", line)[end] + 1\n            end_index = findlast(\"```\", line)[start] - 1\n            code_blocks = vcat(code_blocks, split(line[start_index:end_index], '\\n')[2:end]) # exclude the first and last lines which are empty due to code fences\n        end\n    end\n    join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each line in the markdown document. If a line starts with \"```julia\", it extracts the Julia code block and adds it to `code_blocks`. Finally, it joins all the blocks together into one string.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that there are no nested code fences (i.e., ``` inside ```). If such cases exist in your markdown document, you would need a more complex solution.","status":200,"tokens":[0,284],"elapsed":2.438486013,"_type":"aimessage"}]
