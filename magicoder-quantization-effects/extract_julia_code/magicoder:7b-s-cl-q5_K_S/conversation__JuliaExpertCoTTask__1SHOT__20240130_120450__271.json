If it encounters a line that starts with \"```\", it either starts or ends a code block. If it's starting a Julia code block, it begins recording lines for this block (by initializing an empty string). If it's ending a Julia code block (i.e., finding a line that doesn't start with \"```julia\"), it stops recording lines for the current block and starts building up the next one. Finally, if it encounters any other line while in a code block (not starting or ending a block), it appends that line to the current block string. It then combines all of these strings into a single string separated by newlines before returning it.","status":200,"tokens":[254,435],"elapsed":5.513972162,"_type":"aimessage"}]
