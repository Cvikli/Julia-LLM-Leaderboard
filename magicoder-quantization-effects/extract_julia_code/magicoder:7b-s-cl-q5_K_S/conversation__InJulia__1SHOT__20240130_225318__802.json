It then removes the code fences and joins the code blocks together with a newline. The result is returned as a string.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that there are no nested code blocks, i.e., it will only join consecutive code blocks together. If you have nested code blocks or other complex markdown structures, you may need to use a more sophisticated approach.","status":200,"tokens":[0,253],"elapsed":2.110542483,"_type":"aimessage"}]
