Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution for your problem:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    pattern = r'```(.*?)```'  # regex pattern to find code blocks\n    matches = re.findall(pattern, md, re.DOTALL)  # find all matches\n    \n    if not matches:\n        return \"\"\n    \n    # remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    julia_code = \"\\n\".join([match[4:-4] for match in matches])  # [4:-4] to remove the ```fence\n    return julia_code\n```\n\nThis function first finds all matches of the markdown code blocks using the `re.findall` method with a regular expression pattern, then removes the code fences and joins them together. Note that the code is assumed to be between four backticks (```), so `[4:-4]` is used to remove these.\n\nThis function will return an empty string if no matches are found in the input markdown document. If there are multiple matches, they will be joined with a newline character.","status":200,"tokens":[0,253],"elapsed":2.18309053,"_type":"aimessage"}]
