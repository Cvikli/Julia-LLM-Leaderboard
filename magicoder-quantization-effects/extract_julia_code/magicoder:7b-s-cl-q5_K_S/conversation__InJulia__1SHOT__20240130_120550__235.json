The pattern we are interested in is ````.*?```` which matches any character (except for a newline) between ````` and `````, and `.*?` makes it a non-greedy match, so that it doesn't take up all the characters until the last ````. This gives us an array of strings where each string is a Julia code block. We then use `replace` to remove the fences (```) from each code block and join them together with a newline using `join`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,390],"elapsed":3.35640372,"_type":"aimessage"}]
