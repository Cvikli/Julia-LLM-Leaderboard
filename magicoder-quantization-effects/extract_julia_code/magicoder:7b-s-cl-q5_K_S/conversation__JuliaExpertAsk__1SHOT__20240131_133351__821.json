Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Find all code blocks\n    blocks = collect.(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=Vector{SubString{String}}()))\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    code = reduce((a, b)->a * \"\\n\" * b, map(x->replace(x, \"`\" => \"\"), blocks))\n    \n    return code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by using regular expressions to match all code blocks in the markdown document. It then removes the code fences and joins the code blocks together with a newline. The result is a string containing the Julia code. \n\nNote that this solution assumes that there are no nested code blocks, i.e., it does not handle situations where one block of code is inside another. If your markdown document can have nested code blocks, you will need to adjust the regular expression and/or the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,253],"elapsed":2.139098705,"_type":"aimessage"}]
