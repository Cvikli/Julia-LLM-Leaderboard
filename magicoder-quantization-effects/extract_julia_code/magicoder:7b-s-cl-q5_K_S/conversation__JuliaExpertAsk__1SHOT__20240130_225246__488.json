Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks and extract the content\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    # Join all code blocks together with a newline in between\n    joined_code = join([m.captures[1] for m in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find the code blocks and extract the content within them. It then joins all of these blocks together with a newline character between each one. Please note that this assumes that there are no nested code blocks, as Julia Markdown does not support such syntax.","status":200,"tokens":[0,183],"elapsed":1.529969284,"_type":"aimessage"}]
