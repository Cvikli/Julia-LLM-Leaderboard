[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could write this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all matches of the julia code fence pattern\n    fences = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    if isempty(fences) \n        return \"\" \n    end\n\n    # Join all the matches to get the code blocks\n    code_blocks = join([M.captures[1] for M in fences], \"\\n\")\n\n    # Remove any leading or trailing whitespace\n    cleaned_code_blocks = replace(code_blocks, r\"^\\s+|\\s+$\", \"\")\n    \n    return cleaned_code_blocks\nend\n``` \n\nThis function first finds all matches of the code fence pattern in your markdown document. If there are no matches (i.e., no julia code blocks), it returns an empty string. Otherwise, it joins all the matched code blocks together with a newline and removes any leading or trailing whitespace. It then returns this cleaned up string as the result. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is only one set of triple backticks (````...```) per code block. If your markdown can have multiple sets, you'll need to adjust this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,313],"elapsed":2.673201402,"_type":"aimessage"}]
