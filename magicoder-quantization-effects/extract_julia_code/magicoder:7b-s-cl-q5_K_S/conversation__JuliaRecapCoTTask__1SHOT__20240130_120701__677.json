[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The function `extract_julia_code` can be implemented using regular expressions to find the code blocks in markdown and then join them into one string. Note that this will only work if there are no indentation levels within the Julia code, which would cause incorrect results. For handling multi-level indentation (e.g., nested control structures), a more sophisticated parser would be needed.\n\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Find all code blocks in markdown\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    if isempty(matches)\n        return \"\"\n    else\n        # Remove code fences and join the code blocks into one string with newline\n        code_blocks = [replace(match[1], \"\\n\" => \"\") for match in matches]\n        joined_code = join([code_blocks...]; '\\n')\n        return joined_code\n    end\nend\n```\nThe `eachmatch` function returns an iterator that produces Match instances for each non-overlapping match of the pattern in the string. The `?` in `.*?` makes it a non-greedy search, so it will stop at the first occurrence of two consecutive newlines.\n\nThis function assumes that there is only one level of indentation within the code blocks, and does not account for nested code blocks or fences. If you have complex markdown syntax with multiple levels of indentation or nested fenced code blocks, a more sophisticated solution would be needed, possibly using some combination of the `Md` package (which can parse Markdown into an abstract syntax tree) and Julia's built-in parsing libraries.","status":200,"tokens":[0,393],"elapsed":3.466861704,"_type":"aimessage"}]
