[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can extract all Julia code from a markdown document using regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nusing README, Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Extract all code blocks with the language set to \"julia\"\n    julia_blocks = filter(x -> x.language == \"julia\", parse_code_blocks(md))\n    \n    # Concatenate the code blocks into a single string, removing fences and newlines\n    code = join([replace(x.code, r\"^```julia\\n|```$\" => \"\") for x in julia_blocks]; \"\\n\")\n    \n    return code\nend\n```\n\nIn the above function:\n- `parse_code_blocks` is a helper function from README.jl package which parses markdown string and returns array of CodeBlock objects where each object contains language, code, and range info. \n- The filter function then filters out the blocks where the language is \"julia\".\n- `replace(x.code, r\"^```julia\\n|```$\" => \"\")` removes the fences from the Julia code. It uses a regular expression to match the start and end of each block of code. The \"^```julia\\n\" matches the start of the code block (i.e., ```julia) and \"\\n```$\" matches the end of the code block (i.e., ```).\n- Finally, `join([replace(x.code, r\"^```julia\\n|```$\" => \"\") for x in julia_blocks]; \"\\n\")` joins all the extracted Julia blocks together into a single string with newline characters between each block of code. \n\nThe function returns this combined string as the output.","status":200,"tokens":[0,414],"elapsed":3.613106043,"_type":"aimessage"}]
