It then concatenates these together with a newline in between and removes any remaining backticks (`` ` ``). If there are no matches, it returns an empty string. \n\nPlease note that this is a very basic implementation and does not handle nested or escaped fences, nor does it remove leading/trailing whitespace from each line of code. For production-level use, you may want to consider using a robust library for parsing markdown such as `Markdown.jl`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,280],"elapsed":2.364352452,"_type":"aimessage"}]
