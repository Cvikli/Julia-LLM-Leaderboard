[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    blocks = split(md, \"```\", keepempty=false)  # Split the document into code blocks.\n    \n    result = \"\"\n    for block in blocks\n        if startswith(block, \"julia\")\n            code = strip(block[7:end])  # Remove code fences.\n            result *= (isempty(result) ? \"\" : \"\\n\") * code  # Join the blocks together with a newline.\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\nThis function works by first splitting the markdown document into separate code blocks, then iterating through each block and checking if it starts with \"julia\". If so, the code is extracted and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace. It then gets added to the `result` variable after a newline (if there isn't one already) for formatting.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that every \"code block\" in the markdown document starts with '```julia'. If you need to handle more complex markdown syntax, or if you have to extract code from different languages, then the solution would be more complicated.","status":200,"tokens":[0,286],"elapsed":2.48097425,"_type":"aimessage"}]
