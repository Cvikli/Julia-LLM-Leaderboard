[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can approach this problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    code_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, dotall=true)\n\n    # If there's only one block, return it directly\n    if length(code_blocks) == 1\n        return code_blocks[1]\n    end\n\n    # Otherwise, concatenate all blocks with a newline in between\n    joined_code = join([strip(c, \"`\") for c in code_blocks], \"\\n\\n\")\n\n    # Remove any leading or trailing whitespace from each line of the code\n    joined_code = replace(joined_code, r\"\\n +\" => \"\\n\")\n\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to match all occurrences of Julia code blocks in the markdown document. It then concatenates these blocks together with a newline character between each block (to separate them), and removes any leading or trailing whitespace from each line of the resulting code. \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that there are no nested code fences within the markdown document, and it does not handle escaping of special characters in Julia strings. For more complex scenarios, you may need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,311],"elapsed":2.709547752,"_type":"aimessage"}]
