[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all Julia code from a markdown document:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    code_blocks = String[]\n    in_code_block = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```\")\n            in_code_block = !in_code_block\n        elseif in_code_block && !startswith(line, \"`\")\n            push!(code_blocks, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    join(code_blocks, '\\n')\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each line of the markdown document. If it encounters a line that starts with ``` (which is how code fences are denoted in markdown), it toggles whether or not we're currently inside a code block. If we're inside a code block and encounter a line that doesn't start with ` (which would be the case if there were any other characters before the code fence on that line), we add that line to our list of code blocks. Finally, we join all of the code blocks together into one string separated by newlines.\n\nThis function assumes that each code block in your markdown document is properly delimited by ``` and ``` lines, and that there are no other lines starting with ` within those code blocks. If your markdown documents have more complex structures (like nested code fences or inline code), you'll need to adjust this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,355],"elapsed":3.055160695,"_type":"aimessage"}]
