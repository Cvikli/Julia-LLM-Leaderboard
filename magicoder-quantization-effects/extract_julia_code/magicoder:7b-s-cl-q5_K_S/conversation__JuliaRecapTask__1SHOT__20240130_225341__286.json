[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = []\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            push!(code_blocks, \"\")\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && isempty(code_blocks)\n            error(\"Invalid markdown format.

If it encounters a line that starts with ```julia, it starts recording lines into a new code block. If it encounters a line that starts with ``, and there are no currently recorded blocks, it throws an error. Otherwise, if there is a current block being recorded, it appends the current line to this block. After going through all lines, it replaces ``` at start and end of each code block and joins them together into one string.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that markdown documents are formatted correctly, i.e., every code block starts with ````julia` and ends with ````. If the document is not properly formatted, it may result in incorrect output or errors.","status":200,"tokens":[0,365],"elapsed":3.143465922,"_type":"aimessage"}]
