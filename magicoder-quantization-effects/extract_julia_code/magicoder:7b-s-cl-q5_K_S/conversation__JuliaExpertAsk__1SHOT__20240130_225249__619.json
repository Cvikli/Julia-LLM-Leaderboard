Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution using the `markdown2` library to parse the markdown document:\n\n```python\nimport re\nfrom markdown2 import Markdown\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    md = Markdown().convert(md)  # Convert markdown to HTML\n    \n    # Extract code blocks using regex\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```(.*?)```', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks with a newline\n    joined_code = '\\n'.join([re.sub(r'```', '', block) for block in code_blocks])\n    \n    return joined_code\n```\n\nThis function first converts the markdown document to HTML using `markdown2` library, which allows it to handle more complex cases than a simple regex could. Then, it finds all code blocks (which are surrounded by three backticks) in the HTML and removes the fences. Finally, it joins these code blocks with newline characters.\n\nPlease note that you need to install `markdown2` library if not installed yet:\n```bash\npip install markdown2\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,265],"elapsed":2.20934634,"_type":"aimessage"}]
