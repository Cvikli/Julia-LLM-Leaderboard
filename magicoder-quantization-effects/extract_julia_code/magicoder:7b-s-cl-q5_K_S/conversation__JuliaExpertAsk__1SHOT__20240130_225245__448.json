Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple solution using regular expressions in Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # Find all code blocks\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```(.*?)```', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = '\\n'.join([block.strip() for block in code_blocks])\n    \n    return joined_code\n```\n\nThis function works by using regular expressions to find all occurrences of strings enclosed between three backticks (```). The `re.DOTALL` flag is used to make the `.` special character match any character, including a newline. \n\nThe extracted code blocks are then stripped of leading and trailing whitespace with the `strip()` method, and joined together into a single string separated by newlines. \n\nThis function assumes that there will be at least one code block in the markdown document. If there might not always be code blocks, you should add error checking to handle this case.","status":200,"tokens":[118,245],"elapsed":2.081834322,"_type":"aimessage"}]
