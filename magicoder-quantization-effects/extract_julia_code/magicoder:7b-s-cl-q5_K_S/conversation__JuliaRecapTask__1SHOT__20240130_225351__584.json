[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all Julia language code blocks from the markdown document:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    # Concatenate all code blocks into a single string\n    combined_code = join([m.captures[1] for m in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n\n    return combined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all code blocks in the markdown document. The pattern `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\" matches a string that starts with ```julia, followed by any characters (`.*?` is a non-greedy match), and ends with ``` again.\n\nThe function then concatenates all the code blocks into a single string using `join`, and returns this combined string.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no nested code blocks in the markdown document, as Julia's standard library does not support nested fenced code blocks. If your markdown document can contain nested code blocks, you will need to adjust the regular expression pattern accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,297],"elapsed":2.556850245,"_type":"aimessage"}]
