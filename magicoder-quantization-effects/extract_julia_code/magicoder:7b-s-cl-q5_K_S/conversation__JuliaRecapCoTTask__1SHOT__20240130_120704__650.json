[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

We will use regular expressions (`Regex`) for pattern matching and replace operations. \n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String) :: String\n    # Code block pattern in markdown:\n    # ```julia\n    # code\n    # ```\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\"s \n    \n    matches = collect(eachmatch(pattern, md))\n    if isempty(matches)\n        return \"\"\n    end\n\n    codes = join([replace(m[1], \"\\n\") for m in matches]; '\\n')\n    return codes\nend\n```\n\nThe `extract_julia_code` function first searches for all the matching code blocks using a regular expression pattern that matches `md`'s content. Afterwards, it extracts the code from each match and joins them together with newline characters. \n\nNow let's define an example usage of this function:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Title\nSome text here...\n\n```julia\nfunction f(x)\n    x^2\nend\n```\nAnd some more text...\n\n```julia\ng(x) = x^3\n```\n\"\"\"\n\nprint(extract_julia_code(md))  # Prints the extracted Julia code.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,355],"elapsed":3.127753903,"_type":"aimessage"}]
