Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of your request in Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # Find all code blocks using regular expression\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```(.*?)```', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline and remove code fences\n    joined_code = '\\n'.join(code_blocks).replace('```', '')\n    \n    return joined_code\n```\n\nThis function uses Python's built-in `re` module to find all instances of code blocks in the markdown document. It then joins these together with a newline and removes any remaining code fences (```...```). The result is returned as a string. \n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes that your markdown document only contains one type of code block, i.e., it does not mix different types of code blocks (like inline code or different languages). If you have such a situation, the function may need to be adjusted accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,235],"elapsed":1.968576443,"_type":"aimessage"}]
