[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could define the `extract_julia_code` function. \n\n```julia\nimport Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Parse Markdown string to AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)\n    ast = Markdown.parse(md)\n\n    # Iterate over the elements in the AST tree\n    code_blocks = \"\"\n    for el in ast.content\n        if isa(el, Markdown.CodeBlock) && startswith(el.language, \"julia\")\n            # Extract and join all lines of the CodeBlock\n            lines = split(raw(el), \"\\n\", keepempty=false)\n            code_blocks *= join(lines[2:end], \"\\n\")\n        end\n    end\n    return code_blocks\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a string of Markdown as input, parses it into an Abstract Syntax Tree using `Markdown.parse`, then iterates over the tree elements. If an element is a CodeBlock with Julia language (i.e., its first line contains \"julia\"), the function extracts all the lines in the CodeBlock excluding the first one (which is just the fence) and joins them together into a string, which it then returns.\n\nThis solution assumes that the code blocks you're interested in are well-behaved i.e., each code block is preceded and followed by an empty line. If this is not always the case (for example if your input markdown sometimes contains multiple consecutive code blocks), you might want to adjust this function accordingly.\n\nThis solution also imports `Markdown` module from Markdown.jl package, which must be installed in Julia environment. You can add it using Pkg: \n```julia\nPkg.add(\"Markdown\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,416],"elapsed":3.689897343,"_type":"aimessage"}]
