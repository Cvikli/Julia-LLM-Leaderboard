Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution for your problem.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    pattern = r'```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```'\n    code_blocks = re.findall(pattern, md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    if len(code_blocks) == 0:\n        return \"\"\n    \n    joined_code = \"\\n\".join(code_blocks)\n    return joined_code\n```\n\nThis function uses the `re` module to find all code blocks in the markdown document. It looks for lines that start with three backticks (```), followed by \"julia\", and then captures everything until it encounters three backticks again (denoted by `.*?`). The `re.DOTALL` flag allows the dot (.) to match any character, including newline characters.\n\nPlease note that this function will return all code blocks in one string separated by newlines. If you want to keep them separate, simply remove the join operation (`return \"\\n\".join(code_blocks)`).","status":200,"tokens":[118,250],"elapsed":2.149762662,"_type":"aimessage"}]
