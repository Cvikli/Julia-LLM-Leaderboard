[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

When it encounters a line that starts with ``` (a code fence), it starts capturing the next lines until another line starting with ``` is encountered, indicating the end of the current block. It stores the language specified before the ``` and the joined contents of all the lines in the current block in a dictionary where keys are languages and values are the respective code blocks. At the end if there were multiple code blocks, it joins them together separated by newlines. If no code blocks were found, it returns an empty string.\nPlease note that this function does not handle nested code blocks, i.e., it assumes each block is independent of each other and doesn't have any overlaps.","status":200,"tokens":[0,419],"elapsed":3.720191934,"_type":"aimessage"}]
