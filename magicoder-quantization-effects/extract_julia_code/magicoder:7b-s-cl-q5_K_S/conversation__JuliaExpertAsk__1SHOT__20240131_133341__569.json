Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution for this problem:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # pattern to match code fences\n    pattern = r'```(.*?)```'\n    \n    # find all matches of the pattern in md\n    matches = re.findall(pattern, md)\n    \n    # join all matches together with a newline and remove code fences\n    julia_code = \"\\n\".join([match[4:-4] for match in matches])\n    \n    return julia_code\n```\n\nThis function uses the `re` module to find all occurrences of the pattern (i.e., strings between three backticks) in `md`, then joins them together with a newline character. Note that it assumes that there are no four-space indents at the beginning of lines within code blocks, which is common but not universal among Julia language programmers.\n\nThis function does not handle cases where multiple code fences are used to separate different sections of code, or where the code block contains inline backticks. For more complex use cases, you might need a more sophisticated approach.","status":200,"tokens":[0,255],"elapsed":2.159886396,"_type":"aimessage"}]
