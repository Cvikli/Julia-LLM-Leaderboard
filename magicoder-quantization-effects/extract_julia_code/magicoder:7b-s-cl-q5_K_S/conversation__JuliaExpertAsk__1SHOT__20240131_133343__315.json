Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of the function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Find all code blocks\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks\n    joined_code = join([replace(m.captures[1], r\"^```julia$\" => \"\") for m in code_blocks]; '\\n')\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to match and extract the Julia code blocks from the markdown document `md`. It then removes the code fences (i.e., ```julia and ```) from each block of code and joins them all together with a newline character. The result is returned as a String.","status":200,"tokens":[0,201],"elapsed":1.698662517,"_type":"aimessage"}]
