Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this task in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document.\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, greedy=false))\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline.\n    code_blocks = [replace(m[1], r\"^```|\\n```$\" => \"\") for m in matches]\n    combined_code = join([code_blocks...]; \"\\n\")\n    \n    return String(combined_code)\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `eachmatch` function to find all occurrences of code blocks in the markdown document. It then removes the code fences from each block and joins them together into a single string with newlines between each code block. \n\nThe regular expression used here (`\"```julia(.+?)````) matches any text that starts and ends with three backticks followed by \"julia\", capturing everything in between as the actual Julia code. The `greedy=false` argument ensures it doesn't match the entire document at once but instead matches each individual code block individually.\n\nThe function returns a String, which is the combined code from all of the code blocks in the markdown document.","status":200,"tokens":[254,312],"elapsed":7.870097799,"_type":"aimessage"}]
