[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise.

Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem using Python's `re` module:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    pattern = r'```(.*?)```'  # matches markdown code blocks\n    code_blocks = re.findall(pattern, md, re.DOTALL)  # find all code blocks\n    \n    cleaned_code = ''\n    for block in code_blocks:\n        cleaned_code += block + '\\n'  # add a newline after each block\n\n    return cleaned_code.strip()  # remove leading/trailing whitespace\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to match markdown code blocks, then concatenates all the matched code blocks together with a newline character in between. The `re.DOTALL` flag is used to make `.` match any character at all including newlines.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes your input `md` is just one continuous string and doesn't contain extra newline characters inside Julia code blocks. \n\nIf you want to support nested code blocks, or if your input may have newline characters within the code blocks, then you will need a more complex regular expression.\n\nAlso note that this function returns a single string with all found Julia code blocks joined by newlines. If you wish to return an array of individual code blocks instead, simply change `cleaned_code += block + '\\n'` to `cleaned_code.append(block)`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,327],"elapsed":2.813844416,"_type":"aimessage"}]
