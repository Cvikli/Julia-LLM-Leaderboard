Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of this function using Julia's regular expressions module `Regex`. The function uses two regex patterns to match and extract the Julia code from markdown code blocks: one for matching the code block start (fences), and another for capturing the actual content within those fences. It then removes the fences using `replace` method of a String.\n\n```julia\nusing REPL\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regular expressions for matching code blocks start and end.\n    re_start = r\"^(```)\"  \n    re_end   = r\"(```)$\" \n\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(re_start * REPL.LineEdit.Text.s_anything * re_end, md, anchors=(true,false)))\n    \n    code_blocks = String[]\n    for match in matches\n        push!(code_blocks, replace(match[1], \"```julia\" => \"\"))  # Remove ```julia from the matched part.\n    end\n    \n    join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function will return all Julia code blocks as one string with newlines between each code block. Note that it does not handle cases where there are multiple code fences in a row (e.g., ```` ``` ````) or if the language is specified after \"```\". If you need to support those cases, adjusting the regular expression patterns would be necessary. \n\nThis function uses `REPL.LineEdit.Text.s_anything` which matches any character except for a newline. This is important because markdown code blocks can include newlines but they will all be treated as part of the block until the end marker is found.","status":200,"tokens":[0,393],"elapsed":3.48300827,"_type":"aimessage"}]
