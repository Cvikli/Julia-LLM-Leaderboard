[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem, you can use a combination of the `Base` functions `read`, `readlines`, and `match`. The function will start by reading in the Markdown file as lines of text. It then loops over these lines, checking for code blocks using regular expressions. When a code block is found, it removes the surrounding fences (```julia) and joins them together into one string.\n\nHere's an example of how you can implement this function:\n\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(filename::String)\n    # Read in the markdown as lines of text\n    md = readlines(filename)\n\n    code_blocks = String[]\n\n    for line in md\n        match = match(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\", line, seed=Regex())\n        \n        if match !== nothing \n            # Remove code fences and join lines together with a newline\n            block = replace(match[1], r\"\\n\" => \"\\n\")\n            \n            push!(code_blocks, block)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function reads the markdown file line by line, looking for code blocks. It then removes the fences and joins them together into a single string which is returned as the result. Note that this function assumes that the input `filename` exists and is valid. If there are multiple consecutive code blocks or if they're not on separate lines in the file, this function will concatenate them without an extra newline in between.","status":200,"tokens":[0,360],"elapsed":3.23779898,"_type":"aimessage"}]
