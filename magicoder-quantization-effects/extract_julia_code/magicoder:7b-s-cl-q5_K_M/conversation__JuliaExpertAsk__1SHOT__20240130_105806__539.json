Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution using regular expressions:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    pattern = r'```julia\\n(.*?)```'\n    code_blocks = re.findall(pattern, md, re.DOTALL) # re.DOTALL to make . match any character including newline\n    \n    joined_code = '\\n'.join(code_blocks)  # join blocks with a newline\n    return joined_code\n```\n\nThis function uses the `re` module in Python, which provides support for regular expressions. The pattern used here is a regular expression that matches code fences. The `.` character in regex means \"any character\", and the `*` after it means \"zero or more of the preceding element\". The `\\n` stands for newline. Therefore, `(.*?)` captures everything between ```julia and ```, excluding anything that follows (similar to how (.*) would capture everything).\n\nThe function `re.findall()` returns a list with all matches. We use `re.DOTALL` flag to make `.` match any character including newline. Finally, we join the code blocks using newline and return the result as string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,271],"elapsed":2.389068257,"_type":"aimessage"}]
