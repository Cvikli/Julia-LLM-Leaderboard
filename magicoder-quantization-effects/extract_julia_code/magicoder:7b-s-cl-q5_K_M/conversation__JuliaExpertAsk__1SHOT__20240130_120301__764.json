Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can write this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # find all code blocks using regex\n    blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\", md, seperator=true))\n\n    # join the blocks together with a newline character\n    joined_blocks = join(blocks[i][2] for i in 1:length(blocks), \"\\n\")\n\n    return joined_blocks\nend\n```\nThis function works by using a regular expression to match and extract all Julia language code blocks from the input markdown string. It uses `eachmatch` to find all matches, which returns an iterator of tuples where each tuple is (the matched substring, the start index, end index). We then use `collect(eachmatch(...))` to convert that into a list of substrings.\n\nThe code blocks are collected from the 2nd element in each tuple, because the first element is always the matched substring and the second element is the captured group (i.e., what was inside the fences).\n\nFinally, we use `join` to join all the code blocks together with a newline character. Note that we only join the code blocks together, so any code within a block will not be joined with other code in another block.","status":200,"tokens":[0,300],"elapsed":2.671871963,"_type":"aimessage"}]
