It does this by first removing the code fences using regular expressions, then joining all the non-empty lines of code together with a newline character. It returns the resulting string. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the code blocks are properly formatted and start and end with '```julia'. If you have different or more complex requirements, you'd need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,294],"elapsed":2.581794386,"_type":"aimessage"}]
