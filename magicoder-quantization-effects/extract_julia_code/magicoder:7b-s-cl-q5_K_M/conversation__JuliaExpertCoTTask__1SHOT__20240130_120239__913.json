[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use regular expressions to solve this problem. Here is a function that solves the task:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Use regex to find all code blocks in markdown document\n    codes = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, seed=1));\n    \n    if isempty(codes)  # If no code block found\n        return \"\"\n    end\n    \n    # Remove the code fences from each block and join with newline.\n    combined_code = reduce((a, b) -> a * \"\\n\" * b, (c[1] for c in codes))\n    \n    return combined_code;\nend\n```\n\nTo use this function, you pass your markdown document as a string to the `extract_julia_code` function. It returns the combined code blocks without code fences as a string. Note that you should add backticks (` ```) around the code blocks when using it in other places like a REPL or IJulia notebook, because these are needed for markdown syntax.\n\n```julia\nprintln(extract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\"))\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,286],"elapsed":2.523498577,"_type":"aimessage"}]
