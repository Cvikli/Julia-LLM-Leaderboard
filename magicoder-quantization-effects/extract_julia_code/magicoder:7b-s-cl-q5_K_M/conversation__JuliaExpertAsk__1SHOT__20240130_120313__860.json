Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can implement the `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString) \n    blocks = [b for b in split(md, \"\\n\\n\") if startswith(b, \"`\") && endswith(b, \"`\")]\n    code = join([replace(block[3:end-1], r\"`\" => \"\") for block in blocks], \"\\n\")\n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the markdown text into blocks, filtering out those that don't appear to be Julia code (i.e., they do not start and end with backticks), and then removing the backticks from each block of Julia code. It then joins all of these code blocks together with a newline character in between.\n\nPlease note: This function assumes that your code blocks are correctly formatted as per markdown language specifications, i.e., they start and end with three backticks (`` ` ``). If the blocks can be irregular or have different number of backticks or any other issues, you will need to modify this function accordingly.\n\nAlso, this function will join all the code blocks together without considering whether one block ends with a semicolon and next starts with it. If you want to preserve these semicolons, please update the function as per your requirement.","status":200,"tokens":[0,307],"elapsed":2.761490488,"_type":"aimessage"}]
