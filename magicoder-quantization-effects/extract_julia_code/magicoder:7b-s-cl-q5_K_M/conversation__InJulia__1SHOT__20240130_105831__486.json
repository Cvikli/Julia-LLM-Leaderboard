It then parses each block to get its content and language. If it's a julia code block, it concatenates all the contents with newline characters between them and removes any code fences. The result is returned as a string.\n\nPlease note that you need to have the `Markdown` package installed in your Julia environment to use this function. You can add it using: \n```julia\n]add Markdown\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,225],"elapsed":1.972218968,"_type":"aimessage"}]
