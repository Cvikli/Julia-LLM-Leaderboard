Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple way to do it using regular expressions:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # find all code blocks\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```(.*?)```\", md, capture=2));\n\n    if length(matches) == 0\n        return \"\"\n    end\n\n    # join the matched code blocks with newline characters\n    joined_code = join([replace(m, r\"\\n\" => \"\\n\\n\") for m in matches]; sep=\"\\n\\n\")\n\n    # remove backticks and leading/trailing whitespace\n    cleaned_joined_code = replace(joined_code, \"`\" => \"\")\n\n    return cleaned_joined_code\nend\n```\nIn this function:\n1. `eachmatch` is used to find all matches of the regular expression in `md`. The result is a lazy collection of substrings that match the regex (capture=2 means we only care about group 2, which contains the code block).\n2. We use `collect(eachmatch(...))` to turn this into an array.\n3. If there are no matches at all, i.e., if `length(matches) == 0`, we return an empty string.\n4. We join together all of these matched strings with newline characters (this is achieved by joining on \"\\\\n\\\\n\") and then remove the leading and trailing whitespace.\n5. The function finally returns this as a String.","status":200,"tokens":[0,334],"elapsed":2.982000684,"_type":"aimessage"}]
