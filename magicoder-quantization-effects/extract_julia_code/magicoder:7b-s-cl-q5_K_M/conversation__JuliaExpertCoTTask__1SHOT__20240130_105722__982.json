Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem by using regular expressions (regex) in Python. The `re` module provides support for regular expressions. Here's a function that extracts the code blocks:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```julia(.+?)```', md, re.DOTALL) # DOTALL flag makes . match any character including newline \n    \n    if len(code_blocks) > 1:\n        return \"\\n\".join(code_blocks)\n        \n    elif len(code_blocks) == 1:\n        return code_blocks[0]\n    \n    else:\n        return None # or handle it in some other way\n```\nThis function will find all occurrences of text that starts and ends with a set of three backticks (```), and then within those is \"julia\", followed by the code block. The `re.DOTALL` flag allows the `.` (dot) to match any character, including newline. It joins the blocks together if there are multiple ones found, but returns only one if there's only one. If no matches found, it will return None or handle it in some other way.\n\nThe function `re.findall()` returns a list of all non-overlapping matches of pattern in string, as a list of strings. The string is scanned left-to-right, and matches are returned in the order found.","status":200,"tokens":[254,336],"elapsed":4.62637849,"_type":"aimessage"}]
