Then it removes the fences from each block using `replace`, and joins them into one string with a newline between each block using `join`.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes your code blocks are correctly formatted: they start with four spaces (or a single tab) before the Julia language marker, and end with the same number of spaces/tabs. If there's any variation in formatting (like tabs instead of spaces, or more than 4 spaces), you may need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,292],"elapsed":2.551822515,"_type":"aimessage"}]
