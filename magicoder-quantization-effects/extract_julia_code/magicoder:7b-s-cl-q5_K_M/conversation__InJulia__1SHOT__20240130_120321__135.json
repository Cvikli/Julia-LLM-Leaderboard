It then removes the code fences and joins the code together with a newline, returning it as a String.\n\nPlease note that this is an implementation for a hypothetical `README_Julia` package which does not exist in reality. If you want to use this function in your own script or project, please replace `README_Julia` with the actual name of your Julia package/module.","status":200,"tokens":[88,267],"elapsed":2.397897102,"_type":"aimessage"}]
