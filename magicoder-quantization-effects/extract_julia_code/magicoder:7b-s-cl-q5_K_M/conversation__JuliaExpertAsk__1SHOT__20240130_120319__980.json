Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function to achieve this task:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code fences\n    m = eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, 1)\n    \n    # Initialize empty string to store the results\n    result = \"\"\n    \n    # Iterate over each match and append it to our final result\n    for code in m\n        result *= code.match\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression (`r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\") to find all the julia language code blocks in your markdown document `md`. The `.*?` part is a lazy match, meaning it will try and get as few characters as possible.\n\nAfter finding all of these blocks, this function appends them together with newlines (`\\n`) between each block (because every match includes the newline at the end) to create your final result.\n\nPlease make sure you test your markdown document before using it in this function. It is assumed that the provided markdown document `md` will have julia language code blocks that follow the standard markdown fence syntax and will include the keyword ```julia``` as per the markdown specification for fenced code blocks. If there are other ways to specify these code blocks, or if they use different syntax or keywords, you would need to adjust this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,328],"elapsed":2.953465426,"_type":"aimessage"}]
