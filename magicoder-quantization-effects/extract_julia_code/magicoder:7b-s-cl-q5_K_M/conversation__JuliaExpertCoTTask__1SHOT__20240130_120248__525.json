If it's a start, it extracts the content inside the fences (both inclusive), pushes that into an array `code_blocks`, and ignores any other lines. When it sees a new code block, it joins all elements in the `code_blocks` array with a newline character (`\"\\n\"`). If there is no end of julia code block found at all, then it returns nothing.","status":200,"tokens":[0,318],"elapsed":2.788150679,"_type":"aimessage"}]
