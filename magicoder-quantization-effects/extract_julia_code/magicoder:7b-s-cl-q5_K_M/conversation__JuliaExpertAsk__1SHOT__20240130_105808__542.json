Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Python version of the solution:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # Find all code blocks using regular expression\n    matches = re.findall(\"```.*?\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # Combine the found code blocks\n    combined_code = \"\\n\".join([match for match in matches])\n    \n    return combined_code\n```\nThe function extract_julia_code() uses a regular expression to find all the Julia code blocks. The `re.DOTALL` flag is used so that `.` can match any character including newlines. It then joins all found code blocks together with newline characters and returns the result as a string.\n\nPlease note, this assumes that your markdown document `md` does not contain any other fenced code blocks (not just Julia) and you want to consider all of them for extraction. If there are multiple languages or other kinds of fenced code blocks, more complex pattern matching may be required.","status":200,"tokens":[0,235],"elapsed":2.068639541,"_type":"aimessage"}]
