[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how this function could be implemented in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code = \"\"\n    inside_code_fence = false\n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        if startswith(line, \"```\") && !inside_code_fence\n            inside_code_fence = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && inside_code_fence\n            break\n        elseif inside_code_fence\n            code *= line[4:end-1] * \"\\n\"  # exclude the initial three backticks and the trailing newline if any\n        end\n    end\n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function works by reading through each line of the provided markdown document. If it encounters a line that starts with \"```\", it toggles a flag `inside_code_fence`. When `inside_code_fence` is true, it appends every subsequent line to `code`, excluding the initial three backticks and the trailing newline if any. After encountering another line starting with \"```\", it stops reading. It returns the concatenated code as a string without newlines.\n\nNote that this function assumes that there are no nested ```...```. If there could be, additional logic would need to be added to handle those correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,309],"elapsed":2.769663318,"_type":"aimessage"}]
