Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can create such a function:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    blocks = split(md, \"```julia\")\n    cleaned_blocks = [join(split(\"```julia\"*b), '\\n') for b in blocks[2:end]] # skip first block as it doesn't contain code\n    return join(cleaned_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function splits the markdown string into blocks using \"```julia\" as a separator. It then cleans each of these blocks by removing \"```julia\" at the start and end and joining all lines with newline character. Finally it joins all cleaned code blocks together with double newlines to get the desired output.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is exactly one code block for every \"```julia\". If the markdown document has multiple code blocks separated by different language markers (like \"```python\", \"```bash\"), you'll need a more complex solution.","status":200,"tokens":[0,241],"elapsed":2.119404678,"_type":"aimessage"}]
