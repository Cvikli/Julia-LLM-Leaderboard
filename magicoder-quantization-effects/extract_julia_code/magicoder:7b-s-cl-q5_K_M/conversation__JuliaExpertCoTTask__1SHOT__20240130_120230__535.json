Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The problem is to write a function in Julia that extracts all the code blocks from markdown, removes code fences and joins them with newline. Here's how you can solve it:\n\nFirst, we need to understand what a markdown document is and what a code block is. In Markdown language, a code block looks like this (between three backticks) : \n```\n ```\ncode goes here\n```\n```\nSo, our function will look for such blocks in the string (md), remove the fences (first three characters and last three characters of each block), and then join them together with a newline character.\n\nHere is the code:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all occurrences of a julia code block in md\n    regex = r\"```julia[\\s\\S]*?```\"\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(Regex(regex), md))\n    \n    # Remove the fences (first three characters and last three) from each match \n    stripped_matches = map(m -> m.match[4:end-3], matches)\n    \n    # Join all the code blocks with newline character\n    joined_code = join(stripped_matches, \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nThis function works by first using a regular expression to find all occurrences of a julia code block in md. It then strips off the code fences and joins all the blocks together with newline characters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,341],"elapsed":3.015204498,"_type":"aimessage"}]
