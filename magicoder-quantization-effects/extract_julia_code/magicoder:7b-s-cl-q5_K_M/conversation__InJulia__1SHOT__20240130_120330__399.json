Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution to your problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all matching blocks of lines starting with three backticks and ending with three backticks\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, capture=2)) \n    \n    if isempty(code_blocks)\n        return \"\"\n    else\n        # Combine all blocks into a single string\n        combined_code = join([strip(c) for c in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n        \n        # Remove code fences (triple backticks on both sides of the code block)\n        cleaned_code = replace(combined_code, \"```\" => \"\") \n        \n        return cleaned_code\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first uses regex to find all code blocks. The `eachmatch` function is used to return each match as a String. If no matches are found, it returns an empty array. We then join these into a single string. We use `strip` to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the code blocks. Then we replace each \"```\" with an empty string (effectively removing the code fences) and return the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,285],"elapsed":2.493148477,"_type":"aimessage"}]
