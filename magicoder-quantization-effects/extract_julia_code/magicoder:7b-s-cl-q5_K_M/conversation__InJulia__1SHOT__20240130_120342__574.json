Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String.

Add it to our list.\n                push!(code_blocks, join(current_lines, \"\\n\"))\n                current_lines = []  # Reset the lines array for the next block\n            end\n            \n            in_code_block = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && in_code_block == true\n            push!(code_blocks, join(current_lines, \"\\n\"))\n            current_lines = []  # Reset the lines array for the next block\n            \n            in_code_block = false\n        elseif in_code_block == true\n            # We're currently reading a code block. Add this line to our buffer.\n            push!(current_lines, line[4:end])  # Strip off the leading four spaces of the line.\n        end\n    end\n\n    if in_code_block\n        # We finished reading the last code block before the markdown document ended. Add it to our list.\n        push!(code_blocks, join(current_lines, \"\\n\"))\n    end\n    \n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")  # Join all blocks with double new lines\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each line in the markdown document. If it encounters a line that starts with \"```julia\" or just \"```\", it toggles the `in_code_block` flag and starts/stops collecting code into `current_lines`. The resulting Julia code is returned as a single string, with each block separated by two new lines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,505],"elapsed":4.447619848,"_type":"aimessage"}]
