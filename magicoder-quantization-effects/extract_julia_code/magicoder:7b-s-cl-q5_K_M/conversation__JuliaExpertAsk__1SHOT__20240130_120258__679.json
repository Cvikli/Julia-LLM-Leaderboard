Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function in Julia using regular expressions to match and extract the desired blocks of code:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\nusing REPL.REPLCompletions\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    md = replace(md, r\"^```.*?\\n\" => \"\", r\"\\n```$\" => \"\") # remove code fences\n    blocks = split(md, \"```julia\")\n    for i in 2:length(blocks)-1\n        if i != length(blocks)-1 && !isempty(blocks[i])  # not the last block and not empty\n            blocks[i] *= \"\\n\"   # add a newline to separate blocks of code\n        end\n    end\n    return join(blocks[2:end], \"\") # remove first element (empty string) and join the rest\nend\n```\n\nThis function works as follows:\n1. It removes all code fences using `replace(md, r\"^```.*?\\n\" => \"\", r\"\\n```$\" => \"\")`\n2. Then it splits the resulting text by ```julia to get individual blocks of code. The first split element is an empty string, so we start from index 2 in the resulting array of blocks.\n3. It then joins all but the last block with a newline (\\n). If there are multiple blocks it will keep them separate.\n4. Finally, it joins all blocks into one string and returns this string.\n\nThe regular expression `r\"^```.*?\\n\" => \"\", r\"\\n```$\"` is used to remove code fences. The \"^```\" means the beginning of a line followed by ```; `.*?` matches any number (but as few as possible due to *?) characters, and \\n matches newline. Similarly, `\\n```$` matches newline followed by ``` at end of line.\n\nThis function assumes that each code block is preceded by \"````\" for the opening code fence and followed by \"```\" for closing it. If your markdown uses different syntax to denote a code block (e.g., using three backticks), you would need to adjust the regular expressions accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,488],"elapsed":4.3233368,"_type":"aimessage"}]
