[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is your Python solution:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # find all julia code blocks\n    blocks = re.findall(r'```julia(.*?)```', md, re.DOTALL)\n\n    # remove the fences and join with newlines\n    return \"\\n\".join([block.strip() for block in blocks])\n```\nThis function uses regular expression to find all code blocks that contain `julia` language. It then removes the backticks (fences) from the code blocks and joins them together using a newline character.\n\nThis solution assumes the markdown document is properly formatted and there are no nested or escaped fenced code blocks in your document. The function will fail if that's not the case due to how the regular expression works. If you have such cases, you would need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[254,202],"elapsed":3.412568663,"_type":"aimessage"}]
