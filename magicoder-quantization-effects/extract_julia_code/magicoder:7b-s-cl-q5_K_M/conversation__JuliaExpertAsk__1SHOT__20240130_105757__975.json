Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Python solution for your problem:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # Regular expression to match julia code blocks\n    pattern = r'```julia\\n(.*?)```'\n    \n    # Find all matches of the regular expression in the markdown text\n    matches = re.findall(pattern, md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # Combine all matching groups into a single string with newline separator\n    code = \"\\n\".join(matches)\n    \n    return code\n```\n\nThis function uses Python's `re` module to find all matches of the regular expression in the markdown text. The regular expression `r'` ```julia\\n(.*?)```' matches any block of text surrounded by backticks, where the first line is \"```julia\" and the last line is ```\". The dot (`.`) inside the parentheses means to match anything at all, and ? makes it a non-greedy match. re.DOTALL means to make `.` also match newline characters.\n\nAfter finding all matches of the regular expression in the markdown text, the function then combines these into a single string with newline separator. This is done by calling the `join()` method on the list of matching groups (`matches`), and passing \"\\n\" as the delimiter. The result is returned by the function.\n\nNote: You need to be careful when using this function because it will join all the code blocks together without any specific order or hierarchy. If you want to keep the original order or hierarchical structure of the code blocks, you would have to modify this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,366],"elapsed":3.240311029,"_type":"aimessage"}]
