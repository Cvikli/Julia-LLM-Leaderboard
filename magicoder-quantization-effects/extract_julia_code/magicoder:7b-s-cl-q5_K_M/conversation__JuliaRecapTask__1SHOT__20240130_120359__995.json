[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can implement this function:\n```julia\nusing Markdown\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String \n    blocks = split(md, \"\\n```julia\")\n    code_blocks = []\n    for block in blocks[2:end]\n        lines = split(block, '\\n')\n        push!(code_blocks, join([lines[i][2:end-1] for i in 1:length(lines)], \"\\n\"))\n    end\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function splits the markdown string into blocks at each instance of '```julia'. It then processes each code block by removing the fences (the first and last line), and joining the remaining lines together. The processed code blocks are then joined back together to form a single string. \n\nIf you want to handle more specific cases such as correctly handling escaping within code fences or dealing with multiple code fenced language, it would be better to use a parser library like Parsers.jl that can parse and manipulate the Markdown syntax.","status":200,"tokens":[0,254],"elapsed":2.271995611,"_type":"aimessage"}]
