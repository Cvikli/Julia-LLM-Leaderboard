Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```python\nimport markdown2  # this is a Python library for converting Markdown to HTML\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    html = markdown2.markdown(md)\n    \n    # Use regular expressions to find all code blocks\n    import re\n    julia_blocks = re.findall('<pre><code class=\"language-julia\">(.*?)</code></pre>', html, re.DOTALL)\n\n    # Concatenate the code blocks into one string with a newline between each block\n    result = \"\\n\".join(julia_blocks)\n    \n    return result\n```\n\nThis function converts markdown to HTML and then uses regex to find all Julia language code blocks. It assumes that each Julia code block is within `<pre><code class=\"language-julia\">` tags in the HTML output, as this is standard for many markdown parsers when processing code blocks with different languages. The `re.DOTALL` flag ensures `.` matches any character including newlines. Finally, it concatenates all of the found Julia code blocks together into a single string and returns it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,256],"elapsed":2.244263973,"_type":"aimessage"}]
