[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is an example of how you could implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regex\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md, count=false))\n    \n    # Empty string to store extracted code\n    code = \"\"\n    \n    for match in matches\n        block = match.captures[1]\n        \n        # Remove code fences\n        block = replace(block, r\"^```julia\\n|\\n```$\" => \"\")\n        \n        # Join the blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline\n        if !isempty(code)\n            block = \"\\n\" * block\n        end\n        \n        code *= block\n    end\n    \n    return code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses Julia's built-in `collect` and `eachmatch` functions to find all occurrences of the code blocks in the markdown document. It then iterates over each match, removes the fenced code, joins them together with a newline if there are multiple, and finally returns the result as a string.\n\nRemember that this function assumes that your markdown file only contains one type of code block (````julia...```), not mixed types of blocks (i.e., some marked up in `julia` while others are marked up as something else). If you expect mixed types, you'll need to adjust the regular expression and add additional logic to handle it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,350],"elapsed":3.065968447,"_type":"aimessage"}]
