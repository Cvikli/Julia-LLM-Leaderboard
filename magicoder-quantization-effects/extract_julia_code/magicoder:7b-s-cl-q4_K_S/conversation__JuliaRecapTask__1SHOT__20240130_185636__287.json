[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function written in Julia that accomplishes this task:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find the code blocks\n    codeblocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md,  greedy=false))\n    \n    if isempty(codeblocks)\n        return \"\"\n    end\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join the blocks together with a newline\n    result = reduce((x, y)-> x * \"\\n\" * y.match[1], map(x->replace(x.match[1], r\"```julia\\n\", \"\"), codeblocks))\n    \n    return String(result)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to match and extract the Julia code blocks from the markdown string. It then removes the fences surrounding each block of code and concatenates them together with newline characters between each block. The result is a single string containing all the Julia code from the markdown document, without any additional formatting or structure.\n\nKeep in mind that this function assumes that there are no nested code blocks within other code blocks, as Markdown does not support nested fenced code blocks. If your input can contain nested code blocks, you would need to adjust the regular expression and/or the logic of the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,301],"elapsed":2.408882019,"_type":"aimessage"}]
