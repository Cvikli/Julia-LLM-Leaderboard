[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how this function could be written in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Split the markdown document into blocks\n    blocks = split(md, \"\\n\\n---\\n\\n\")\n\n    # Initialize result as empty string\n    result = \"\"\n\n    for block in blocks\n        # Check if the block starts with a code fence ( ``` )\n        if occursin(\"```\", block)\n            # Remove first and last line, which contain the code fences\n            block_stripped = strip(block[4:end-3])\n            # Add newline to result between different blocks\n            result *= \"\\n\" * block_stripped\n        elseif !isempty(result)\n            # If a non-code block follows another code block, add an extra newline\n            result *= \"\\n\" \n        end\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the markdown document into blocks using the \"---\" separator and then iterating over each block. It checks if the current block contains a code fence ( ``` ). If it does, it removes the first and last line which contain these code fences and adds the resulting stripped block to the result string.\n\nNote: The function assumes that every Julia language code block starts with \"```\" and ends with \"```\", and each block is separated by a line containing only \"---\". The stripping operation removes leading or trailing whitespace, but does not remove any other formatting within the code block.","status":200,"tokens":[0,348],"elapsed":2.690815142,"_type":"aimessage"}]
