Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can write such function in Julia:\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Parse the markdown\n    parsed = parse(Markdown.Parser(), md, flavor=Markdown.Flavors.github())\n\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown\n    code_blocks = filter(x -> x isa Markdown.CodeBlock, parsed.content)\n    \n    # Concatenate the content of all code blocks into a single string, \n    # removing any leading or trailing whitespace and newlines\n    return join([replace(x.language, \"julia\"=>\"\"), replace(strip(x.code), \"\\n\" => \"\", leading = false)]..., \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function works by parsing the Markdown document into an AbstractSyntaxTree (AST) using a parser, then filtering out non-CodeBlock elements and concatenating all CodeBlock codes together with a newline in between. This way, code blocks from different parts of the markdown are joined together. It also takes care of removing any leading or trailing whitespace and newlines from each code block. The function assumes that \"julia\" is the language for Julia code blocks in GitHub flavored Markdown. If this does not apply to your case, you will need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,299],"elapsed":2.303427468,"_type":"aimessage"}]
