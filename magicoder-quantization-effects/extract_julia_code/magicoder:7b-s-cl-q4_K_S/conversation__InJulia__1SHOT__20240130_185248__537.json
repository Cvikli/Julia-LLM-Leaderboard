It then iterates over each line in the document, looking for lines that contain a `code fence` (i.e., those that start with ```julia). When it encounters one of these lines, it knows to treat all subsequent lines as code until it encounters another `code fence`. \n\nAny lines of code found are appended to a variable called `code`, with any leading spaces (which would be present if the code was split across multiple lines in the markdown) removed. If a new `code fence` is encountered, a newline is added before it.\n\nWhen all lines have been processed, the function returns the resulting code block. This is a string containing all of the julia code blocks found within the markdown document.","status":200,"tokens":[0,376],"elapsed":2.905570838,"_type":"aimessage"}]
