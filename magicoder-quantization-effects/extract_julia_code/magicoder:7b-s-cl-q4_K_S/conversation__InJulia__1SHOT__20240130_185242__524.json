Then we join these blocks together with newline character (`\"\\n\"`) using `join`. Finally, we remove the code fences from each block via slicing `[3:end-3]`. If there are no matches (indicated by `m === nothing`), an empty string is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,275],"elapsed":2.114671017,"_type":"aimessage"}]
