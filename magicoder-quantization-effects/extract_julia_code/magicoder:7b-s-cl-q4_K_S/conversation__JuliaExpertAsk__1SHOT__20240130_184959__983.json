Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is a Python solution for your problem:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    code_blocks = re.findall('```.*?\\n(.*?)\\n```', md, re.DOTALL)  # find all code blocks with ```...```\n    \n    return \"\\n\".join(code_blocks)  # join the code blocks together with a newline\n```\nIn this Python function, `re.findall` is used to find all occurrences of strings that match the regular expression in `md`. The regular expression `'```.*?\\n(.*?)\\n```'` matches any text between three backticks (```), where `.*?\\n` matches any character (greedy) until a newline character `\\n`, and `(.*?)` captures the content of the code block. The `re.DOTALL` flag is used to make dot in regular expression match any character including new line characters. \n\nPlease note, it assumes that the input `md` contains only julia language code blocks surrounded by three backticks (```), and does not handle cases where code fences are not present or misplaced. For handling those cases, you might need to preprocess the string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,277],"elapsed":2.147383478,"_type":"aimessage"}]
