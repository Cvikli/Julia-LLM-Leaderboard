[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

It then joins all matched code blocks into one string with newline characters between each block. \n\nNote: This code assumes that markdown code fences are used to delineate code blocks, where `julia` is specified after the opening fence. The `.*` in the regular expression matches any character (except for a newline), and the `?` makes it non-greedy, so it stops matching as soon as possible instead of going all the way to the end of the match. \n\nIf the markdown doesn't use these conventions or if there are multiple code blocks in one block that need to be extracted separately, this function would have to be modified accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,353],"elapsed":2.722998159,"_type":"aimessage"}]
