[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is a simple solution using regular expressions to find and extract all Julia code blocks from markdown:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Regular expression pattern for finding julia blocks\n    p = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n    \n    # Extract all julia code blocks and remove backticks and linebreaks\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(p, md))\n    joined_code = reduce((x, y) -> x * \"\\n\" * match(r\"\\n(.*?)\\n\", y)[1], [match[1] for match in matches])\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `eachmatch` function to find all matches of the regular expression pattern. The pattern `\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s matches a string that starts with \"```julia\\n\", ends with \"\\n```\", and captures everything in between as match[1]. It then reduces these matched strings into one big string.\n\nThis function assumes that there are no nested code blocks or any other special markdown features that it needs to handle, which may not be the case for all markdown files. For more robust handling of complex markdown structures, a parser would be necessary and this solution would be considerably more complicated.","status":200,"tokens":[0,300],"elapsed":2.433396324,"_type":"aimessage"}]
