[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can create the function:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    ast = parse(Markdown.Parser(), md, flavor=Markdown.Flavors.github())\n    blocks = Markdown.findall(ast, Markdown.Code)\n    \n    codes = [strip(c.language, leading=false, trailing=true)*\"\\n\"*escape_string(c.code) for c in blocks]\n    \n    return join(codes, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThe `Markdown.Parser()` function parses the markdown into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). `parse` then converts this AST to a concrete structure. In this case, it will be a list of blocks, where each block is a tuple representing one part of the Markdown document. `findall(ast, Markdown.Code)` returns all code blocks in the parsed markdown.\n\nThe function `extract_julia_code` then loops over these code blocks and extracts the language (if there's any) and the actual code content. It escapes the code content to make sure it does not contain any special characters that could break the joining process. Finally, all the codes are joined together with a newline character in between.\n\nPlease note that you need `Markdown` package for this function to work. You can install it using: `Pkg.add(\"Markdown\")`","status":200,"tokens":[0,324],"elapsed":2.502767108,"_type":"aimessage"}]
