[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"This problem requires knowledge of regular expressions and string manipulation in Julia to extract all code from markdown files that contain julia blocks.\n\nHere's an example solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Convert the markdown file into a document object\n    doc = parse(md, \"file.jl\")\n    \n    # Extract all code blocks from the document\n    codes = filter(x -> x.language == \"julia\", findall(Code(\"\"), doc))\n    \n    # Join the found code blocks together and return the resultant string\n    join([string(c.code) for c in codes], \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nIn this function, we first parse the markdown document using `parse` which returns a list of blocks in the document. We then filter out all Code blocks that are written in Julia (i.e., where `.language == \"julia\"`). Finally, we join all these code snippets together with newlines and return the result.\n\nThis function assumes you've already installed the `Markdown` package for parsing markdown files. If not, it can be added via the command `Pkg.add(\"Markdown\")` in Julia's package manager.","status":200,"tokens":[0,284],"elapsed":2.311232147,"_type":"aimessage"}]
