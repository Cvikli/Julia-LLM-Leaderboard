[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The function `extract_julia_code` can be written in Julia using Regex to match and extract the Julia code blocks from the Markdown document:\n\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using regex pattern\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```(.*?)```\", md, flags = re.DOTALL))\n    \n    # Check if there are multiple Julia code blocks\n    if length(code_blocks) > 1\n        return join([replace(m[1], \"```\" => \"\") for m in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n    elseif length(code_blocks) == 1\n        # Remove backticks from the single code block and return it as a String\n        return replace(code_blocks[1][1], \"```\" => \"\")\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function takes in a Markdown document string `md` and returns the Julia code joined together with newline characters, or just the Julia code if there is only one block. The regex pattern `r\"```(.*?)```\", combined with the flags `re.DOTALL`, matches any text between backticks (```` ````), including newlines due to the `re.DOTALL` flag.\n\nThe function uses the built-in Julia library `RegularExpressions`. The pattern `.*?` makes sure that it doesn't match too much (since `.*` is greedy), and the parentheses around it are for capturing groups.","status":200,"tokens":[0,348],"elapsed":2.789237325,"_type":"aimessage"}]
