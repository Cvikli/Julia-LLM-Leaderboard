Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple function in Julia that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find code blocks and remove them\n    md = replace(md, r\"^```.*?\\n(.*?)^\\1$\"mg => \"\", \n                   r\"\\`\\`\\`\\n(.*?)\\n\\`\\`\\`\"mg => \"\")\n\n    # Get all code blocks as an array\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia.*?\\n(.*?)^\\1$\", md, \n                               start=1))\n\n    # Join the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline\n    result = join([m.captures[1] for m in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n\n    return result\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to find and replace markdown code fences with an empty string. It then collects all matches (code blocks) into an array and joins them together into a single string with a newline character as the separator. The result is a string containing all the code from the original markdown document, but without any code fences.","status":200,"tokens":[0,273],"elapsed":2.131055706,"_type":"aimessage"}]
