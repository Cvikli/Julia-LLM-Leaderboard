Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of a function that accomplishes this:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    blocks = map(Markdown.parse, split(md, \"\\n```\\n\"))  # split markdown document into code blocks\n    filter!(b -> b.head == :code, blocks)   # remove non-code blocks\n    join([string(b.args[1]) for b in blocks], '\\n')   # join code blocks with newline\nend\n```\nThe `extract_julia_code` function works by splitting the Markdown document into separate parts around each Julia code block, then filtering out any blocks that aren't actually code (`:code`). It finally joins all remaining code blocks together with a newline.","status":200,"tokens":[0,176],"elapsed":1.356175885,"_type":"aimessage"}]
