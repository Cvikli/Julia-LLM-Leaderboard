[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can implement this using regular expressions in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # regex pattern to match the code blocks\n    regex = r\"```julia(.+?)```\"s\n    \n    # find all matches in the markdown string\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(regex, md))\n    \n    # concatenate the matched code blocks into a single string\n    code_blocks = join([match.captures[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\n\n    # remove leading/trailing whitespace and return the result\n    return trim(code_blocks)\nend\n```\nThis function works by first defining a regex pattern that will match all Julia code blocks in the markdown document. Then it finds all matches to this pattern, which are stored as Match objects with a Captures field. The Captures field contains an array of matched substrings for each capturing group in the regex pattern. In this case, there's only one capturing group (denoted by the parentheses), so we're interested in Captures[1], which corresponds to the text inside the code block.\n\nFinally, it concatenates all these strings into a single string with newlines between them. The `trim` function is used to remove leading and trailing whitespace from each line of the resulting code block.","status":200,"tokens":[0,302],"elapsed":2.420224165,"_type":"aimessage"}]
