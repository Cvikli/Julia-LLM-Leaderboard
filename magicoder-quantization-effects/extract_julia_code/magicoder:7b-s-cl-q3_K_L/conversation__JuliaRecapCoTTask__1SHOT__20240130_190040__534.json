[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you might write this function using the `Markdown` package in Julia:\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    blocks = Markdown.parse(md) |> collect\n    codes = String[]\n    for block in blocks\n        if typeof(block) <: AbstractBlockQuote && length(block.contents) == 1 &&\n           typeof(block.contents[1]) == CodeBlock &&\n           occursin(\"julia\", block.contents[1].language)\n            push!(codes, block.contents[1].code |> string)\n        end\n    end\n    join(codes, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `Markdown` package's parsing capabilities to go through each element in the document. It then checks if each element is a code block and if it contains \"julia\" as its language. If both conditions are true, it extracts the code from the code block and adds it to the list of codes found so far. Finally, it joins all the codes together with newline characters and returns the result.\n\nPlease note that this function only considers blocks which have a single `CodeBlock` as their content and whose language includes \"julia\". If your use case requires different behavior you will need to adjust this code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,296],"elapsed":2.429467964,"_type":"aimessage"}]
