Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String.

The `.*?` part means \"match anything (but don't be greedy) until\", and `'` denotes the start/end of a code block. We then join these matched strings with spaces and remove newline characters with `replace('\\n', '')`. If no matches are found, we return an empty string.\n\nPlease adapt this approach to Julia if necessary.","status":200,"tokens":[0,235],"elapsed":1.871355638,"_type":"aimessage"}]
