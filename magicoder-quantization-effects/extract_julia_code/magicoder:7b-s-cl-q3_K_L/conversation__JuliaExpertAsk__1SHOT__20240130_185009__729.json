Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of such function in Julia programming language:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    start = r\"^```julia\"\n    end_ = r\"```$\"\n    match = eachmatch(Regex(start * \".*?\" * end_, \"s\"), md)\n    code_blocks = [m.match for m in match]\n    \n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `eachmatch` function to find all matches of Julia code blocks in the markdown document. It then joins them into a single string with newlines between each block using `join`. \n\nThe regular expressions used are as follows:\n- `^```julia`: This looks for the start of a Julia code block, assuming that it is at the beginning of a line (denoted by `^` and `.*?` makes the match non-greedy).\n- `.*?`: This is the part of the regular expression that matches all characters between the start and end of the code block until the end mark is found. It's a non-greedy match, so it stops consuming characters as soon as possible to avoid including everything in the last code block. \n- ````$`: This looks for the end of a Julia code block. Note that `$` matches the end of the line, so this will only find code blocks if they are followed by a newline character (which is what markdown usually does).","status":200,"tokens":[0,335],"elapsed":2.692482701,"_type":"aimessage"}]
