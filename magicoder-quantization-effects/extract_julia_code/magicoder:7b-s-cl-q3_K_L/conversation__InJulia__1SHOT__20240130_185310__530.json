[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can achieve this by using regular expressions to find the blocks of Julia code. Here is one way to write `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks with regex\n    code_blocks = collect.(eachmatch(r\"```julia.*?\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n\n    # If there are multiple blocks, join them together with a newline\n    if length(code_blocks) > 1\n        return join(map(strip, code_blocks), \"\\n\")\n    else\n        return first(code_blocks)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first extracts all the code blocks from the input markdown document. It uses a regular expression to find these blocks - ```julia.*?\\n(.*?)\\n```. The `.*?` in the regex makes it non-greedy, so that multiple matches are not combined into one long match.\n\nThen, if there are more than one code block, it joins them together with a newline. If there is only one code block, it returns this single block directly. \n\nFinally, `strip` function is used to remove leading and trailing whitespaces in the extracted code blocks. The resulting string contains all the Julia code from the input markdown document, joined together with newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[122,313],"elapsed":6.793126456,"_type":"aimessage"}]
