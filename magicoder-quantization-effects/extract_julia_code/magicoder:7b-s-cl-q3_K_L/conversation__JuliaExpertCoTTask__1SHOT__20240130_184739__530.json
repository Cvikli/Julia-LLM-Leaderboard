Whenever it encounters a line that starts with ``` (indicating the start of a code block), it begins to append lines until it encounters another line starting with ``` (the end of the current code block). It then adds this block to a list, and continues on to the next code block. Once all code blocks are found, it joins them together into one string separated by newlines (`\\n\\n`) and returns this string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,313],"elapsed":2.537364631,"_type":"aimessage"}]
