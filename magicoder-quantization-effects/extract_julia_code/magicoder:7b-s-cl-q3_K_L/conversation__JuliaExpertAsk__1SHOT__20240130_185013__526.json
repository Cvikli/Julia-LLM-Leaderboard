[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise.

Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is the function `extract_julia_code()` that fulfills your requirements. The function uses regex to find markdown code fences, then use those to extract and join Julia language code blocks.\n\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia.*?\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    if length(code_blocks) > 0\n        # Join the blocks together with a newline and remove extra newlines\n        joined_code = replace(join(code_blocks[i][.match] for i in 1:length(code_blocks)), \"\\n\\n\" => \"\\n\")\n        \n        return joined_code\n    else\n        return \"\"\n    end\nend\n```\nThe `eachmatch` function is used to find all instances of the regex pattern, which matches markdown code fences. The `.match` property is used to extract the matched substring. \n\nPlease note that this function will not work correctly if there are nested code blocks or any other complications in the input markdown document. For more complex cases, you would need a more sophisticated approach, possibly using a markdown parsing library or another language processing tool.","status":200,"tokens":[0,301],"elapsed":2.408115646,"_type":"aimessage"}]
