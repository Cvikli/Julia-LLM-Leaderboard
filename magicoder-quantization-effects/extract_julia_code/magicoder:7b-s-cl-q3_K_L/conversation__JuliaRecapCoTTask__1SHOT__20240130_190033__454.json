[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

We'll also make use of the `replace` function from the Base library and an anonymous function to join all the code blocks together with a newline character. \n\nHere is a possible solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString; instructions::Union{Nothing, AbstractString} = nothing)\n    # Define the regular expression for matching Julia language code blocks in markdown\n    re = r\"^```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```$\"sms\n    \n    # Use the findall function to collect all matches into a vector of strings\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(re, md, context=Compile.Context()))\n    blocks = String[]\n    \n    if isnothing(matches) || isempty(matches) \n        return \"\"\n    end\n    \n    for match in matches\n        # Join all matched strings into a single string\n        block_code = join(match, \"\\n\")\n        \n        # If there are special instructions provided, we replace them with the corresponding block of code\n        if !isnothing(instructions) && !isempty(instructions)\n            instruction_match = match[1]\n            if occursin(instruction_match, instructions) \n                block_code = string(\"begin\\n\", block_code, \"\\nend\")\n            end\n        end\n        \n        # Append the code block to our vector\n        push!(blocks, block_code)\n    end\n    \n    # Join all blocks together with a newline and return the result\n    return join(blocks, \"\\n\\n\") \nend\n```\n\nThis function first uses regex to match the markdown code blocks. If no matches are found or if there aren't any code blocks in the provided document, an empty string is returned. Otherwise, it iterates through each matched block and checks whether special instructions are present. It then appends this block of code (possibly with additional enclosing begin/end statements) to the list `blocks`. Finally, it joins all blocks together with a newline character and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,485],"elapsed":3.979883631,"_type":"aimessage"}]
