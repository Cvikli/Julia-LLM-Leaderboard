[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple solution using Julia's Regex library to match markdown code fences, and `replace` function to remove them:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document.\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```(.*?)```\", md, seed=1))\n\n    if isempty(code_blocks)\n        return \"\"\n    elseif length(code_blocks) == 1\n        # If there's only one block of code, remove the fences and newline.\n        return replace(code_blocks[1].match, r\"```\\n\" => \"\")\n    else\n        # If there are multiple blocks of code, join them with a newline.\n        return join([replace(block.match, r\"```\\n\" => \"\") for block in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function will work correctly if the markdown document has only one or multiple code blocks of Julia code. If there are other languages mixed with Julia code inside these fences, they may be treated as separate code blocks and concatenated together. This might need additional parsing to differentiate between different programming languages.","status":200,"tokens":[0,285],"elapsed":2.402361504,"_type":"aimessage"}]
