[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can write `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    result = \"\"\n    inCodeBlock = false\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```\")\n            inCodeBlock = !inCodeBlock  # toggle code block status\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if inCodeBlock && !startswith(line, \" \")\n            result *= \"\\n\" * line\n        elseif inCodeBlock && startswith(line, \" \")\n            result *= line[2:end]\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return result[2:end]  # remove leading newline character\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the input markdown string into lines and iterating over each line. If it encounters a line with three backticks (```), it toggles `inCodeBlock` flag which is used to track whether we're in a code block or not. It then checks if we're currently inside a code block, and if so, appends the current line stripping off any leading whitespace. If you want to keep the newline at the end of each code block, just remove `[2:end]` part when concatenating `result`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,301],"elapsed":2.494257839,"_type":"aimessage"}]
