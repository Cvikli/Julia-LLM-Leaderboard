[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of the function `extract_julia_code` in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Find all code blocks and store them in a list\n    code_blocks = [collect(line) for line in split(md, \"\\n\") if startswith(line, \"```julia\")]\n    \n    # Remove code fences from each block\n    for i in 1:length(code_blocks)\n        code_blocks[i] = code_blocks[i][4:-2]\n    end\n\n    # Join all blocks into one string with newline characters\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function works by first splitting the markdown file by lines and then checking if each line starts with \"```julia\". If a line does start with this, it is assumed to be a code block. These blocks are stored in a list (`code_blocks`). The code fences (the \"```\" parts) are removed from each block and the blocks are joined into one string with newline characters.\n\nPlease note that if your markdown document uses different code fencing sequences or if it has multi-line code blocks, this function may not work correctly. For more advanced parsing, consider using a specialized Markdown parser library in Julia like MK.jl.","status":200,"tokens":[0,309],"elapsed":2.617375256,"_type":"aimessage"}]
