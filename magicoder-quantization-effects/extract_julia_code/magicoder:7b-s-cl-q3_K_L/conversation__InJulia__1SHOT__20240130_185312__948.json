The re.DOTALL flag allows the dot (.) to match every character, including newlines.\n\nThen we join all of these blocks together with a newline (\\n), remove the code fences by replacing '```', and return this combined string. \n\nThis function assumes that each Julia code block is on its own line, surrounded by three backticks (```julia ... ```). If your markdown document uses different syntax or has other requirements, you may need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,283],"elapsed":2.253955921,"_type":"aimessage"}]
