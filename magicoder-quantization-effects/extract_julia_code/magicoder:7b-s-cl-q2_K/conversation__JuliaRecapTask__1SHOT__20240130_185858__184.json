[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could write the function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\") # split the markdown into lines\n    \n    codeblocks = String[]  # to store all the julia blocks found\n    in_codeblock = false  # flag to indicate whether we're in a code block or not\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\") \n            in_codeblock = true  # start of new code block\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && !in_codeblock\n            break  # end of the document or next non-code part\n        elseif in_codeblock \n            append!(codeblocks, line[5:end])  # append content of code block into result\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(codeblocks, \"\\n\") # join all blocks together with newline\nend\n```\nThis function will work as follows: it starts by splitting the input string `md` into lines. For each line in this split, it checks if the line is a start of Julia code block (`\"<!-- language-id: julia -->\"`). If it is, it switches to a new code block and continues adding the rest of the current block and all subsequent blocks.\n\nAfter checking all the lines, it joins the parts found in code blocks into one string separated by newline character (\"\\n\").\n\nNote that this function does not handle multiple consecutive code blocks, and may also not work as expected for more complex markdown documents with nested code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[0,368],"elapsed":2.831554307,"_type":"aimessage"}]
