[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple solution using regular expressions in Python to extract and join Julia code blocks from a markdown document:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # find all julia code blocks\n    blocks = re.findall(r'```julia(.+?)````', md, re.DOTALL)\n\n    if not blocks: \n        return \"\"\n    \n    # remove code fences and join blocks together with a newline\n    code = \"\\n\".join([b.strip() for b in blocks])\n    return code\n```\n\nThis function will extract all the Julia code blocks from the markdown document, remove the code fences around them (and leading/trailing white spaces), and then join these blocks together with a newline. Note that `re.DOTALL` flag is used so that `.+?` will match any character, including newlines.\n\nThis function assumes that every Julia block ends with two backticks (```), and does not handle nested code blocks (i.e., ones within other code blocks). If there are nested code blocks in the document, this function may need to be modified accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[254,259],"elapsed":4.515737213,"_type":"aimessage"}]
