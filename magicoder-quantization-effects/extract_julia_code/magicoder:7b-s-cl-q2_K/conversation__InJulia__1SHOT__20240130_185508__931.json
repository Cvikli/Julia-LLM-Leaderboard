Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String.

After joining all of these blocks together, it will return a string containing all the extracted and joined code. \n\nPlease note that if there are multiple consecutive code blocks without any text or whitespace separating them, this function may not work correctly due to how regular expressions work. In such case, you would need to handle the text in between separately.","status":200,"tokens":[0,268],"elapsed":2.073218685,"_type":"aimessage"}]
