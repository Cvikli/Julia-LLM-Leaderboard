Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's how you can define such function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks using the markdown syntax.\n    # Assume that each block starts with ``` and ends with ```\n    blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```(.*?\\n(?:(?:.*\\n)*?)```\", md, seed=1))).captures\n    \n    # Remove the code fences (``` marks) from each block.\n    cleaned_blocks = [replace(b[1], r\"^`*|`*$\", \"\") for b in blocks]\n    \n    # Join the blocks together with a newline\n    return join([c for c in cleaned_blocks if !isempty(c)], \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to match the code blocks and then remove the surrounding ``` marks from each block. Note that it uses the `eachmatch` function to find all matches of the pattern, which is more efficient than using a loop for large strings. The result is an array of String where each element is a cleaned version of one code block. Then we use the `join` function to combine these blocks into a single string with newline characters between blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[122,282],"elapsed":12.638889243,"_type":"aimessage"}]
