[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how we can solve this problem using regular expressions in Python, which has excellent support for string manipulation tasks such as extracting code blocks from a markdown document:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # regex pattern to match the code block in markdown format\n    pattern = r'```(.*?)\\n(.*?)```'\n    matches = re.findall(pattern, md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    if len(matches) == 0:\n        return \"\"\n\n    # join all matched code blocks with a newline in between\n    return \"\\n\".join([match[1] for match in matches])\n```\n\nThis function `extract_julia_code` accepts the markdown document as input, uses regular expressions to find all the code blocks, and then joins them together. It skips over any code block that does not have 2 groups separated by newline characters. The reason for this is to handle possible errors in the markdown where there might be extra newlines or missing lines within a code block.","status":200,"tokens":[422,242],"elapsed":7.242100333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
