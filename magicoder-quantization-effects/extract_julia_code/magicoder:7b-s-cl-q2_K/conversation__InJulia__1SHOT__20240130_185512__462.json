The `.DOTALL` flag makes `re.findall()` also match newlines, allowing us to capture multiple code blocks at once.\n\nPlease note that for the Python version and Julia version, the function will not return anything if there are no code blocks in the input string. If you want a default value when there are no matches, you can modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,223],"elapsed":1.699805205,"_type":"aimessage"}]
