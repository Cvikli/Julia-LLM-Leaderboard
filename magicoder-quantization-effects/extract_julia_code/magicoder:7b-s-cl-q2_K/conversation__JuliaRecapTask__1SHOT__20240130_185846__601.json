[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that solves this problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    code = r\"^```.*?\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(code, md, 1))\n    if length(matches) > 0\n        join([m.match for m in matches], \"\\n\") * \"\\n\"\n    else\n        \"\"\n    end\nend\n```\nThe function `extract_julia_code` uses a regular expression to match all the code blocks in the markdown document, then it joins them together with a newline character. Note that this assumes that you have already stripped out any other language specific syntax (like R or Python). The above implementation also assumes that there are no nested ``` ``` fences. \n\nIf you need to handle multiple languages, you might consider using a more sophisticated method of parsing the markdown such as a full parser that supports different syntax for each block in your language.","status":200,"tokens":[0,227],"elapsed":1.745992701,"_type":"aimessage"}]
