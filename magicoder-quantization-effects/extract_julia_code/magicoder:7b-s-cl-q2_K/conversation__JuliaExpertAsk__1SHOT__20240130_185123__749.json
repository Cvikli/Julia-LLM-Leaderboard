Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the implementation for this problem in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    inblock = false\n    code = \"\"\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if contains(line, \"```\")\n            # Start or end of a block.\n            if !inblock && !isempty(code)\n                # Add newline between blocks.\n                code *= \"\\n\"\n            end\n            inblock = !inblock\n        elseif inblock && line != \"\" \n            # If it's not an empty line (not just a newline), append to the block.\n            if endswith(code, \"\\n\")\n                # Remove trailing newline if there is one before appending the new line.\n                code = code[1:end-1] * line \n            else\n                code *= line\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the markdown string into lines, and for each line checking if it's part of a code block. If it is, we add it to our `code` variable, removing any trailing newlines before appending. \n\nAfter parsing all the lines, the function returns the final concatenated code block as a String. This will contain all the Julia language code blocks joined together, with each separate block separated by newline characters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,318],"elapsed":2.402380506,"_type":"aimessage"}]
