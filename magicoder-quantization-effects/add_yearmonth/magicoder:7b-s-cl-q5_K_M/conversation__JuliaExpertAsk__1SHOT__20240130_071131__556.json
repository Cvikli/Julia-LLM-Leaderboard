The value of the new column is computed by mapping over each element in the `dt` column, extracting the year and month from the DateTime object using the `year` and `month` functions, respectively. The resulting year and month are then concatenated into an integer string in format “yyyymm”.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[Date(2018, 10, 3), Date(2019, 5, 6)], \n               a=[\"x\", \"y\"], \n               b=[3.2, 4.5])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will create the new column `ym` in the DataFrame df.","status":200,"tokens":[0,258],"elapsed":2.19010061,"_type":"aimessage"}]
