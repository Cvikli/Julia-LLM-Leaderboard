This function uses DataFrames.jl package, which enables dealing with data frames in Julia.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = [Date(i).year*100 + Date(i).month for i in df[:dt]]\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, `df` is your input DataFrame and `:dt` is the column of date-times. The new column `:ym` will be created with year-month concatenated as integers. \n\nPlease note that you need to install and import the necessary packages (like DataFrames.jl) before running these codes in your Julia environment. You can do this by adding `using Pkg; Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\"); using DataFrames` at the top of your script.","status":200,"tokens":[0,203],"elapsed":1.775331648,"_type":"aimessage"}]
