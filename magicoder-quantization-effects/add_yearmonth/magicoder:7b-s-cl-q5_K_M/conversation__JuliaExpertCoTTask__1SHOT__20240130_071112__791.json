Here is a function that accomplishes this:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = Dates.format.([d for d in df[:dt]], \"yyyymm\") |> x -> parse.(Int, split(x, \"\")) .|> sum\nend\n```\nThis function first transforms the DateTime values into strings with month and year only using the `Dates.format` function. Then it converts these string representations to integers by splitting them into individual characters (`split(x, \"\")`) and converting each character to an integer (`parse.(Int, ...)`). Finally, it sums up the resulting array of digits, which represents the year and month combined as a single number in the format \"yyyymm\".\n\nTo use this function with your data:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will create a new column `ym` in the dataframe `df`. Note that this function assumes that all dates in the `dt` column are valid and compatible with the format string used.","status":200,"tokens":[0,316],"elapsed":2.788095216,"_type":"aimessage"}]
