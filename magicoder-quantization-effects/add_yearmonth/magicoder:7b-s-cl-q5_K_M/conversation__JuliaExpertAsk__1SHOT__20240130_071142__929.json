The values of this new column are generated from the original date-time column (`df[:dt]`). The format \"yyyyMM\" is used, which represents year and month in four-digit and two-digit formats respectively.\n\nPlease note that this function modifies the input dataframe `df` directly. Also, make sure you've added `Dates` module to your code as it is necessary for date manipulations in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[0,185],"elapsed":1.557470674,"_type":"aimessage"}]
