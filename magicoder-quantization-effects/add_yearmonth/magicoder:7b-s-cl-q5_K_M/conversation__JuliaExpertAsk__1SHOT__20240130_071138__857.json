I defined a function `add_yearmonth` that extracts year and month from each date in 'dt' column using datetime module and concatenates them into new column 'ym'. After defining this function, I called it to update my original DataFrame df with the new column 'ym'.\n\nPlease note this code is written for Python but can be easily translated to Julia or any other language that supports similar operations. The key point here is extracting date and time from a string in 'yyyy-mm-dd' format and formatting it as an integer in 'yyyymm' format.","status":200,"tokens":[0,334],"elapsed":2.806148787,"_type":"aimessage"}]
