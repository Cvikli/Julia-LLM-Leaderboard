[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

After that, you can just concatenate them together using string interpolation (`*`). Here's how:\n\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = [string(year(dt), lpad(month(dt), 2, '0')) for dt in df.dt]\nend\n```\nIn this function, `lpad` pads the month with zeros if it's a single digit month (e.g., January -> \"01\", February -> \"02\"). \n\nPlease note that you need to pass your DataFrame as an argument to the `add_yearmonth` function. This function modifies the passed DataFrame in-place, so there is no return value. The new column `ym` containing year and month information will be added to your DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,211],"elapsed":1.71025722,"_type":"aimessage"}]
