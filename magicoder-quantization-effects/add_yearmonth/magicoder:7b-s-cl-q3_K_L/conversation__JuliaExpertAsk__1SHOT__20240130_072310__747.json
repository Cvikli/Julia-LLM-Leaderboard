It uses the `Dates.format()` function to extract this information and then concatenate it into one string. The DataFrame column indexer `df[:]` is used to refer to all columns of the DataFrame.\n\nUsage example:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=DateTime[now()+Month(i) for i in 1:10])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will add a new column `ym` to `df` containing the year and month of each DateTime in the `dt` column.","status":200,"tokens":[0,228],"elapsed":1.825688672,"_type":"aimessage"}]
