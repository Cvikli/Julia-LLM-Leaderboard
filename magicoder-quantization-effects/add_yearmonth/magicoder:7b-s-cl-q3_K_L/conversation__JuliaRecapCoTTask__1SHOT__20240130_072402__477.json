[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

The function `yearmonth` from `Dates` module will get you the year and month components separately, then just concatenate them as integers. Here is how it could be done:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = [DateFormat(\"y\")(d) * 100 + DateFormat(\"m\")(d) for d in df.dt]\nend\n```\nThis function takes a `DataFrame` as input and adds a new column `ym` to it. The content of the new column is calculated by extracting year and month from each date time in the `dt` column, then concatenating them together as an integer format \"yyyymm\". \n\nPlease note that you need to use `DataFrames.jl`, `Dates.jl` in your project to run this function smoothly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,215],"elapsed":1.805094957,"_type":"aimessage"}]
