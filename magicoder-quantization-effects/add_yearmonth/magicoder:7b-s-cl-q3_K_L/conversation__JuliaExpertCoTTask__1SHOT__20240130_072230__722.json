Specifically, you can use the `Year` and `Month` functions from DataFrames.jl to extract the year and month from your DateTime object, then concatenate them into a new column. Here is how:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = string.(Dates.Year(df[:dt])) .* string.(Dates.Month(df[:dt]))\nend\n```\nThis function takes in a DataFrame `df` and adds a new column `ym` to it, which contains the year and month of each DateTime object as a string in the format \"yyyymm\".\n\nHere is how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nAfter running this code, `df` will have a new column `ym`, where each row contains the year and month of the corresponding DateTime object in the \"yyyymm\" format.","status":200,"tokens":[282,282],"elapsed":6.097774011,"_type":"aimessage"}]
