Here is how to do it:\n\nFirstly, we need to install Dates if it isn't installed yet with `Pkg.add(\"Dates\")`. Then, import it into your code with `using Dates`. \n\nHere's a function that does what you asked for:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = [Dates.year(dt)*100 + Dates.month(dt) for dt in df.dt]\nend\n\n# Example usage:\n\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[Date(2000, 1, 1), Date(2001, 2, 3), Date(2002, 3, 4)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThis function adds a new column to the DataFrame `ym` which is equal to the year (with three digits) followed by the month as integers. The year and month are extracted from the DateTime column `dt`.","status":200,"tokens":[81,257],"elapsed":2.039583802,"_type":"aimessage"}]
