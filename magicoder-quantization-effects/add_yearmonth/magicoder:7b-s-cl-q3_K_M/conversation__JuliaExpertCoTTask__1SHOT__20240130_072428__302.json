Here's how:\n\nFirstly, add `Dates` and `DataFrames` packages in your Julia environment using Pkg.jl. If you haven't added these libraries yet, do it as follows:\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"Dates\")\nPkg.add(\"DataFrames\")\nusing Dates, DataFrames \n```\nThen, define the function `add_yearmonth` which will extract year and month from DateTime object and create a new column in your dataframe:\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = Dates.year.(df.dt).*100 .+ Dates.month.(df.dt)\nend\n```\nNow, you can use the `add_yearmonth` function on your DataFrame:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n\n# Checking the results:\ndisplay(df)\n```\nThis will add a new column `ym` to your DataFrame and fill it with the desired values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,307],"elapsed":2.381834678,"_type":"aimessage"}]
