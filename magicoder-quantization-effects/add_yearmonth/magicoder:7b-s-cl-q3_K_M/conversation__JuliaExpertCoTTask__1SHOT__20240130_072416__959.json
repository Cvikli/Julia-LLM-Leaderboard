Here is how you can create your function:\n\nFirstly, add Dates package using Pkg.add(\"Dates\")\nThen write the following code:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map((dt)->format(dt, \"y\") * string(month(dt)), df.dt)\n    return df\nend\n\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)]);\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nHere's how it works:\n- The `map` function goes through each element of the column `dt`. For each `dt`, it converts it into a string representing year and month.\n- The `format(dt, \"y\")` gives the year part of the date as a string.\n- The `month(dt)` gives the month part of the date as an integer. \n- We convert this month to a string using `string(month(dt))`.\n- Finally, we concatenate these two strings into one.\n- This function adds a new column `ym` with values in the format \"yyyyMM\" where MM is zero padded month and yyyy is the year.","status":200,"tokens":[0,329],"elapsed":2.58716326,"_type":"aimessage"}]
