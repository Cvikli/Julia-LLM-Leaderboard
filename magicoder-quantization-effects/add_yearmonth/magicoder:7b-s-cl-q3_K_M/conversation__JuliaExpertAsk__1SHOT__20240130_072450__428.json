This function will create a new column in your DataFrame that represents the year-month value of each date in your original 'dt' column. \n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = [Dates.year(date)*10000 + Dates.month(date) for date in df.dt]\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `year` and `month` functions from the `Dates` package to extract the year and month parts of each date respectively, and then concatenate them into a single integer. The resulting integer is in the format \"yyyyMM\".\n\nYou can use it with your DataFrame like this: \n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=Date[now()+Month(i) for i in 1:10]) # Create a random Date array of length 10\nadd_yearmonth(df) # Add 'ym' column to df\n```\nYou can then access the new year-month column with `df.ym`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,258],"elapsed":2.00853682,"_type":"aimessage"}]
