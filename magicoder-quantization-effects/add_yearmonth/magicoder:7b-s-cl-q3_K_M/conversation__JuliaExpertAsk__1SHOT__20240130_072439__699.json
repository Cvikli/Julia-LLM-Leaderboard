This assumes your DataFrame is called `df`.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map((x)->Dates.year(x)*100 + Dates.month(x), df.dt)\nend\nadd_yearmonth(df) # Call the function on your DataFrame.\n```\nThis code uses `map` from the `DataFrames` package to apply a function (here, extracting year and month from each DateTime in the column) over every element of the DateTimes column (`dt`), storing the results in a new column (`ym`). Note that we're using `Dates.year` and `Dates.month` from the `Dates` package to get the year and month values respectively from DateTime objects.\n\nAlso, please make sure you have imported all necessary packages in your code for this function to work correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,216],"elapsed":1.68624977,"_type":"aimessage"}]
