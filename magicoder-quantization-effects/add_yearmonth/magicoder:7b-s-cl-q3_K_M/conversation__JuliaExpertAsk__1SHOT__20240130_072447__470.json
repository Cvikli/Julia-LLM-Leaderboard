Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can solve the problem using Julia's DataFrames.jl package:\n\nFirst, make sure to have the necessary packages installed. You can install these packages via the Pkg module. In a new REPL session, run:\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"DataFrames\")\nPkg.add(\"DateTime\")\n```\n\nNow, let's define the function `add_yearmonth`:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nusing DateTime\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)::DataFrame\n    df[:ym] = Dates.format.(df[1], \"yyyymm\")\n    return df\nend\n```\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df` as input, adds a new column `:ym`, and for each row of the DataFrame, it formats the datetime value in `:dt` to the string format `\"yyyymm\"`. The formatted date is then stored into the new `:ym` column. It finally returns the updated DataFrame with the newly added column `:ym`.\n\nNote that you need to make sure your `df[:dt]` values are DateTime objects. If they're strings, you can convert them first like this: \n```julia\ndf[:dt] = [DateTime(d) for d in df[1]]\n```\n\nYou should also use the latest version of Julia and packages as it may have compatibility issues with older versions.","status":200,"tokens":[0,317],"elapsed":2.486970698,"_type":"aimessage"}]
