[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

If it's not imported already, you should do so with `using Dates`. \n\nHere is a solution that uses this module:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = year(df[:dt]) * 100 .+ month(df[:dt])\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes in a DataFrame, and creates the new column `ym` by extracting the year and month from each date in the original `dt` column. It then concatenates them as an integer in format \"yyyymm\" and assigns this to the new `ym` column. Note that you need to use `.+` for addition because adding two vectors is not supported directly on DataFrames.\n\nThis solution assumes that `df[:dt]` are DateTime objects, but if there's a chance they could be something else it might be good to add error checking or conversion code.\n\nPlease replace `:dt` and `:ym` with actual column names used in your dataset. Also replace `df` with the name of your DataFrame variable.","status":200,"tokens":[0,263],"elapsed":2.080539932,"_type":"aimessage"}]
