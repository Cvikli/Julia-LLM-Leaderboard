Here is a simple function to add a new column with year-month as an integer:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map((x)->Dates.year(x)*100 + Dates.month(x), df.dt)\nend\n```\nThe `map` function applies a function across all elements in the column and `Dates.year` and `Dates.month` extract year and month from the DateTime object respectively. The result is then multiplied by 100 to combine them into a single integer.\n\nYou can use this function on your DataFrame:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThis will add a new column `ym` to your DataFrame with the values \"202005\", \"202101\" and \"202212\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,290],"elapsed":2.266148539,"_type":"aimessage"}]
