[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

This function uses the Dates package to extract year and month from DateTime objects.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(x -> Dates.format(x, \"yyyyMM\"), df[:dt])\nend\n```\nIn this function `add_yearmonth`, we iterate over each row in the DataFrame and use the `Dates.format` function to convert the DateTime object into a string with format \"yyyyMM\". This string is then assigned as the value of the new column `:ym`. \n\nThis solution assumes that your DataFrame has a DateTime column named 'dt'. If it doesn't, you need to replace `'dt'` with the correct name.\n\nPlease note that this function will overwrite any existing `ym` column in the DataFrame. If you want to keep the original data and create a new column, you should use a different column name or handle this separately before calling this function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,227],"elapsed":1.961651686,"_type":"aimessage"}]
