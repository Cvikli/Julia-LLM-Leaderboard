The `map` function is used to apply a function to every element in the column `dt`, and `year(x)` and `month(x)` functions from Dates package are used to extract year and month from a date. Then these values are concatenated into single integer with a multiplication operator.","status":200,"tokens":[0,165],"elapsed":1.42723152,"_type":"aimessage"}]
