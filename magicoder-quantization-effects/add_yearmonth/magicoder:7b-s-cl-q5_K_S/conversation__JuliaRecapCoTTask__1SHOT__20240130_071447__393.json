[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

Here is a simple function that does exactly what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = Dates.format.([Date(x) for x in df[:dt]], \"yyyymm\") |> Vector{String} .|> parse\n    return df\nend\n```\nThis function loops over each DateTime in the `dt` column, converts it to a Date object (since DateTime has time information), and then formats it as \"yyyymm\". The `|> Vector{String} .|> parse` is used to convert the resulting array of Strings back into an Array of Integers.\n\nYou can call this function with your DataFrame like so:\n```julia\ndf = add_yearmonth(df)\n```\nPlease note that `Date` and `DateTime` types are from the Dates package in Julia. Also, remember to replace `df` with your actual dataframe variable name.","status":200,"tokens":[0,241],"elapsed":2.104975291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
