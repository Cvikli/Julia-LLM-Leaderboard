The `Dates.format` function is used to extract the year and month from each DateTime value in the `dt` column, and these are then concatenated together into a string.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[Date(2021, 1, 1), Date(2022, 2, 29)], other_column=[\"a\", \"b\"])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThis will add a new column `ym` to the DataFrame with values [\"202101\", \"202202\"].","status":200,"tokens":[0,256],"elapsed":2.145821993,"_type":"aimessage"}]
