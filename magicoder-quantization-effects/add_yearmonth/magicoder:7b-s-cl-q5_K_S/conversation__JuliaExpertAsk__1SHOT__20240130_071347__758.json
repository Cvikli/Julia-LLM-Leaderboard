The function uses the `map` function to apply a function on every row in the DataFrame, which extracts the year and month from the DateTime (`:dt`) column and concatenates them together.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt = [DateTime(2021, 3, 5), DateTime(2019, 7, 15)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nAfter running the code above, `df` will have a new column `:ym` which contains the year month value of `:dt`. For example, in this case, `:ym` would be `[20213, 20197]`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,254],"elapsed":2.211061873,"_type":"aimessage"}]
