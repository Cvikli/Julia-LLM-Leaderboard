If this is not true, then please adjust accordingly based on the actual format of your dates.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the function:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=Date[])\npush!(df.dt,[Date(2000,1,1), Date(2001,5,6)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will create a new column `ym` in the `df` DataFrame with values [\"200001\", \"200105\"].","status":200,"tokens":[112,313],"elapsed":2.717540956,"_type":"aimessage"}]
