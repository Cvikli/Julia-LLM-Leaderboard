It uses the `map` function to apply the `Dates.format` function on each element of the `:dt` column, which formats the DateTime object into a string in \"yyyyMM\" format. \n\nPlease note that if you don't have the DataFrames and Dates packages installed, you can add them using Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\") and Pkg.add(\"Dates\"). \n\nAlso remember to replace `df` with your actual DataFrame name.","status":200,"tokens":[0,184],"elapsed":1.549097327,"_type":"aimessage"}]
