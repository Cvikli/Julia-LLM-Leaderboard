The values of this new column are strings representing the year and month of each date in format \"yyyymm\". It does so by mapping over the DateTimes in the `dt` column and using the `Dates.format` function to convert each DateTime into a string in the desired format. \n\nYou can use it like this:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=DateTime[])\n# Add some dates...\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,215],"elapsed":2.049334099,"_type":"aimessage"}]
