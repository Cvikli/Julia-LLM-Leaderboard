The mapping operation is done using the `map` function from the DataFrames package. For each DateTime value in `dt`, we extract its year and month with `Dates.year(x)` and `Dates.month(x)`, respectively, and then concatenate them into a single integer.\n\nNote: This code assumes that your date column is named \"dt\". If it's different, you should replace \"dt\" with the correct name in the function definition and inside the map operation.","status":200,"tokens":[0,219],"elapsed":2.063316649,"_type":"aimessage"}]
