The values in this new column are calculated by mapping over the dates in the `dt` column of the DataFrame, extracting the year and month from each date, and then concatenating them together into an integer format “yyyymm”.\n\nHere is how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=DateTime[now()-Month(i) for i in 1:3], x=[1,2,3])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will create a new column `ym` with values that are the year and month of each date in the `dt` column, concatenated together as integers.","status":200,"tokens":[0,239],"elapsed":2.259686415,"_type":"aimessage"}]
