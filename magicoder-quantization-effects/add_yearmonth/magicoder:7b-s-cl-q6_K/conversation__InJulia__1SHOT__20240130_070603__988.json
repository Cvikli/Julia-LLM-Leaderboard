First, you need to install it if not installed yet with `Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\")` command. \n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = [format(x, \"yyyyMM\") for x in df[:dt]]\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df` as input and creates a new column `:ym` by extracting year and month from the `:dt` column using the format function which converts DateTime to string with specified format. The `\"yyyyMM\"` specifies that we want the year in 4 digits, followed by month in 2 digits.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that your `df[:dt]` column is of type DateTime. If it isn't you need to convert it first using `convert(DateTime, df[:dt])`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,206],"elapsed":1.93939135,"_type":"aimessage"}]
