Here's how you could write such a function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(x -> Dates.year(x)*100 + Dates.month(x), df[:dt])\nend\n```\n\nIn this function `add_yearmonth`, we're mapping over the `dt` column of the DataFrame, applying the anonymous function to each element in that column. The anonymous function takes a DateTime object and returns an integer representing the year and month combined as \"yyyymm\". \n\nPlease note that the output format assumes that dates are sorted in ascending order. If this is not the case, you might need to sort the DataFrame before applying the `add_yearmonth` function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,199],"elapsed":1.890300517,"_type":"aimessage"}]
