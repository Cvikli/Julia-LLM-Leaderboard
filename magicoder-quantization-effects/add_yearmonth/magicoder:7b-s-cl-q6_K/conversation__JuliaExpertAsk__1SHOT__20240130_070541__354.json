For each DateTime, it extracts the year and month using the `Dates.year` and `Dates.month` functions, respectively, and then combines them together into an integer of the format \"yyyymm\".\n\nPlease remember to import the required packages: `using DataFrames`, `using Dates`. The DataFrame and Date types from these packages will be available for use in your program.","status":200,"tokens":[0,206],"elapsed":1.945238179,"_type":"aimessage"}]
