[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

This function adds a new column to the DataFrame, `df`, named `ym` by extracting year and month from each DateTime in the `dt` column and concatenating them together as an integer:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df) \n    df[:ym] = [Dates.format(d, \"yyyyMM\") for d in df[:dt]]\nend\n```\n\nYou can use the `add_yearmonth` function as follows:\n\n```julia\n# Assume df is a DataFrame with a column :dt of DateTime type\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will create the new column `:ym` in your DataFrame. Note that this solution assumes you are using the `DataFrames` package and it's version of `DataFrame`. If you use a different package or version, you may need to adjust this code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,208],"elapsed":2.007041908,"_type":"aimessage"}]
