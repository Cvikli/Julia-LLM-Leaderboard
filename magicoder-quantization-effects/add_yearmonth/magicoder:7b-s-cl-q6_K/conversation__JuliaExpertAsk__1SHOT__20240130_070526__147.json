Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution for your problem using Julia DataFrames package:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = Dates.format.(df[:dt], \"yyyymm\")\nend\n\n# usage example\ndf = DataFrame(dt = [DateTime(2021, 1, 1), DateTime(2022, 5, 6), DateTime(2023, 9, 7)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\nprintln(df)\n```\nThis function `add_yearmonth` takes a DataFrame as an argument and adds a new column `:ym` to it. This column is populated with string representations of the year and month components of each DateTime in `:dt`. The `Dates.format` function is used for this, which takes a date time and a format string (in this case \"yyyymm\") and returns a string that represents the date time according to that format.\n\nThis solution assumes that your DataFrame `df` contains DateTime objects in column `:dt`. The function will fail if there are any other types of data present. If your datetime is not standardized you might need to convert it first, depending on what exact format it has.","status":200,"tokens":[0,284],"elapsed":2.686499866,"_type":"aimessage"}]
