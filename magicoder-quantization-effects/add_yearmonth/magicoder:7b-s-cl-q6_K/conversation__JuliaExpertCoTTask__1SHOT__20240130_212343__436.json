The `map` function applies this operation to every element in `df.dt`, and the `year` and `month` functions return the year and month components of the DateTime respectively.\n\nYou can use it like so:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will return a new DataFrame with an additional column `ym` containing the desired values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,257],"elapsed":2.451665815,"_type":"aimessage"}]
