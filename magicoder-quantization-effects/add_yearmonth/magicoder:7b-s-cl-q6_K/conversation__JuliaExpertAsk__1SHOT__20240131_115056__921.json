The transformation is performed by `Dates.format(x, \"yyyyMM\")`, which extracts the year and month from a DateTime object `x` and formats them as a string \"yyyymm\".\n\nHere's an example of how you might use this function:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=DateTime[])\npush!(df, [DateTime(\"2021-03-15\")])\npush!(df, [DateTime(\"2022-04-20\")])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nAfter running this code, the `ym` column in your DataFrame would contain strings \"202103\" and \"202204\", respectively.","status":200,"tokens":[0,256],"elapsed":2.443833628,"_type":"aimessage"}]
