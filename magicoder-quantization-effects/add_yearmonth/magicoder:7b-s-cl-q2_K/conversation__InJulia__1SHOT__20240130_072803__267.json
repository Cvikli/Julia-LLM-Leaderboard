Here is how to implement your function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    yearmonth = Dict()\n    for (i, dt) in enumerate(df[:dt])\n        yearmonth[i] = Dates.format(dt, \"yyyymm\")\n    end\n    df[:ym] = Vector{Union{Missing, Int64}}(yearmonth)\nend\n```\nThe `add_yearmonth` function loops through each element in the `df[:dt]` column and calculates the year and month as a string. This is saved into the dictionary `yearmonth`. The new column `ym` is created by associating this dictionary to the DataFrame, with missing values allowed.\n\nPlease make sure you have installed the necessary package (DataFrames) before running the function. If not, install it using the following command in Julia:\n```julia\nPkg.add(\"DataFrames\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[81,236],"elapsed":1.798543403,"_type":"aimessage"}]
