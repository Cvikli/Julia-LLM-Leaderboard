Firstly, we should import the necessary packages like DataFrames and Dates. Then we define the function `add_yearmonth` to add a new column to our dataframe containing the year and month of each date time. Finally we apply this function to our dataframe.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    df[:ym] = map((dt)->format(Date(dt), \"yyyymm\"), df[:dt])\nend\n\n# Create the DataFrame\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)],\n               dt_format=\"yyyymm\")\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nAfter running the above code, `df` would contain a new column named `ym` with values \"2005\", \"2011\" and \"202202\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,243],"elapsed":1.857951946,"_type":"aimessage"}]
