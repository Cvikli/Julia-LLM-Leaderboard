For simplicity, we will assume that `df` is already defined with columns `dt`.\n\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    yearmonth = map(x -> Dates.year(x)*100 + Dates.month(x), df[:dt])  # Extract year and month from DateTime, concatenate them together as an integer in format: \"yyyymm\"\n    df2 = DataFrames.copy(df)   # Create a copy of the original dataframe to avoid modifying it directly\n    DataFrames.append!(df2, DataFrame(ym=yearmonth))  # Append new column 'ym' to our copied dataframe\n    return df2\nend\n```\nThis function `add_yearmonth` takes in a DataFrame `df`, extracts the year and month from each DateTime in the \"dt\" column of that DataFrame, concatenates these as integers (in format: “yyyymm”), creates a new DataFrame with this new column 'ym', appends it to our copied dataframe `df2`, and then returns this new dataframe.","status":200,"tokens":[0,261],"elapsed":1.970338517,"_type":"aimessage"}]
