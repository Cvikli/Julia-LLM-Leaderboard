[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

Please note that the exact syntax or methods would depend on the specific DataFrame package (Pandas, DataFrames.jl etc.) and version you are using. Here I will use `DataFrames` from Julia as an example:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(x -> Dates.year(x)*100 + Dates.month(x), df.dt)\n    return df\nend\n```\nThis function takes a DataFrame and adds a new column `ym` to it, which is the year (yy) and month (mm) concatenated together as an integer. In this example, I'm using `map()` to apply the function on each element of the `dt` column, where the function extracts the year and month from the DateTime object and returns their combination as an integer.\n\nRemember that the specific way you would implement this could depend on whether your DataFrame is of a certain type or version that doesn't support map directly (e.g., pandas in Python), so you might need to write a loop or use `apply()` method for list-like structures instead, depending on how you load and use the specific library.","status":200,"tokens":[0,282],"elapsed":2.215546641,"_type":"aimessage"}]
