Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can solve this problem using Julia's DataFrames library:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    year_month = convert.(Int64, map((dt) -> Dates.year(dt)*100 + Dates.month(dt), df.dt))\n    df[:ym] = year_month\nend\n```\nThis function takes in a DataFrame `df` and adds a new column `ym` to it which contains the integer values of the format \"yyyymm\" for each DateTime value in the 'dt' column. \nThe inner map function extracts the year and month from each DateTime and then multiplies them together (to get yyyy) and adds the months (to get mm). The `convert` function is used to convert these integers back into the Date type because DataFrames does not support storing integers in a Date column.\n\nNote that this solution assumes your DataFrame's 'dt' column is DateTime type, if it's String or some other format you will need additional code to parse the strings as Dates. Also note that `ym` column will contain integer values of \"yyyymm\" and not actual DateTimes.\nIf you want to preserve original DateTime information but just have another column with year+month, then you would be better off using string datatype for 'ym' or consider a different representation scheme like yyyy.mm.","status":200,"tokens":[0,319],"elapsed":2.359700513,"_type":"aimessage"}]
