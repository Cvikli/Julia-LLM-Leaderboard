Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia code to solve this problem:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = [Dates.year(x)*100 + Dates.month(x) for x in df[:dt]]\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Dates` package to extract year and month from each DateTime value in the column `dt`. It then concatenates these two values together into a new integer column `ym`, where the year is multiplied by 100 before addition.\n\nYou can use it like this:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=DateTime[])\npush!(df, (Date(2022, 3, 15),))\npush!(df, (Date(2023, 4, 16),))\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThis will return a DataFrame with an additional column `ym` that contains the year and month from each DateTime as integers. For example, for the first row of `df`, it would add a new entry to the `ym` column with the value 202233 (meaning 2022 March).","status":200,"tokens":[0,281],"elapsed":2.107201654,"_type":"aimessage"}]
