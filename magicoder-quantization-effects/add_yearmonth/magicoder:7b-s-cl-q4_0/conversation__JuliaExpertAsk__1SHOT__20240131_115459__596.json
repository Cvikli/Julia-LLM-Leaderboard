Both these functions return integers. So, when we multiply them by 100 and add, it gives us a new column in our DataFrame with year and month concatenated together as an integer.\n\nThis function modifies the input DataFrame in-place, meaning that no copy of the DataFrame is made. If you want to avoid modifying the original DataFrame, you can use `copy` function:\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df = copy(df) # make a copy so we don't modify the input DataFrame\n    df[:ym] = map(d -> year(d)*100 + month(d), df.dt) |> Vector{Int}\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,305],"elapsed":2.297647406,"_type":"aimessage"}]
