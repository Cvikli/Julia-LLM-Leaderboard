The values of this new column are the year and month from each DateTime in `dt`, formatted as an integer in “yyyymm” format. \n\nThe `Dates.format(x, \"yyyyMM\")` function is used to extract the year and month from each DateTime value in the `dt` column and format them into a string with the format “yyyymm”. This new formatted string is then converted back to an integer using the `Int64` type conversion function. \n\nThis code assumes that your date/time strings are stored as DateTimes within your DataFrame, and it adds a new column to the DataFrame with these values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,216],"elapsed":1.647455103,"_type":"aimessage"}]
