Inside this function, we add a new column `:ym` to our DataFrame with the results of applying the function `Dates.format` to each DateTime in the `:dt` column of our DataFrame. The format `\"yyyyMM\"` represents the year and month as integers concatenated together in the form \"yyyymm\". We then call this function on a sample DataFrame and display the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,236],"elapsed":1.800185087,"_type":"aimessage"}]
