The mapper function extracts the year and month from each DateTime object, multiplies the year by 100, and then adds the month. This results in an integer of format “yyyymm”.\n\nAn example usage would be:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020,1,1), DateTime(2021,2,29), DateTime(2023,3,15)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will add a new column `ym` to the DataFrame that consists of integers “202001”, “202102”, and “202303” respectively.","status":200,"tokens":[0,269],"elapsed":2.019852143,"_type":"aimessage"}]
