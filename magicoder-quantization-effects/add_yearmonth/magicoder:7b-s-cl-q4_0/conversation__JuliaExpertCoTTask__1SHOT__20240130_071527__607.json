These two values are then combined into a single integer as per the problem statement where the year is multiplied by 100 before addition to avoid overflow issues when concatenating them. The result is stored in new column `ym`.\n\nAfter running this function, you should see a new column `ym` in your DataFrame. This column contains the integer value of year and month from each DateTime entry.","status":200,"tokens":[0,283],"elapsed":2.124685576,"_type":"aimessage"}]
