The values in this column are strings, each representing the year (e.g., \"2019\"), followed by the month (as two digits, e.g., \"07\") of the original DateTime value from `:dt`.\n\nThe `map` function is used to apply a transformation to every element of an array (in this case, each row of the DataFrame). The transformation in this case is extracting and formatting the year and month from each date string. \n\nThen it uses `string.(df[:dt])`, where `:dt` is a column of DateTime values, to convert these DateTime objects into strings so that they can be manipulated as required by the DateFormat function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,245],"elapsed":1.841341547,"_type":"aimessage"}]
