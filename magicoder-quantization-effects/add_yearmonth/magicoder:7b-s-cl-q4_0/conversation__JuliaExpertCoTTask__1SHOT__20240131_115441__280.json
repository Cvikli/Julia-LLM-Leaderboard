The transformation is defined as a closure that extracts the year and month from each DateTime object using the `Dates.format` function with appropriate format codes, concatenates them together into a string, and pads the month part (if necessary) with zeros so it's always two digits.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,240],"elapsed":1.822065734,"_type":"aimessage"}]
