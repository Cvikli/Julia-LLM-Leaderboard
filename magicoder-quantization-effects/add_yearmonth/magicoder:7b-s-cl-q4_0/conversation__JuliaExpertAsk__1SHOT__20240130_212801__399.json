The `map` function applies a function (extracting year and month) to every element in the `dt` column, and then the result is converted into an integer by multiplying the year with 100 and adding the month.\n\nHere's how you can use it:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=DateTime[2022/03/15, 2021/06/27, 2024/09/18])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will add a new column `ym` to the DataFrame with values [202203, 202106, 202409].","status":200,"tokens":[0,274],"elapsed":2.026194794,"_type":"aimessage"}]
