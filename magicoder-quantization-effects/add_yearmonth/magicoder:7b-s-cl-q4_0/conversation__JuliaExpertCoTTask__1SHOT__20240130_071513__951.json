These are then concatenated together in a string format. The `|> x -> parse(Int, string(x))` part of the pipeline converts this combined string back into an integer for each row in the column `:ym`.\n\nHere is how you can use the function with the provided data:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will output:\n```julia\n6021    20205\n6022    20211\n6023    202212\n```","status":200,"tokens":[282,348],"elapsed":6.730545313,"_type":"aimessage"}]
