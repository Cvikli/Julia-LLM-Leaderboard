[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

This function assumes that the input DataFrame (`df`) already has a column `dt` of type DateTime. \n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    df[:ym] = map(d -> format(Date(d), \"yyyyMM\"), df[:dt])\nend\n```\n\nIn the function above, we're using the `map` function from DataFrames.jl package to apply a transformation to every row in the column `dt`. The transformation is defined as a closure (function inside a function) that uses the `format` function from Dates.jl package to format each DateTime value into \"yyyyMM\" string format, which represents the year and month of the date separately.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes you have the DataFrames.jl package installed in your Julia environment, because map is a function provided by this package. You can install it with `Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\")`.\n  \nIf you have any special instructions to follow, feel free to provide them. Otherwise, I hope this general guideline helps!","status":200,"tokens":[0,254],"elapsed":1.975239851,"_type":"aimessage"}]
