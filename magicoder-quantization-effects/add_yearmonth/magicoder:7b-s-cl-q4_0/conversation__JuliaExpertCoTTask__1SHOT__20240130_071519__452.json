Here's how you could define the function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map((d)->string(d.year)*lpad(string(d.month),2,\"0\"), df.dt)\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by mapping over the `dt` column and for each DateTime, it extracts the year and month and concatenates them into a new string. The `lpad` function from DataFrames.jl is used to make sure that the month part has always two digits (adding a leading zero if necessary).\n\nYou can then apply this function to your dataframe as follows:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will output:\n\n| dt               | ym    |\n|-----------------|-------|\n| 2020-05-24T00:00:00 | 202005 |\n| 2021-01-15T00:00:00 | 202101 |\n| 2022-12-05T00:00:00 | 202212 |","status":200,"tokens":[0,376],"elapsed":2.802980205,"_type":"aimessage"}]
