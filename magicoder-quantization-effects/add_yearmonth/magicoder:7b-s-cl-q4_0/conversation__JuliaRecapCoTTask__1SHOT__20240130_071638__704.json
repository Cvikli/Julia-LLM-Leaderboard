[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

Firstly, you need to install it if it's not already available by running `]add DataFrames`.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map((x) -> Dates.year(x)*100 + Dates.month(x), df.dt)\nend\n```\n\nHere's how you can use the function with a sample DataFrame:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 1, 1):Month:DateTime(2020, 3, 31)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nAfter running this code snippet, you should see a new column `ym` in your DataFrame that represents the year and month of each date. For example, for the first row (DateTime(2020, 1, 1)), it will be 202001.","status":200,"tokens":[0,239],"elapsed":1.850408269,"_type":"aimessage"}]
