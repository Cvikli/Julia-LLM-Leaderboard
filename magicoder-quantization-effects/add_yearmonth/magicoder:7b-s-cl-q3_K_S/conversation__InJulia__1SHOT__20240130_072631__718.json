The `Dates.format` function is used on this set of DateTimes to format them as strings in the desired \"yyyyMM\" format, which we then concatenate together into a single integer using the `+` operator. \n\nPlease note that you need to have 'DataFrames' package installed in your environment to run the DataFrame related operations. You can install it via `Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\")` command.","status":200,"tokens":[0,227],"elapsed":1.785596937,"_type":"aimessage"}]
