Here's how you can solve it:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(x -> DateFormat(\"yyyyMM\")(x).value, df.dt)\n    return df\nend\n\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis code first imports the necessary libraries. The function `add_yearmonth` takes a DataFrame as input and adds a new column `ym` to it. It does this by mapping over the DateTime values in the `dt` column of the DataFrame, converting each one to an integer in the \"yyyymm\" format using `DateFormat(\"yyyyMM\")(x).value`. The result is then assigned back to the original `df` DataFrame. After defining and calling `add_yearmonth`, we can print the resulting DataFrame to see our new column.","status":200,"tokens":[0,254],"elapsed":2.021286243,"_type":"aimessage"}]
