[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

In this example, we will use the DataFrames and Dates libraries to manipulate dates and create a new column with yearmonth: \n\nFirst, let’s assume that you have a dataframe `df` and it has a DateTime column named `dt`. Then, you can define your function as follows:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map((x)->Dates.year(x)*100+Dates.month(x), df.dt)\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `map` function to apply a function `(x)->Dates.year(x)*100+Dates.month(x)` to every element in `df.dt`. This function extracts the year and month from the DateTime object, concatenate them together as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\", and assigns it to a new column `ym` in the dataframe `df`.\n\nIf you want to use special instructions for this task, please provide the detail.","status":200,"tokens":[0,250],"elapsed":2.017391253,"_type":"aimessage"}]
