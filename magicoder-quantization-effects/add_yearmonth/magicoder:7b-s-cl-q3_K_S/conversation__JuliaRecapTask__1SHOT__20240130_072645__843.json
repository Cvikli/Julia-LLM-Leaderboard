[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

In this case, we apply the `Dates.formatmmdd` method on every date in our data frame, which gives us the Date object formatted as a string in the \"yyyymm\" format.\n- We then add a new column `ym` to our DataFrame with these formatted dates using the `df[:ym] = ...` assignment.\n- Finally, we test this function on an example data frame and print the resulting DataFrame. \n\nPlease replace `Date(2021, 5, 3), Date(2022, 6, 4), Date(2023,7,5)` with your actual dates in `df` to get the desired result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,444],"elapsed":3.606367292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
