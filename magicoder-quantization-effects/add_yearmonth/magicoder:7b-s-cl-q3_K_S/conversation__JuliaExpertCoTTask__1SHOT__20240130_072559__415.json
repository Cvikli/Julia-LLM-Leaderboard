The values of the new column are extracted from the DateTimes using the Dates.format method combined with the \"yyyymm\" format string. These date-time strings are then converted into integers using the parse method, and finally returned as an array of integers.\n\nYou can call this function on your DataFrame like so: \n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will create a new column `ym` with the values `\"202005\"`, `\"202101\"`, and `\"202212\"` respectively.","status":200,"tokens":[0,299],"elapsed":2.383041175,"_type":"aimessage"}]
