Inside the function, we define another function `dt2ym` to extract and concatenate year and month from each DateTime in the DataFrame's `dt` column. The extracted integer is created using the `format` method of a DateTime object.\n\nFinally, we use the `map` function to apply this function to every element in `df.dt` (the DateTime column) and create a new column `ym`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,191],"elapsed":1.502134716,"_type":"aimessage"}]
