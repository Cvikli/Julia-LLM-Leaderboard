For each element in the original column `dt`, it extracts the year and month using the `Dates.year` and `Dates.month` functions from the Dates package, converts them to integers, and concatenates them together into one single integer in format “yyyymm”. The new column is then added to the DataFrame.\nPlease note that the resultant column would be a year * 100 + month value.","status":200,"tokens":[0,223],"elapsed":1.751985088,"_type":"aimessage"}]
