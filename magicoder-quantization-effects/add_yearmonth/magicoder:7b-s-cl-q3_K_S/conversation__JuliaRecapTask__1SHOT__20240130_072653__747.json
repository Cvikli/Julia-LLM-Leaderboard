[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

Here's a simple function that accomplishes your task:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = Dates.format.(df[Symbol(\"dt\")], \"yyyymm\").-string(0x30) # subtract 48 to get numeric format for each date\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by creating a new column `ym` in the DataFrame, which is populated with the string representation of the year and month from each DateTime value. The `Dates.format` function is used to extract the year (yy) and month (mm) components of the date. Then, the `String(0x30)` operation is used to convert these strings into integers. Note that this assumes your dates are consistently in the correct format. \n\nTo use this function, simply call it with the DataFrame as follows:\n```julia\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,242],"elapsed":1.95355329,"_type":"aimessage"}]
