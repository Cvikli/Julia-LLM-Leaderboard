[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

And then, you can use the string interpolation feature `$` in Julia for concatenating these values as a string. Here's how:\n\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    df[!, :ym] = [string((d=DateTime(df[i, :dt])).year*100 + (d+Month(1))-month(d)) for i in eachrow(df)]\nend\n```\n\nThis function loops over each row of the DataFrame and extracts year and month from `dt` column. It then concatenates these values to form a new column `ym`. \n\nPlease note that you need to make sure your DataFrames package is up-to-date because this function uses the features available in the current version (1.5) of the DataFrames package. The function modifies the DataFrame in-place by using the broadcasting syntax.","status":200,"tokens":[0,229],"elapsed":1.844765791,"_type":"aimessage"}]
