Here's how you would define such function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = Dates.format.(df[Symbol(\"dt\")], \"%Y%m\") .|> x -> parse(Int64,x)  # Convert date to string in \"yyyymm\" format and then convert back to integer\n    return df\nend\n```\nThis function takes a dataframe `df` as an argument. It creates a new column `ym` by extracting the year and month from each DateTime in `dt`. The result is an integer in the \"yyyyMM\" format. Finally, it returns the updated dataframe. \n\nNote that the DataFrames package has a function `format()` which can be used to convert DateTimes to string representation.\n\nHere's how you would use this function:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[Date(2021,1,1), Date(2022,2,3), Date(2023,4,5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThe output would be a dataframe with the additional `ym` column containing the year and month of each datetime as an integer in \"yyyyMM\" format.","status":200,"tokens":[0,301],"elapsed":2.376552169,"_type":"aimessage"}]
