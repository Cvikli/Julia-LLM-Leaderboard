Here is an example:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = [string(x.year)*string(month(x)) for x in df[:dt]]\nend\n```\nIn this function, we iterate over the `DateTime` values in the `dt` column of the DataFrame. For each `DateTime`, we extract the year and month using the `year` and `month` functions from the Dates module and convert them to a string. We then concatenate these two strings into the form \"yyyymm\". Finally, we add this new column (`ym`) to our DataFrame.\n\nYou can call this function like so:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will add a new column (`ym`) to the DataFrame with values in the form \"yyyymm\" representing the year and month of each `DateTime`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,286],"elapsed":2.273584595,"_type":"aimessage"}]
