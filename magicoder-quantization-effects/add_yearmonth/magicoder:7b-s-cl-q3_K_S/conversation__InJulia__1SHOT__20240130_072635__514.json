Here's how you would write the function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    df[:ym] = [Dates.year(dt)*100 + Dates.month(dt) for dt in df[:dt]]\nend\n```\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df` as input, and adds a new column `ym` to the DataFrame that consists of year-month values from the original date column `dt`. It does this by iterating through each element in the :dt column of the DataFrame, extracting the year and month using the `Dates.year` and `Dates.month` functions, concatenating them into a single integer, and then storing it in the new :ym column for that particular row.","status":200,"tokens":[0,191],"elapsed":1.492482486,"_type":"aimessage"}]
