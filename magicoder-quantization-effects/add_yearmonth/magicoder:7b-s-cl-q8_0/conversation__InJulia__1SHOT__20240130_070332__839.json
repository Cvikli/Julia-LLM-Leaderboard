The function `Year(dt)` gives you just the year part of `dt`, and similarly for months `Month(dt)`. Then, you concatenate these into a string and parse it as an integer. Here's how to do it:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = [string(Year(t), Month(t)) for t in df[:dt]]\nend\n```\nThis function adds a new column `ym` to the DataFrame, where each entry is the year and month from corresponding DateTime entry in `dt`. Note that you need to ensure `df` contains a DateTime column called `:dt`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,168],"elapsed":1.812270446,"_type":"aimessage"}]
