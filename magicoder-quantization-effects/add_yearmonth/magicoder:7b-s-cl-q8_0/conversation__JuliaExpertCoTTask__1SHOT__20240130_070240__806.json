Then it defines a function add_yearmonth which takes as input a dataframe `df` with at least one column named \"dt\". Inside this function, for each date-time in the 'dt' column, we use the `Dates.year` and `Dates.month` functions to extract the year and month respectively. We then concatenate these two numbers into an integer using arithmetic operations, and store it as a new column 'ym'. Finally, we test this function with your data.","status":200,"tokens":[0,262],"elapsed":2.875352466,"_type":"aimessage"}]
