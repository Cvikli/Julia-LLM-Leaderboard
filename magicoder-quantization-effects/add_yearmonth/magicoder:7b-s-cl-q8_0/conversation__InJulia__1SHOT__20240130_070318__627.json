Here's how you might go about creating a function to achieve that:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = [Date(dt).year * 100 + Date(dt).month for dt in df.dt]\n    return df\nend\n```\nIn this function, we take a DataFrame as input and then loop over the column `dt` of that DataFrame to extract the year and month components of each DateTime using the built-in Date() function from Dates package. We then concatenate these components together by multiplying the year component by 100 (to shift it into two digit form) and adding the month component. The resulting column is added as a new column named `ym` in our DataFrame, which is then returned by the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,206],"elapsed":2.254746553,"_type":"aimessage"}]
