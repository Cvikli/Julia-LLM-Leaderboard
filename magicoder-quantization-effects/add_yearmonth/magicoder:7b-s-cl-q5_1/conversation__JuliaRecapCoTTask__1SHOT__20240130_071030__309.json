[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

For simplicity's sake, we are assuming that `DateTime` column has all its entries as valid dates. \n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = [Dates.format(d, \"yyyymm\") for d in df[:dt]]\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by defining a new column `ym` in the DataFrame that is populated with formatted strings of year and month extracted from each entry in `dt`. \n\nRemember to include necessary imports at the top of your file. If you are working in Jupyter Notebook, make sure to add these libraries via cell's magic commands (`%using`) before running the function. \n\nIn case if you have some special instructions that require more specific solution or different approach, kindly specify those and I would be happy to provide a more tailored solution.","status":200,"tokens":[11,213],"elapsed":1.9734788,"_type":"aimessage"}]
