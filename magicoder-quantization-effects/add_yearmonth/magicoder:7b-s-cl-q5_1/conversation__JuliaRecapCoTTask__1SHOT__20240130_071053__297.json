[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

The transformation is a function that extracts year and month from date time, then concatenate them together as an integer in \"yyyymm\" format.\n\nThe instructions will be useful when you want to add some additional functionality or modifications to the solution. For example, if you wanted to only consider the years between 2000-2019 and ignore values outside this range, you could modify the `map` function as follows:\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(x -> Dates.year(x)*100 + Dates.month(x), df[:dt]) .+ 200000 .* (df[:dt] .>= Date(\"2000-1-1\")) .* (df[:dt] .<= Date(\"2019-12-31\"))\nend\n```\nThis way, only dates between the years 2000 and 2019 will be included in `ym`, all others will be ignored.","status":200,"tokens":[0,369],"elapsed":3.356275098,"_type":"aimessage"}]
