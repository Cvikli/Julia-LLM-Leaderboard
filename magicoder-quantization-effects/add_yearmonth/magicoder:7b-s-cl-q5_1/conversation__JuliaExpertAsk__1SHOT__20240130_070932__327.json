Inside this function, it adds a new column 'ym' to the DataFrame by converting DateTimes in 'dt' into string format with \"%Y%m\" as the pattern (i.e., \"yyyy-mm\") and assigns this value to 'ym'. After defining the function, an example DataFrame `df` is created and passed to the function, then it prints out the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,232],"elapsed":2.075044279,"_type":"aimessage"}]
