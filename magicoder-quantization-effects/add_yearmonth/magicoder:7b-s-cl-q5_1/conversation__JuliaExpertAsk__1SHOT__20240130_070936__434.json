Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution written in Julia language:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(x -> Dates.format(x, \"yyyyMM\"), df[:dt])\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nIn this solution: \n- We use the `using` statement to import the necessary packages (DataFrames and Dates).\n- We define a function `add_yearmonth` that takes a DataFrame as input. Inside this function, we create a new column `:ym` in the DataFrame which stores year and month from `:dt`.\n- The mapping operation is done using the `map` function where we use the Dates.format method to convert each date in `:dt` to \"yyyyMM\" format. This will return a vector of strings with the formatted dates.\n- Finally, we return the updated DataFrame. \n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt = [Date(2021,4,5), Date(2022,3,6)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will add a new column `:ym` to `df`, where the first row is \"202104\" and the second row is \"202203\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,301],"elapsed":2.695511933,"_type":"aimessage"}]
