The `map` function applies an operation to each element of the specified column (here: `:dt`). In this case, it uses the `DateFormatter` from the Dates module to extract and format the year and month from each DateTime object. The result is then stored in a new column (`:ym`) in the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,161],"elapsed":1.438567261,"_type":"aimessage"}]
