The anonymous function takes a Date object and returns its year (formatted as Y) followed by month (formatted as m).\n\nFor example, if date in df.dt is \"2021-05-30T00:00:00\", then after applying this function, the new column `df[:ym]` will contain \"202105\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,171],"elapsed":1.525148932,"_type":"aimessage"}]
