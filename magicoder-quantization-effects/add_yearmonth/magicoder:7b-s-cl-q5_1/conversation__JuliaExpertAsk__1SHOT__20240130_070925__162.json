Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can achieve this using the `DateTimeFormat` module in Julia, specifically the `D` for day and `M` for month. Here's a function that does exactly what you asked:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = convert(Array{Int64, 1}, map(x -> DateTimeFormat.D.format(DateTimeFormat.M.format(x)) * DateTimeFormat.D.format(x), df.dt))\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a DataFrame as input and adds a new column to it. It uses the `map` function which applies a given function to each element of an array, producing a new array with the results. The function applied is very specific: it takes a DateTime object (`x`) and produces a string that includes only year and month in \"yyyyMM\" format.\n\nPlease note that you should include `using DateTimeFormat` at the beginning of your code if it's not already included. Also, this solution assumes that all entries in df.dt are valid DateTimes. If there could be some invalid dates (for example, February 30), you may want to add additional error checking and handling logic to handle these cases appropriately.","status":200,"tokens":[0,275],"elapsed":2.459809273,"_type":"aimessage"}]
