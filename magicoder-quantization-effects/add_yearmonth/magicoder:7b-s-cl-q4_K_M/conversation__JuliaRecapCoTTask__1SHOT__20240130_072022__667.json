[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes. Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The task can be solved using the built-in functions to convert DateTimes into strings, which we will then manipulate to get our desired result. Here is a Julia function that does this:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(x->Dates.format(x,\"y\"), df[:dt]) * map(x->Dates.format(x,\"m\"), df[:dt])\nend\n```\nThis function works by mapping over the `dt` column, applying two Date formatting functions to each value: one that formats as a 4-digit year (`\"y\"`), and another for a 2-digit month (`\"m\"`). By multiplying these two strings together (which will be concatenated into an integer string), we get our desired result.\n\nFor example, if `dt` contains values like \"2021-07-01T00:00:00\", after applying this function we would have a new column `ym` that looks like \"20217\" for the same row.","status":200,"tokens":[0,247],"elapsed":2.044947703,"_type":"aimessage"}]
