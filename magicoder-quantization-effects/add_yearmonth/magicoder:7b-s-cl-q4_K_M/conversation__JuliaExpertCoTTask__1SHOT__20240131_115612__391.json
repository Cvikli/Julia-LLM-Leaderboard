Inside the function, we create a new column `ym` using the `map` function, which applies a function to each element in an array (in our case, each row of the DataFrame). We use the `year` and `month` functions from the Dates package to extract the year and month from each DateTime. The result is then converted into integer format by multiplying the year with 100 and adding the month.\n\nThe test data frame `df` is created, and the function is called with this DataFrame as an argument. After calling the function, you can check if the new column `ym` has been added to the DataFrame correctly by printing it out:\n```julia\nprintln(df)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,316],"elapsed":2.542720154,"_type":"aimessage"}]
