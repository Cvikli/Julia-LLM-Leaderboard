The resulting strings are then concatenated together to form a single integer, which is stored in the new column `:ym`.\n\nWhen you run this code with your example DataFrame, it will add a new column `ym` to the DataFrame where each value is an integer formatted as \"yyyymm\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,256],"elapsed":2.053113242,"_type":"aimessage"}]
