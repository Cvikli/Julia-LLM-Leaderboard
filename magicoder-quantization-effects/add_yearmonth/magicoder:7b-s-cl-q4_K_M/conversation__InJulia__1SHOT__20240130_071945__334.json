It maps over the DateTime values in `df.dt`, extracting both the year and month components and formatting them into the string \"yyyymm\". The `lpad` function is used to ensure that the month is always 2 digits long, with leading zeros if necessary.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt = [Date(\"2021-01-01\"), Date(\"2022-10-31\")])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis would result in a new column `ym` that contains the year and month of each date, formatted as an integer \"yyyymm\". For example, the first row of `df` would have 202101 (the year 2021 and month 01), while the second row would have 202210 (the year 2022 and month 10).","status":200,"tokens":[0,327],"elapsed":2.596027371,"_type":"aimessage"}]
