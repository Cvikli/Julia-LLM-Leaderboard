The `Dates.format()` function is used to format the date time values into the desired \"yyyyMM\" format, where \"yyyy\" stands for the 4-digit year and \"MM\" stands for the 2-digit month.\n\nPlease note that you should have DataFrames package installed in your Julia environment to run this code successfully.
