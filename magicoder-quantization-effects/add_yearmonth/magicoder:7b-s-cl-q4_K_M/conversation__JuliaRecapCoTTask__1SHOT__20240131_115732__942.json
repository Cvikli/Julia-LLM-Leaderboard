[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

The values in this new column are the year (extracted from `:dt`) multiplied by 100 and added to the month (also extracted from `:dt`). This gives us a string in the format \"yyyymm\".\n\nIf you want to add the new column in-place, without creating a copy of the DataFrame, use `df[:ym] = ...` instead. Here is how it would look:\n\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth!(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = year(df[:dt]) * 100 .+ month(df[:dt])\nend\n```\n\nThis version of the function modifies the DataFrame in-place, which can be more efficient if you're working with a large DataFrame and don't need to keep the original data around.","status":200,"tokens":[0,272],"elapsed":2.213635202,"_type":"aimessage"}]
