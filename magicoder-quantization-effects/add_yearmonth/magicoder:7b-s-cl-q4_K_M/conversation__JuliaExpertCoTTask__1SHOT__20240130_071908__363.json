Here's how you might define a function `add_yearmonth` that does it:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates, DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = [Dates.format(d, \"yyyymm\") for d in df.dt]\nend\n```\n\nThe `add_yearmonth` function takes a DataFrame `df` as input and uses the `Dates.format` function from the Dates package to convert each DateTime value in the `dt` column of the DataFrame to the format \"yyyymm\". The resulting strings are then stored in a new column called `ym`.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will modify the `df` DataFrame in place to include a new column `ym`.
