This is then converted back into an integer with type casting (`Int64`). The result is stored in the new `ym` column.\n\nTo use this function, you can create a DataFrame and call the function like so:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=DateTime[])  # Create an empty DataFrame\n# Add some dates to df...\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nPlease note that this function mutates the original dataframe, if you don't want it to do that you can change `df[:ym]` to `copy(df.dt)` or something similar depending on your use case.","status":200,"tokens":[0,252],"elapsed":2.003618955,"_type":"aimessage"}]
