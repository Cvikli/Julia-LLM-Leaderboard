The result is stored in the new column `ym`. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that your DataFrame has a DateTime column named `:dt`. If it doesn't or if you have a different column name, you will need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,194],"elapsed":1.517606448,"_type":"aimessage"}]
