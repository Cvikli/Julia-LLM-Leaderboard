These values can then be converted into strings using `string` function and concatenated together with a space in between. Finally, you can add this new column to your DataFrame.\n\nHere is how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map((dt)->string(Year(dt)) * string(Month(dt)), df.dt)\n    return df\nend\n\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThis code will add a new column `ym` to the DataFrame `df`. Each value in this new column is the concatenation of the year and month components of each datetime object from the original `dt` column. For example, for the first row in `df`, it would be \"20205\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,269],"elapsed":2.160597762,"_type":"aimessage"}]
