The result is then assigned back into the DataFrame under the new column name `ym`.\n\nTo use this function, you simply need to pass your DataFrame:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=DateTime[]) # create an empty dataframe\n# add some dates here...\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will add a new column `ym` with the desired format.","status":200,"tokens":[0,197],"elapsed":1.568061244,"_type":"aimessage"}]
