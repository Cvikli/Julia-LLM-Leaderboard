It uses the built-in `Dates.format` function to extract year and month from each DateTime in `dt`, concatenating them together as an integer in format \"yyyyMM\". \n\nNote that this solution assumes that your DateTime column is named \"dt\" and is of type DateTime. If these assumptions do not hold, you would need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,177],"elapsed":1.389579819,"_type":"aimessage"}]
