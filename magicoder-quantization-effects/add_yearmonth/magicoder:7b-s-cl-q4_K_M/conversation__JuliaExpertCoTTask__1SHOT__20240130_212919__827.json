The values in this new column are the year and month of each DateTime value from the original `dt` column, concatenated together into an integer string format \"yyyymm\". \n\nThe `map` function applies the anonymous function `(x -> Dates.format(x, \"yyyyMM\"))` to every element in the `dt` column, which converts each DateTime object to a string in the desired format. The `|> Vector{String}` part is needed because `Dates.format` returns a String and `map` by default would return an Array of Any. By explicitly converting the result to a Vector of Strings, we ensure that all elements are Strings as expected.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nAfter running this code, `df` will have a new column `ym` with the values \"202005\", \"202101\", and \"202212\".","status":200,"tokens":[282,357],"elapsed":13.69232446,"_type":"aimessage"}]
