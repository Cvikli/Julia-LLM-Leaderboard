[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

Here is how you could do it:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = Dates.format.(df[:dt], \"yyyyMM\")\n    return df\nend\n```\nThis function takes in a DataFrame `df` and adds a new column `ym`. It uses the `Dates.format` function to format each DateTime in `dt` as a string, then concatenates this into \"yyyymm\" format. \n\nPlease note that you need to have `DataFrames.jl` installed in your environment.
