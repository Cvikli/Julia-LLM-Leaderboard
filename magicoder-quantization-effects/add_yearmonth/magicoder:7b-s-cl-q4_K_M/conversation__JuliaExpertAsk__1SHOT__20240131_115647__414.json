The `map` function applies a function to each element of a column, here it's extracting the year and month from the DateTimes.\n\nYou can test this function with some data like so:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt = [DateTime(2021, 1, 1), DateTime(2022, 2, 29)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will give you a new column `:ym` in your dataframe that contains the year and month of each date time as an integer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,250],"elapsed":1.987374298,"_type":"aimessage"}]
