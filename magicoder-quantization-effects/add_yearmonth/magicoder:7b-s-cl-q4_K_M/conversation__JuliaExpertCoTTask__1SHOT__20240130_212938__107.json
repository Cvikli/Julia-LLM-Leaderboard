The values in this new column are calculated by mapping over the original `:dt` column and applying the function `x -> year(x)*100 + month(x)` which extracts the year and month from each DateTime value and combines them into an integer.\n\nWhen you run this code with your provided data, it will add a new column to the DataFrame `df`, where every row is the year and month of the corresponding `:dt` value combined into one number in the format “yyyymm”.","status":200,"tokens":[0,271],"elapsed":2.152669498,"_type":"aimessage"}]
