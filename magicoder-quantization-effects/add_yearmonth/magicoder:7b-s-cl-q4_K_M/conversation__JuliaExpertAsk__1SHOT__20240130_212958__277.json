The map function applies the anonymous function (the second argument) to all elements of the column `:dt`, which extracts the year and month from each DateTime object. These are then combined into an integer in \"yyyymm\" format.\n\nHere is how you can use it:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\ndf = DataFrame(dt = [Date(2021, 1, 1), Date(2022, 2, 28)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nAfter running this code, `df` will look like:\n\n| dt         | ym    |\n|------------|-------|\n| 2021-01-01 | 202101 |\n| 2022-02-28 | 202202 |","status":200,"tokens":[0,309],"elapsed":2.430584276,"_type":"aimessage"}]
