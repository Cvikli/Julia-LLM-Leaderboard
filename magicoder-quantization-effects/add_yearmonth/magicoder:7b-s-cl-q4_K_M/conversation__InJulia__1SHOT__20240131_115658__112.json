The value in each row of the new column is calculated by mapping over the values in the `:dt` column, where for each DateTime object `x`, the year is extracted using `year(x)` and the month is extracted using `month(x)`. These two numbers are then concatenated together with a multiplication operator (*) to form an integer in format “yyyymm”.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=DateTime[Dates.now() - Month(i) for i in 1:5])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\ndisplay(df)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,233],"elapsed":1.847178974,"_type":"aimessage"}]
