[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

The function `add_yearmonth` uses the `Dates` module from Julia's standard library to extract year and month from a DateTime object, then concatenate them together as an integer in format \"yyyymm\".\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(x -> format(x, \"yyyyMM\"), df.dt)\nend\n```\nThis function modifies the input `DataFrame` in-place and adds a new column `:ym`. The `map` function applies the anonymous function `(x -> format(x, \"yyyyMM\"))` to each element of the `df.dt` column, which is equivalent to extracting year and month from DateTime object and formatting them as \"yyyymm\".\n\nPlease note that you need to have DataFrames package installed in your Julia environment. If it's not installed yet, you can add it using Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\").","status":200,"tokens":[0,226],"elapsed":1.820502025,"_type":"aimessage"}]
