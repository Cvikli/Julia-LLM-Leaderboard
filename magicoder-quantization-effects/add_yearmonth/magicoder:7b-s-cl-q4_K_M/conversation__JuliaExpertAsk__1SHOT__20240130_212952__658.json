The values in this new column are calculated by mapping over the original column `:dt`, using the function `year(x)*100 + month(x)`. This function extracts the year and month from each DateTime value `x` and returns them concatenated together as an integer.\n\nYou can use it like so:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=DateTime[]) # create a new empty DataFrame\n# add some data to df.dt, for example:\npush!(df.dt, DateTime(\"2021-05-06T14:32:12\"))\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nAfter running the last line of code, `df` will have a new column `:ym`, where each value is an integer representing the year and month in the format \"yyyymm\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,276],"elapsed":2.174074546,"_type":"aimessage"}]
