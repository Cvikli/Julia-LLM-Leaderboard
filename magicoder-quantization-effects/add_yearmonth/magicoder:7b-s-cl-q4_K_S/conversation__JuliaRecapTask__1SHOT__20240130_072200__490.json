[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

It uses the `map` function to apply a function (which extracts the year and month from each DateTime in `df[:dt]`) to every element of this column, which is then stored in `df[:ym]`. The resulting DataFrame with a new column `ym` is then returned.\n\nThis solution assumes that the DataFrame has a column named \"dt\" containing DateTimes, and it will modify the DataFrame in-place. If you want to preserve the original DataFrame, you could clone it first:\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    dfnew = copy(df)  # clone df\n    dfnew[:ym] = map(d -> year(d)*100 + month(d), dfnew.dt)\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,263],"elapsed":2.073849206,"_type":"aimessage"}]
