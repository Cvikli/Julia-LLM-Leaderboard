[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

Here is how you would write this function using Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame) \n    df[:ym] = map(d -> format(d, \"yyyymm\"), df[:dt])\n    return df\nend\n```\nThe `map` function applies a function (the first argument) to each value in an array (the second argument). Here we use the DateFormat type to specify that we want to format the DateTime as a string where years have three digits and months have two. The resulting strings are then concatenated together into one long string, which is added to a new column `ym` in the DataFrame.\n\nYou can call this function like so:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt = [DateTime(2021, 5, 1), DateTime(2022, 6, 30)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n#    dt        ym\n# 1  2021-05-01 202105\n# 2  2022-06-30 202206\n```","status":200,"tokens":[11,288],"elapsed":2.291468325,"_type":"aimessage"}]
