[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

Note that Date type is used in DataFrames.jl package which will be imported by the first line of function below.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(x -> year(x)*100 + month(x), df[:dt])\nend\n```\nThe function `add_yearmonth` takes a DataFrame as input and creates a new column `:ym` in the same DataFrame, where each element is an integer representing the year and month of the corresponding date in `:dt`. The year and month are obtained from the DateTimes using the `year` and `month` functions respectively. These functions return the respective components of the DateTime as integers, which are then multiplied by 100 to ensure they are concatenated correctly.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[Date(2022, 3, 15), Date(2021, 12, 31)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will create a new column `:ym` in the `df` DataFrame which contains the values [202303, 202112].","status":200,"tokens":[0,294],"elapsed":2.327805521,"_type":"aimessage"}]
