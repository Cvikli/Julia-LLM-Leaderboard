Firstly, we are using DataFrames package for dealing with dataframes and date-time operations.\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(x -> year(x)*100 + month(x), df[:dt])\n    return df\nend\n\n# Testing the function with the given dataframe\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis function `add_yearmonth` takes a DataFrame as input and adds a new column called `ym`. The map function iterates through the date-times in the `dt` column of the dataframe and extracts the year and month from each datetime. It then multiplies the year by 100 and concatenates it with the month to create a unique integer for each year and month.\nThe output will be:\n```julia\n#2000×3 DataFrame\n| Row | dt                  | ym    |\n|-----|---------------------|-------|\n| 1   | 2020-05-24T00:00:00 | 202005|\n| 2   | 2021-01-15T00:00:00 | 202101|\n| 3   | 2022-12-05T00:00:00 | 202212|\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,390],"elapsed":6.83995086,"_type":"aimessage"}]
