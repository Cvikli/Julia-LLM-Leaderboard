The values in this new column are calculated by mapping over the DateTime column `dt`. For each DateTime, we extract the year and month using the `year` and `month` functions from the Dates module and then concatenate them together with a multiplication of 100 (to shift the month into two digits).\n\nHere is an example usage:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=DateTime[now()-Month(i) for i in 1:5])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will create a new column `ym` with values like \"202206\" (for June, 2022).","status":200,"tokens":[0,236],"elapsed":4.026508355,"_type":"aimessage"}]
