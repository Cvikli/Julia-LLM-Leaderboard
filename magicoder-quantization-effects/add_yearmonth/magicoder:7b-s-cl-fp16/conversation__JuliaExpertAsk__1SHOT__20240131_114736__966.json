The first `map` function extracts the year from each DateTime and formats it as a string with \"y\". The second `map` function extracts the month from each DateTime and also formats it as a string with \"m\". These two strings are then concatenated together to form the new column `ym`.\n\nYou can use this function on your DataFrame like so:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=DateTime[]) # create an empty DataFrame\n# add some data to it...\nadd_yearmonth(df) # add a new column 'ym' to the DataFrame\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,271],"elapsed":4.685370544,"_type":"aimessage"}]
