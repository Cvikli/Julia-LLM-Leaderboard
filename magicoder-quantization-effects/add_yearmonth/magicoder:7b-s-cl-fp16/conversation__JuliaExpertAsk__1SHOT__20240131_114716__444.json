The `astype('int')` at the end is used to convert the string representation of the dates into integers.\n\nThe function will return a new DataFrame with an additional column `ym`.\n\nNote: This code assumes that your input DataFrame has a DateTime column named 'dt'. If your column name is different, you would need to replace `'dt'` with the correct column name in this code.","status":200,"tokens":[112,285],"elapsed":4.932637716,"_type":"aimessage"}]
