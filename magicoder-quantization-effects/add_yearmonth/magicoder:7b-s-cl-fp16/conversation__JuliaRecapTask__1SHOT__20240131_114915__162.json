[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

Here is a simple function that does what you asked for:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(x -> year(x)*100 + month(x), df.dt)\nend\n```\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df` as an argument and adds a new column `ym`. The values in this column are computed by mapping over the original `dt` column, applying the function that extracts the year and the month from each DateTime object, and then concatenating them into a single integer. \n\nFor example:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2021, 1, 1), DateTime(2022, 2, 29)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThe resulting DataFrame will have an additional column `ym` where the first row is `202101` and the second row is `202202`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,250],"elapsed":4.372914221,"_type":"aimessage"}]
