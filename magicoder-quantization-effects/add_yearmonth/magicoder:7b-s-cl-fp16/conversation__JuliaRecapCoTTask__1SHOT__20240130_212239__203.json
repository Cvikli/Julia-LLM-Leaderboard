[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

This function uses the built-in DateFormat.jl package to extract year and month from a DateTime object. \n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = [Date(dt).year * 100 + Date(dt).month for dt in df.dt]\nend\n```\n\nTo use this function:\n\n```julia\n# Create a DataFrame with DateTime column\ndf = DataFrame(dt=DateTime[now()+Month(i) for i in 1:3])\n\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n\n# Now df has an extra column ym which contains the year and month of each dt value as integers.\n```\n\nThis function works by creating a new column `ym` that contains the year and month of each DateTime in the DataFrame, concatenated together into one integer. The year is multiplied by 100 to ensure that it fits within an integer (since the year can be up to four digits).","status":200,"tokens":[0,240],"elapsed":4.174983165,"_type":"aimessage"}]
