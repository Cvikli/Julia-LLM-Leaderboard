[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

This function uses the built-in `Dates` module of Julia which provides functions for manipulating dates and times:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(x -> year(x)*100 + month(x), df.dt)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df` as input and adds a new column `ym` to it, where each value is the year of the corresponding date in `dt` concatenated with the month, separated by a hyphen. The `map` function applies a function (in this case, extracting the year and month from a DateTime) to every element in an array (in this case, every row of the DataFrame).\n\nYou can use it like this:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2021, 3, 1), DateTime(2022, 4, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will add a new column `ym` to the DataFrame with values [202103, 202204] respectively.","status":200,"tokens":[0,284],"elapsed":4.949641323,"_type":"aimessage"}]
