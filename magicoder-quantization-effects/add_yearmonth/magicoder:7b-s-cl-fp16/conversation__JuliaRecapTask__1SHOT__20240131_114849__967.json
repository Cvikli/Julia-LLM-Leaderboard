[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

The values in this new column are the years (extracted from the DateTimes with `year` function) multiplied by 100 and added to the months extracted from the same DateTimes with `month` function.\n\nHere is how you can use it:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[Date(2021,1,1), Date(2022,2,28)], other_column=[\"a\", \"b\"])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will add a new column `ym` to the DataFrame `df` with values 202101 and 202202 for the dates January 2021 and February 2022, respectively.","status":200,"tokens":[382,266],"elapsed":4.682283273,"_type":"aimessage"}]
