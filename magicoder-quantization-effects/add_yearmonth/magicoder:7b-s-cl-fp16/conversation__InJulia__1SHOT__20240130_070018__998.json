The \"dates\" package provides functions for manipulating dates and times which are very useful when working with DataFrames.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(x -> year(x)*100 + month(x), df[:dt])\nend\n```\nThe function `add_yearmonth` takes in a DataFrame and adds a new column (`:ym`) to it. This column is generated by mapping over the `:dt` column and extracting the year (via `year(x)`) and the month (via `month(x)`), converting these into an integer and concatenating them together with a multiplication of 100.\n\nHere's how you could use it:\n```julia\n# Assuming df is your DataFrame and dt column contains DateTime type data\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will add the `ym` column to your DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,228],"elapsed":3.955616679,"_type":"aimessage"}]
