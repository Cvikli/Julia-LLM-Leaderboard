The formatting string `\"YyyyM\"` is used to create a string representing the year and month of the date time in the format \"yyyyMM\". This resulting string is then converted into an integer with `Int`. Finally, this new integer column is added to the DataFrame using the assignment operator `:=` and returned. \n\nRemember that DataFrames are zero-indexed. If your `dt` column has DateTimes starting from 1st January 2000, then the first entry in the `ym` will be \"200001\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,258],"elapsed":4.483547632,"_type":"aimessage"}]
