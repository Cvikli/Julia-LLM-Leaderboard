In this case, we are applying the `Dates.format` function to each DateTime in the column `dt`, formatting it as \"yyyyMM\" (i.e., year and month) and storing the result in the new column `ym`.\n\nPlease note that you need to make sure your DataFrame `df` has a column named `dt` which is of type DateTime. If not, please adjust the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,187],"elapsed":3.223333458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
