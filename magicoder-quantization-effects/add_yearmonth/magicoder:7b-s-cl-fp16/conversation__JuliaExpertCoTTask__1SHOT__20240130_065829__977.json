The function `add_yearmonth` creates a new column 'ym' in the DataFrame by extracting year and month from 'dt'. It then concatenates these values into the format \"yyyymm\".\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(d -> Dates.format(d, \"yyyy\") * string(Dates.month(d)), df[:dt])\nend\n\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)],\n               dt_format=\"yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM:SS\")\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis code assumes that your DateTimes are stored in the 'dt' column as DateTime objects. The `add_yearmonth` function will create a new column 'ym' with values like \"20205\" for \"24-May-2020\", \"20211\" for \"15-Jan-2021\", and so on.\n\nPlease remember to install the required packages before running this code. You can add them to your environment by using `Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\")` and `Pkg.add(\"Dates\")`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,323],"elapsed":5.672148251,"_type":"aimessage"}]
