This code uses the DataFrames and Dates libraries to manipulate dataframes and dates.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map((x)->Year(x).value*100 + Month(x).value, df.dt)\nend\n\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis code defines a function `add_yearmonth` that takes in a DataFrame `df`. It then creates a new column `:ym` using the map function to apply a function to each element in the 'dt' column. This function extracts the year and month from the date, multiplies them together by 100 (to convert months to integers), and returns this value. This value is then added to the DataFrame.\n\nWhen you run `add_yearmonth(df)`, it will add a new column `:ym` to your dataframe with the desired output. The output for the provided data would look like:\n```julia\n1     20205\n2     20211\n3     202212\n```","status":200,"tokens":[282,310],"elapsed":19.249179674,"_type":"aimessage"}]
