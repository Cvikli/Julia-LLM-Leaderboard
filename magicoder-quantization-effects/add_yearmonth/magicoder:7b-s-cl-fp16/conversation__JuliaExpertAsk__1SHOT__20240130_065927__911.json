The values in the new column are strings that represent the year and month of each date from the original `:dt` column.\n\nThe `map()` function applies an anonymous function (defined using `x -> ...`) to each element in the DataFrame column `:dt`, transforming it into a string representing the year and month in the format \"yyyyMM\". The `Dates.format(x, \"yyyyMM\")` part does this.\n\nThe resulting DataFrame has two columns: `:ym` (containing strings of \"yyyyMM\" formatted dates), and `:dt` (the original DateTimes).","status":200,"tokens":[0,215],"elapsed":3.730380506,"_type":"aimessage"}]
