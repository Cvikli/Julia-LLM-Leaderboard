Pandas is a powerful data manipulation library built on top of NumPy and it allows us to quickly manipulate, analyze and visualize datasets. \n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef add_yearmonth(df):\n    df['ym'] = (df['dt'].dt.to_pydatetime().apply(lambda x: int(x.strftime('%Y%m'))))\n    return df\n```\nThis function takes a pandas DataFrame `df` as input and adds a new column 'ym' to the dataframe. \n\nThe .dt accessor is used to provide a rich set of string accessor methods for datetime dtype. The .apply() method applies a given function along axis on the element of the array. In this case, it formats each timestamp in the dt column as a string and converts that into an integer. The format code 'yyyymm' is used to represent the year and month as 'yyyyMM'.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```python\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\"dt\": [pd.Timestamp('2021-06-15'), pd.Timestamp('2020-07-14')]})\nprint(add_yearmonth(df))\n```\nThis will print:\n```python\n                 dt      ym\n0 2021-06-15 00:00:00  202106\n1 2020-07-14 00:00:00  202007\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,367],"elapsed":6.396067877,"_type":"aimessage"}]
