Here is how you can create such function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = [string(year(d), lpad(month(d), 2, '0')) for d in df.dt]\nend\n```\nThis function iterates over each element of `dt` column and extracts the year and month using the `year` and `month` functions from Dates package. The result is then converted to a string with the desired format (“yyyymm”) and added as a new column in the DataFrame.\n\nPlease note that this function modifies the input DataFrame (`df`) directly. If you want to avoid modifying it, consider creating a copy of the DataFrame before calling `add_yearmonth`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,202],"elapsed":3.492603018,"_type":"aimessage"}]
