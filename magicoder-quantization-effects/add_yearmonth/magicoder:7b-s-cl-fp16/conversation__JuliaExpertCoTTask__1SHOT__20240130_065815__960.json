Firstly, I would recommend adding the DataFrames package to your environment. You can do that using Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\").\n\nHere is a solution:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map((dt)->format(Date(dt), \"Y\") * format(Date(dt), \"m\"), df.dt)\n    return df\nend\n\n# Testing the function:\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis function `add_yearmonth` takes a DataFrame as an argument and adds a new column 'ym' to it. In this column, the year and month are extracted from the DateTime column 'dt', and then these two parts are concatenated together in the format \"yyyymm\". \n\nIn the test, the function is applied to a DataFrame with some dates, and the resulting DataFrame is printed out.","status":200,"tokens":[0,273],"elapsed":4.807874639,"_type":"aimessage"}]
