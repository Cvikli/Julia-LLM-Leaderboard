Please note that you need to have this package installed in order for this code to work.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(x -> Dates.format(x, \"yyyymm\"), df[:dt])\n    return df\nend\n```\nThis function takes a dataframe as input and adds a new column `ym` to it. The values in this new column are strings representing the year and month of each date in the original column `dt`. \n\nThe `map` function applies a function (in this case, `Dates.format`) to every value in the column `dt`. This function formats the date as \"yyyymm\".\n\nPlease note that you need to import the package `DataFrames` and `Dates` at the beginning of your code for this solution to work. You can do so by adding the following two lines at the top of your script:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nusing Dates\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,245],"elapsed":4.226293544,"_type":"aimessage"}]
