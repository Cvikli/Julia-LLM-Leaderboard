Then it maps over these DateTime objects to extract the year and month as strings, padding with zeros if necessary. Finally, it parses this string into an integer in \"yyyymm\" format and stores it in a new column `ym`.\n\nYou can use it like this:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will modify the `df` DataFrame in place to add a new column named `ym`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,269],"elapsed":4.6679906,"_type":"aimessage"}]
