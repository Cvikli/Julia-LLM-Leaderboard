The transformation is an anonymous function `(dt)->Date(dt, \"U\", DateFormat(\"y\")).year * 100 + Date(dt, \"U\", DateFormat(\"m\")).month`, which takes each DateTime and extracts the year and month components. It then combines these into a new integer format as specified.\n\nYou can call this function with your DataFrame like so: `add_yearmonth(df)`. Afterwards, you'll have a column named \"ym\" in your DataFrame that is an integer representing the year and month in the format “yyyymm”.","status":200,"tokens":[0,235],"elapsed":4.080038379,"_type":"aimessage"}]
