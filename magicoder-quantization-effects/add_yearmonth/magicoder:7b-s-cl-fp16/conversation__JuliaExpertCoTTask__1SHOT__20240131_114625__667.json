The values in this new column are generated by applying the `format` function on each value of the `:dt` column with the format string `\"yyyyMM\"`, which represents year and month in the format \"yyyymm\".\n\nYou can use the function like so:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThis will add a new column `:ym` to the dataframe `df`, with values \"202005\", \"202101\" and \"202212\".","status":200,"tokens":[282,246],"elapsed":18.255941851,"_type":"aimessage"}]
