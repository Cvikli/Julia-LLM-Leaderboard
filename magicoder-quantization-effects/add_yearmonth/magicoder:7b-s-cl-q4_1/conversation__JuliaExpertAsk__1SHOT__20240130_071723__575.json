This example assumes you have already added the DataFrames package to your environment.

The map function applies a mapping operation (which is specified by the anonymous function `(d::DateTime)->Dates.year(d)*100 + Dates.month(d)`) to every element of the `dt` column, which converts the DateTime into an integer representing year and month in format \"yyyymm\".\n\nYou can use this function like:\n```julia\n# assume df is your DataFrame\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,247],"elapsed":1.974134858,"_type":"aimessage"}]
