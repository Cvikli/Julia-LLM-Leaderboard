It uses list comprehension to create an array of the same length as the DataFrame, where each element is the year and month combined from the corresponding date in `dt`. The function assumes that `dt` is a DateTime column in your DataFrame.\n\nHere's how you can call this function:\n```julia\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,179],"elapsed":1.423822497,"_type":"aimessage"}]
