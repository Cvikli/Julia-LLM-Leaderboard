[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

This solution assumes that the date format is consistent with the DateTimes.Julia standard library.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = [Dates.year(x)*100 + Dates.month(x) for x in df.dt]\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThe code works by creating a new column `ym` where each element is the year (converted to an integer) plus 100 times the month, extracted from each datetime (`dt`) in the DataFrame (`df`).\n\nIf your date format has days as well, you can use this function instead:\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = [Dates.year(x)*100 + Dates.month(x) + (Dates.day(x)-1)*100 for x in df.dt]\n    return df\nend\n```\nIn this function, the day is also included in the calculation, but subtracted by 1 to get a valid month number (i.e., January=1 not January=0).","status":200,"tokens":[0,304],"elapsed":2.513045407,"_type":"aimessage"}]
