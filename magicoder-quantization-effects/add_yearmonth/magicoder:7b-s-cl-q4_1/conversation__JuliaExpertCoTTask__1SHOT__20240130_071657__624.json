The value of this new column is an integer representing the year and month from the DateTime column `dt`, concatenated in the format \"yyyymm\". The parsing into integers and joining them as a string again is done because we cannot have two different types (Int64 and String) in DataFrames.\n\nNow if you call your function with given data, it would look like:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nNote that the result will be DataFrame with added column `ym`.","status":200,"tokens":[282,326],"elapsed":6.999435313,"_type":"aimessage"}]
