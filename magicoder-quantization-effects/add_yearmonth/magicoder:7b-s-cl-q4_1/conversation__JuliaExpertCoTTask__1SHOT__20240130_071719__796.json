This column contains an integer representing the year and month of each date in format: “yyyymm”. For example for DateTime(2020, 5, 24), it would return 202055.\nPlease note that you need to have `DataFrames` package installed in your Julia environment. It can be added using Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\") if not already installed. Similarly, `Dates` is a built-in module in Julia and hence does not need any installation. \n\nThis solution assumes that you are familiar with the `DataFrame` structure of DataFrames and how to extract year and month from DateTime values. If this is new to you, I recommend looking up these functions in the official Julia documentation.","status":200,"tokens":[0,311],"elapsed":2.514270699,"_type":"aimessage"}]
