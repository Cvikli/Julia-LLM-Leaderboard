[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

Here is how you can create such a function using Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = [year(d) * 100 + month(d) for d in df.dt]\n    return df\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `year` and `month` functions from the Dates module to extract year and month information from each date-time object in your DataFrame's `dt` column, respectively. It then concatenates these numbers together into a new integer column called `ym`.\n\nFor instance:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[Date(2001, 1, 1), Date(2002, 2, 2)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nwill add a new column called `ym` to your DataFrame `df`, with values being the year and month of each date in the `dt` column concatenated into a single integer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,254],"elapsed":2.10038889,"_type":"aimessage"}]
