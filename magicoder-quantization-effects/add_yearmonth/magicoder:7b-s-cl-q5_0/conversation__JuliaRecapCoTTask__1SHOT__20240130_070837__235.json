[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

This solution assumes that the DataFrame column 'dt' contains DateTime type data and uses the Dates package of Julia to extract year and month from it.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map((x)->Dates.year(x)*100 + Dates.month(x), df[:dt])\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, for each row of DataFrame `df`, it uses the anonymous function to extract year and month from column 'dt', multiplies them together (which gives the year and month combined as an integer) and adds it to a new column 'ym'.\n\nThe Dates.year(x) function returns the year part of x, similarly for Dates.month(x).\n\nThis solution is straightforward but it assumes that all DateTime values in `df[:dt]` are valid (i.e., not missing or not NaT), otherwise you'd need to handle these cases as well. If this isn't the case then you may want to add a check for these conditions before applying the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,251],"elapsed":2.201007925,"_type":"aimessage"}]
