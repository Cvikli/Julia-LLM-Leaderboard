Here's how you can define your function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(x -> Dates.format(x, \"yyyyMM\"), df[:dt])\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a DataFrame as input and adds a new column `ym` to it. It uses the `map` function to apply a transformation (extracting year and month from each DateTime) to all elements in the `:dt` column of the DataFrame. The `Dates.format` function is used to format each date-time value as \"yyyyMM\", where yyyy represents the year, MM represents the month.","status":200,"tokens":[0,181],"elapsed":1.54941308,"_type":"aimessage"}]
