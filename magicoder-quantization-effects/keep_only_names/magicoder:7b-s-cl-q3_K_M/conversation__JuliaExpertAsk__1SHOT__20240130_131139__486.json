If a word starts with an uppercase letter (`isfirstuppercase(word)`), it adds this word to the `filtered_words` array. The function then returns the `filtered_words` array, which contains only words that start with an uppercase letter.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\"]\nprint(keep_only_names(words)) # prints: String[\"Dog\",\"Cat\"]\n```\nIn the above example, only words that start with a capital letter (\"Dog\" and \"Cat\") are kept.","status":200,"tokens":[0,284],"elapsed":2.206295969,"_type":"aimessage"}]
