[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is your solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Array{String})\n    new_list = String[]\n    for word in words\n        first_character = word[1]\n        if isuppercase(first_character)\n            push!(new_list, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return new_list\nend\n```\nIn this function, we loop over each string (word) in the input list. We check if the first character of each word (`word[1]`) is uppercase using `isuppercase` method. If it's true, then we push that word into our new list (`new_list`). At the end, we return the new list.\n\nYou can call this function with a list of words like so: \n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result) # Output: Any[\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[368,224],"elapsed":1.848346332,"_type":"aimessage"}]
