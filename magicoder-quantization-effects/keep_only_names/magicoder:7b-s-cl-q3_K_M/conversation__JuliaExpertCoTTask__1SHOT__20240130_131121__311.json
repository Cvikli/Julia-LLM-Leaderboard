The expression `isupper(word[1])` checks whether the first character of each string (word) is uppercase. If it is, that word is included in the new list; otherwise, it's not included.\n\nFor example, calling `keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])` would return `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`, since those are the only words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,176],"elapsed":1.363207263,"_type":"aimessage"}]
