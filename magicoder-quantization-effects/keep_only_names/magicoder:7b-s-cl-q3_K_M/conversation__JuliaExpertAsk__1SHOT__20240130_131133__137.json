The condition inside `filter!` checks if the first character of each word (accessed using `first(x)`) is uppercase (`isuppercase`). If it's not, that word is removed from the original `words` array.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nnames = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\"]\nfiltered_names = keep_only_names(names)\nprintln(filtered_names)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,201],"elapsed":1.556917516,"_type":"aimessage"}]
