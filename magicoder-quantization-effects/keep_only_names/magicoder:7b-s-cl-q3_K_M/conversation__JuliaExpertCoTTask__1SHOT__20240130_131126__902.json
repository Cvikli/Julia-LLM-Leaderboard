It checks whether the first character of a word (at index 1) is uppercase using `isupper`. If it's not, that word gets filtered out. The result is a new list with all words that start with a capital letter.\n\nNow let's test this function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))\n```\nThe output should be `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`, as these are the only words in the input list that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,198],"elapsed":1.533151678,"_type":"aimessage"}]
