[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, we can solve this problem by using the `startswith` function to check if each word starts with a capital letter. Here is how you could define such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return [word for word in words if startswith(word, uppercase(first(word)))]\nend\n```\nIn this function, `startswith` checks if the first character of `word` is equal to its uppercase version. If it is, then `uppercase(first(word))` will be true, and `startswith` will return true for that word. Therefore, only words where the first letter is a capital letter are kept in the resulting list.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\"]\nkeep_only_names(words)  # returns [\"Dog\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,201],"elapsed":1.579346776,"_type":"aimessage"}]
