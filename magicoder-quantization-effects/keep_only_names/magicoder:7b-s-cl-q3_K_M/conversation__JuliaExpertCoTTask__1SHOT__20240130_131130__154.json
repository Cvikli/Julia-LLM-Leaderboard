It removes all the elements for which the given function (here, it's a lambda function checking if the first character of string is uppercase) returns false. The function `isuppercase` checks whether the given character is uppercase or not.\n\nLet's test this function with your data:\n```julia\nprint(keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]))\n```\nThe output of the code would be `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,194],"elapsed":1.50374017,"_type":"aimessage"}]
