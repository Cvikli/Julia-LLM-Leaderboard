[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this task using the following function in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    result = [] # an empty list to store the final results\n    \n    for word in words\n        if isfirstuppercase(word)\n            push!(result, word)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n\nfunction isfirstuppercase(s::AbstractString)\n    return s[1] == uppercase(s[1]) && !isempty(s)\nend\n```\nIn this solution, the function `keep_only_names` iterates over each word in the provided list. If a word starts with a capital letter (as determined by the helper function `isfirstuppercase`), it's added to the result list (`result`). The final list is then returned as the output of the function.\n\nThe helper function `isfirstuppercase` checks if a string s starts with an uppercase letter. It does this by checking if the first character of s is equal to its uppercase version and also making sure that the string is not empty.","status":200,"tokens":[0,242],"elapsed":1.873066516,"_type":"aimessage"}]
