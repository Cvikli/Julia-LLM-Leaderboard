The `uppercase` function converts the first character of the word to uppercase, and `first` retrieves the first character of the word.\n\nYou can call this function with an array of strings:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"DOG\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln.(filtered_words)\n```\nThis will print:\n```julia\n[\"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"DOG\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[98,218],"elapsed":1.755764179,"_type":"aimessage"}]
