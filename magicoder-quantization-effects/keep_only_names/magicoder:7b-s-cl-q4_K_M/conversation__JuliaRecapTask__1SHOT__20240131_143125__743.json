[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function in Julia to solve this problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    result = String[]  # Initialize an empty array of Strings\n    for word in words   # Iterate over each word in the provided list\n        if isuppercase(word[1])  # Check if the first character of the word is uppercase (a capital letter)\n            push!(result, word)  # If it is, add the word to the result array\n        end\n    end\n    return result  # Return the result array which now contains only words that start with a capital letter\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each word in the provided list and checking if the first character of the word (at index 1) is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function. If it is, then we add the word to our result array. At the end, we return this result array which only contains words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,218],"elapsed":1.770599858,"_type":"aimessage"}]
