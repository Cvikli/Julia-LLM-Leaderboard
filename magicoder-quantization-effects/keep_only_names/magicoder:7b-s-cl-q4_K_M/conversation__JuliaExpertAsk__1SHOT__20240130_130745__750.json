For each word, it checks whether the first character (at index 1 because indexing in Julia is 1-based not 0-based like in many other programming languages) of the word is uppercase using the `isuppercase` built-in function. If this condition is true (meaning that the word starts with a capital letter), it adds the word to the result array using the `push!` function. Finally, it returns the result array which contains only words starting with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,195],"elapsed":1.576700161,"_type":"aimessage"}]
