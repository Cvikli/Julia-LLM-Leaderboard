If the word does start with a capital letter, it is added to the `result` array. Finally, this array containing only words that start with a capital letter is returned.\n\nYou can test this function using your example data:\n\n```julia\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])) # Output: [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[231,208],"elapsed":3.322466677,"_type":"aimessage"}]
