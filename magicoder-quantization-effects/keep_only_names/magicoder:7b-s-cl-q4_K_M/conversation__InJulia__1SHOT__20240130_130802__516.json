The `isuppercase(first(x))` part checks if the first character of each string is uppercase (i.e., it starts with a capital letter).\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"elephant\", \"Elephant\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words) # prints: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\n\nThis function will return an array of strings that only contains the words starting with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,232],"elapsed":1.860309764,"_type":"aimessage"}]
