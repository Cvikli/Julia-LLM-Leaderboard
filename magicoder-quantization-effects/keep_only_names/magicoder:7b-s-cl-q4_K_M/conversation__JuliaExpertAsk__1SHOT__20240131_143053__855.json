The loop iterates over each word in the input list `words`. If the first letter of the word is not lowercase (i.e., it's uppercase), then we add this word to the result array. Finally, we return the result array, which contains only words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,225],"elapsed":1.790082423,"_type":"aimessage"}]
