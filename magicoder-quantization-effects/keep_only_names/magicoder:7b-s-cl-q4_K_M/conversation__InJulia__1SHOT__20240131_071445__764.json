For each word, it checks whether the first character (at index 1 because indexing in Julia starts from 1) is an uppercase letter using the built-in `isuppercase` function. If it is, the word is added to the result array. Finally, the result array is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,156],"elapsed":1.229691761,"_type":"aimessage"}]
