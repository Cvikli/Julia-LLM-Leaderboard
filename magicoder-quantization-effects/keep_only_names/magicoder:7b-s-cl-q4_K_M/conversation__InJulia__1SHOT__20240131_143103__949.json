The anonymous function checks if the first character of each string is a capital letter using the `uppercase` function and compares it with the first character of the same string, which we assume will be the same as its lowercase version since we're filtering on starting with a capital letter. \n\nYou can call this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\", \"dog\", \"DOG\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)\n# Outputs: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"DOG\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,217],"elapsed":1.718293321,"_type":"aimessage"}]
