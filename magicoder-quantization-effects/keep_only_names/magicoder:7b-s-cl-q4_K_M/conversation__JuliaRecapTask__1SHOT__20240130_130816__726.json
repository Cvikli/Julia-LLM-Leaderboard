[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you could write this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return [word for word in words if first(word) == uppercase(first(word))]\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a list comprehension to create a new list that only includes the words from the original list where the first character of each word is a capital letter. The `first` and `uppercase` functions are used here to check if the first character of the string is a capital letter, as Julia is case-sensitive.\n\nPlease note that this function will return an error if it receives an empty array. If you want to handle this edge case, you could modify your function like so:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    isempty(words) && return words  # return the original list if it's already empty\n    return [word for word in words if first(word) == uppercase(first(word))]\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,223],"elapsed":1.820503593,"_type":"aimessage"}]
