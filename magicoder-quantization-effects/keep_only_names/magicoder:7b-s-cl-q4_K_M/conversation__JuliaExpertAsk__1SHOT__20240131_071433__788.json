The `isuppercase(first(x))` part checks if the first character of a string (which we assume is a single word due to the context) is an uppercase letter. If it is, the word is included in the output; otherwise, it's removed.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Doggy\", \"Catty\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words) # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Doggy\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,202],"elapsed":1.602290535,"_type":"aimessage"}]
