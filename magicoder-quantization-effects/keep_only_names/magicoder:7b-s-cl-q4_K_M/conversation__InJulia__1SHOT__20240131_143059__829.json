The `uppercase(first(word))` is used to check if the first character of each word is uppercase, and the `==` operator checks for equality. If it's true (meaning the first character is uppercase), then the word is included in the new list.","status":200,"tokens":[0,142],"elapsed":1.122805779,"_type":"aimessage"}]
