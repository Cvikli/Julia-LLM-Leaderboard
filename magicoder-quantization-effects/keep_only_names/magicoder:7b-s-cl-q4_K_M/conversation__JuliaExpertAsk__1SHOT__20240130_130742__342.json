The anonymous function checks whether the first character in each word is an uppercase letter using the `isuppercase` built-in Julia function.\n\nYou can use it like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"bird\", \"Duck\", \"DOG\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln.(filtered_words)  # Outputs: Dog, Duck, DOG\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,192],"elapsed":1.563990836,"_type":"aimessage"}]
