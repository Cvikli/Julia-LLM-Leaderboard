The `filter` function is used to create a new array with elements that fulfill the condition specified by the function it's given (in this case, checking if the first character of each string is uppercase). If it is, then the string gets added to the new array; otherwise, it doesn't. The `uppercase` function is used to convert a letter to its uppercase version.\n\nThe output would be:\n```\nFiltered words: [\"Cat\", \"DOG\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,243],"elapsed":1.947511498,"_type":"aimessage"}]
