It checks whether the first character of each word is a lowercase letter using the `islowercase` function, and only includes that word in the result if it is indeed a lowercase letter.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"apple\", \"Cat\", \"Apple\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Prints: [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,185],"elapsed":1.466676355,"_type":"aimessage"}]
