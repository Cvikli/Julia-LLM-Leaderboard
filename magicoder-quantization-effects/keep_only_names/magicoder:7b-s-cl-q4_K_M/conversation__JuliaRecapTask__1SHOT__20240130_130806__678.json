[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can solve this problem by creating a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words and checks if each word starts with a capital letter using regex to match any uppercase character (`^[A-Z]`) followed by zero or more alphanumeric characters (`[A-Za-z0-9]*`). If the word does not start with a capital letter, it is removed from the list. \n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions\n\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # filter words that start with an uppercase letter (^[A-Z] means any uppercase character at the beginning of a word, [A-Za-z0-9]* means zero or more alphanumeric characters following it)\n    return [word for word in words if match(r\"^[A-Z][A-Za-z0-9]*\", word)]\nend\n```\n\nYou can use the function like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\", \"Horse\", \"horse\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln.(filtered_words)  # prints: Cat Horse\n```\n\nThis will print only the words that start with a capital letter as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[368,308],"elapsed":2.612629721,"_type":"aimessage"}]
