The condition `isupper(first(word))` checks whether the first character of the word (which is assumed to be a single Unicode character) is an uppercase letter. If it is, the word is included in the output; otherwise, it is not.\n\nNote that `isupper` returns true if and only if its argument is an uppercase letter at the beginning of a string. The function `first(s)` returns the first (and in this case only) character of the string `s`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,170],"elapsed":1.379676811,"_type":"aimessage"}]
