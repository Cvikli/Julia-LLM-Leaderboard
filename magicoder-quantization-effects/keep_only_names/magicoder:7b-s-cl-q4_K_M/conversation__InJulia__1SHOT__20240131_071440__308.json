The `isuppercase(first(x))` part checks if the first character of a word (which is assumed to be the only character if it's a single-character string) is uppercase. If it is, that word is included in the output; otherwise, it is discarded.","status":200,"tokens":[68,126],"elapsed":1.017798258,"_type":"aimessage"}]
