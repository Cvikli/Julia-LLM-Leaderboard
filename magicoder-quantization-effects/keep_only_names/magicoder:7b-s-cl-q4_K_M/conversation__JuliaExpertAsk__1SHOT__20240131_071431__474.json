If the first character of a word (`first(word)`) is an uppercase letter, it's included in the new list; otherwise, it's ignored.\n\nYou can call this function with a list of words like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"dog\", \"Cat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Outputs: [\"Dog\", \"Bird\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,193],"elapsed":1.526090376,"_type":"aimessage"}]
