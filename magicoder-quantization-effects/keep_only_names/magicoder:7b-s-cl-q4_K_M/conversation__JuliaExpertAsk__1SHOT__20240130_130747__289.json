The `isuppercase` function checks if the first character of a string (word[1]) is an uppercase letter, and if so it includes that word in the new list. This effectively filters out any words that do not start with a capital letter.\n\nPlease note that this function only works correctly with English language words as it relies on the Unicode specification for identifying upper- and lowercase letters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,155],"elapsed":1.253171304,"_type":"aimessage"}]
