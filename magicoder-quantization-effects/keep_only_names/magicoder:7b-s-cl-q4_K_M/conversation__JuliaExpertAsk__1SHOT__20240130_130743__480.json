If it is, it returns `true` and that word will be kept in the list. Otherwise, it returns `false` and the word will be removed from the final list.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"elephant\", \"Elephant\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprint(filtered_words)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,181],"elapsed":1.475648488,"_type":"aimessage"}]
