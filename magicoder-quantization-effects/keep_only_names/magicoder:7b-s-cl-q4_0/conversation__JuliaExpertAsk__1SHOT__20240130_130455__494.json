It uses list comprehension (the `[... for ... in ...]` syntax) to create a new list that only includes words which satisfy this condition. \n\nFor example, if you call `keep_only_names([\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\"])`, it will return `[\"Dog\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,148],"elapsed":1.116611063,"_type":"aimessage"}]
