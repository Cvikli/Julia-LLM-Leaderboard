The `islowercase` function checks if the first character of a string is lowercase.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\"]\nkeep_only_names(words)\n```\nThis will return `[\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]` as it removes words that do not start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,175],"elapsed":1.311717479,"_type":"aimessage"}]
