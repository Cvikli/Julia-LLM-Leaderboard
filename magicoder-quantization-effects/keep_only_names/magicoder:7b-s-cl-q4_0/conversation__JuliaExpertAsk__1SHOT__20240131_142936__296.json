This function uses a list comprehension to filter out any word that does not start with an uppercase character:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return [word for word in words if isuppercase(word[1])]\nend\n```\nThis function takes as input a list of strings (`words`), and returns a new list that contains only those words from the original list that start with an uppercase letter. The `isuppercase` function checks whether a character (in this case, the first character of a word) is uppercase. \n\nFor example, if you call `keep_only_names([\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"lion\"])`, it will return `[\"Dog\", \"Elephant\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,183],"elapsed":1.375766012,"_type":"aimessage"}]
