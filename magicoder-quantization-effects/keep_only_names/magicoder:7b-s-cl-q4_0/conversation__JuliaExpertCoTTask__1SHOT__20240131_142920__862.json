The `isuppercase(first(x))` part checks if the first character of each string (`x`) in the list is an uppercase letter. If it is, the element stays in the list; otherwise, it gets removed.\n\nYou can call this function with your data like this:\n```julia\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])\n```\nThis will return `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`, which are the words in the provided list that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,191],"elapsed":1.444168689,"_type":"aimessage"}]
