The `filter` function applies a condition (in this case, checking if the first character of a string is a capital letter) and keeps only those words that satisfy the condition. \n\nThe `uppercase(x[1])` part ensures that we are checking for a capital letter at the start of each word, not just any uppercase letters anywhere in the word.","status":200,"tokens":[68,146],"elapsed":1.110022433,"_type":"aimessage"}]
