[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function in Julia to solve this problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return [word for word in words if first(word) isupper()]\nend\n```\nIn the above code, we define a function `keep_only_names` that takes an array of strings (words). Inside the function, we use Julia's comprehension to iterate over each element in the array. We check whether the first character of each word is uppercase using the built-in `first` and `isupper` functions. If it is, we keep that word in our final result; if not, we discard it. The result is a new array with only those words that start with an uppercase letter.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"frog\"]\nkeep_only_names(words)\n```\nThis would return `[\"Dog\", \"Elephant\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,224],"elapsed":1.726976356,"_type":"aimessage"}]
