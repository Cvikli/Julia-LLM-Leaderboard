The `x -> x[1] == uppercase(x[1])` part checks if the first character of each word in the list is the same as its uppercase version (which would indicate it's a capital letter).\n  \nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bear\", \"Elephant\", \"doggies\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Outputs: [\"Dog\", \"Bear\", \"Elephant\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,217],"elapsed":1.629101512,"_type":"aimessage"}]
