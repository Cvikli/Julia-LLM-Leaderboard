If the first character of a word is a capital letter (either ASCII ('A' to 'Z') or Unicode star symbol '\\u2620'), it is added to `newWords`. The function then returns this updated array. \n\nNote that you could also use `filter` and `startswith` functions for cleaner code:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Array{String,1})\n    return filter(w -> startswith(uppercase(w), 'A') || startswith(w, '\\u2620'), words)\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,293],"elapsed":2.191979288,"_type":"aimessage"}]
