The condition in the loop is that the first character of each word must be capital (`uppercase(word[1])`), and the string after stripping whitespace characters cannot be empty. If these conditions are met, the word is included in the returned list.\n\nTo use this function, you would pass it a list of words like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"\", \" \"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words)) # prints [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Elephant\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,210],"elapsed":1.585253662,"_type":"aimessage"}]
