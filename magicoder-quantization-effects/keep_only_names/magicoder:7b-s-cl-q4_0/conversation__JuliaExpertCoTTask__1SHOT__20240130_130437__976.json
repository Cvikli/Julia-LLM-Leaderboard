[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

It does this by iterating over the provided list, checking if the first character of each word is uppercase, and then adding it to the new list if it is. The function finally returns the new list.\n\nThe `isuppercase` function in Julia checks if a given character is an uppercase letter. When we call `word[1]` with `word` as `\"Dog\"`, it gives `'D'`. And `'D'` is indeed an uppercase letter, so our condition becomes true and \"Dog\" gets added to the new list.","status":200,"tokens":[0,229],"elapsed":1.754370132,"_type":"aimessage"}]
