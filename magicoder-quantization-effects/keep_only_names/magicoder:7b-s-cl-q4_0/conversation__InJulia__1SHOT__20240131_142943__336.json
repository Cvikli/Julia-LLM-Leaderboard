This function uses a generator comprehension to filter out any word from `words` which does not begin with an uppercase letter:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return [word for word in words if isuppercase(word[1])]\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each word in the `words` list and checking if the first character of the word (`word[1]`) is uppercase. If it is, the word is included in the result. Otherwise, it's ignored. \n\nExample usage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"elephant\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words) # Outputs: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Elephant\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,211],"elapsed":1.582504557,"_type":"aimessage"}]
