[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is the solution written in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Array{String})\n    result = String[]\n    \n    for word in words\n        # Check if a word starts with an uppercase letter\n        if isuppercase(word[1])\n            push!(result, word)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing your list of strings to it:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprint(filtered_words)  # Outputs: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```\n\nThe function `keep_only_names` takes an array of strings as input and returns a new array with only the words that start with an uppercase letter. It achieves this by iterating over each word in the provided list, checking if it starts with an uppercase letter using the built-in `isuppercase` function in Julia, and if so, adding it to the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,250],"elapsed":1.923906805,"_type":"aimessage"}]
