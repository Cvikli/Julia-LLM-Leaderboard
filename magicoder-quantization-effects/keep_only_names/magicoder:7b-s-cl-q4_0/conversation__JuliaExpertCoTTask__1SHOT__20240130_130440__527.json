We check if the first character of a word is uppercase (which means it starts with a capital letter) and then add that to the newWords array. Finally, we return the newWords array which contains only words that start with a capital letter.\n\nWhen you run this code with input `[\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]`, it will output `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]` because those are the only two words in the list that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,231],"elapsed":1.768705964,"_type":"aimessage"}]
