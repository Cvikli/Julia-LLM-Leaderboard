The condition here is that the first character of each word should be a capital letter. \n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words) # prints [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,162],"elapsed":1.220640696,"_type":"aimessage"}]
