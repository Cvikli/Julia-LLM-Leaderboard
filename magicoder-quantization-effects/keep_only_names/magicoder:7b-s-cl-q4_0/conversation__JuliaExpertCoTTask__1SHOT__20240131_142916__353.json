The `filter` function applies a predicate (a Boolean function that returns true or false for each element of an array) to the elements of the array and constructs a new array that includes only those elements where the predicate is true.\n\nThe predicate checks if the first character of a word (`word[1]`) is uppercase using `isuppercase`. If it's not, the function removes this word from the list.\n\nYou can use this function with your example:\n\n```julia\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,208],"elapsed":1.574062509,"_type":"aimessage"}]
