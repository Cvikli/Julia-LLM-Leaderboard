This program defines a function `keep_only_names` which takes an array of strings as input. It then uses the built-in `startswith` function to check if each word starts with a capital letter, and only keeps words that do.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(x -> isuppercase(first(x)), words)\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `filter` function provided by Julia to iterate over each word in the input list, and the `isuppercase` function to check if the first character of a string is an uppercase letter. The `startswith` function could also be used instead of `first`. \n\nHere's how you can call this function:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words) # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,229],"elapsed":1.698769937,"_type":"aimessage"}]
