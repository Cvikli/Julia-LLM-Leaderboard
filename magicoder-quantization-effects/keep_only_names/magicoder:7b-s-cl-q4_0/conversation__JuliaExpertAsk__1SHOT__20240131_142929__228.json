The `isuppercase(first(x))` part checks if the first character of a string `x` is an uppercase letter. If it is, then the string is included in the output. Otherwise, it's removed.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bear\", \"doggy\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Bear\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,180],"elapsed":1.351553917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
