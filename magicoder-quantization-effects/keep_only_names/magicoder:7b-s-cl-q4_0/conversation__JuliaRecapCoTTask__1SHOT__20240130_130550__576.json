[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem in Julia by using comprehensions to filter out the words which don't start with an uppercase letter. Here is how you can do it:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    [word for word in words if isupper(word[1])]\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each `word` in the list of `words`. For each `word`, it checks whether the first character (`word[1]`) is an uppercase letter using `isupper`. If it is, it adds that `word` to the new list. Otherwise, it ignores it. The comprehension `[word for word in words if condition]` creates a new list that contains only those elements of `words` for which `condition` holds true.\n  \nIf you need to consider special instructions, let's say we want to handle words with non-alphabetic characters or words that contain apostrophes as well:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    [word for word in words if isuppercase(first(filter(!isletter, collect(word))))]\nend\n```\nThis version uses the function `filter` to remove non-alphabetic characters from the string (with the help of `collect`), then checks whether the resulting string only contains uppercase letters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,294],"elapsed":2.277362297,"_type":"aimessage"}]
