The `isuppercase` function checks if the first character of a string (word) is an uppercase letter, and if it is, the word is kept. \n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words) # Prints: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,169],"elapsed":1.268534763,"_type":"aimessage"}]
