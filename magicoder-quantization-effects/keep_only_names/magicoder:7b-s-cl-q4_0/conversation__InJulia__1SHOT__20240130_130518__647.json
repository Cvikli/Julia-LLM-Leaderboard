If the first character of a `word` is not an uppercase letter or if the `word` only has one character (and it's not \"I\" or \"a\" or other single-letter words), then the `word` is added to the result.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\", \"bunny\", \"Bunny\", \"I\", \"A\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words)) # prints [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Bunny\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,372],"elapsed":2.797067472,"_type":"aimessage"}]
