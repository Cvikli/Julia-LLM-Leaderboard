[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here is an example in Julia language for your task:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words) \n    filter(x -> isuppercase(first(x)), words)\nend\n```\nThis function takes a list of strings (`words`) as input, and returns a new list containing only the elements that start with an uppercase letter. The `filter` function goes through each element in the `words` array, checks if the first character is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function, and includes it in the resulting array if true. If not, it skips this word.\n\nIf you have a list of names as strings:\n```julia\nnames = [\"Alice\", \"Dog\", \"Eve\", \"Bob\"]\nfiltered_names = keep_only_names(names)\n```\n`filtered_names` would be `[\"Alice\", \"Eve\", \"Bob\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,207],"elapsed":1.600679163,"_type":"aimessage"}]
