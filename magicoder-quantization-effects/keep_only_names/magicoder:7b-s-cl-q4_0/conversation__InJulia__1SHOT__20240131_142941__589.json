Here, the condition checks if the first character of each string (`x`) is equal to its uppercase version (`uppercase(x[1])`). All strings that satisfy this condition will be kept in the array. \n\nYou can use it like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\"]\nkeep_only_names(words)\n```\nThis would output `[\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,179],"elapsed":1.342491554,"_type":"aimessage"}]
