[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words) \n    filter(x -> first(x) == uppercase(first(x)), words)\nend\n```\nIn this solution, I use a combination of `filter` function which applies a condition to each element in the array and only keeps the elements for which the condition is true. And `uppercase` function to convert the first letter of the string to uppercase. \n\nNote: The problem statement mentions \"capital letters\" but does not specify what should happen if there are lower case initial characters, like 'dog', 'Dog' etc., so I assume that such cases must be removed. If all words in the list are in camelCase or PascalCase (with capital letter at start of each word), then we need to modify the function slightly:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words) \n    filter(x -> isuppercase(first(x)), words)\nend\n```\nIn this case, `isuppercase` checks if a character in a string is uppercase.","status":200,"tokens":[11,243],"elapsed":1.887289263,"_type":"aimessage"}]
