The condition given to the `filter!` function checks whether the first character of each word in the list is an uppercase letter. If it is, that word is kept; if not, it is removed from the list.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\", \"doggo\", \"Bear\"]\nkeep_only_names(words)\n```\nOutput: `[\"Dog\", \"Bear\"]`","status":200,"tokens":[0,170],"elapsed":1.277101203,"_type":"aimessage"}]
