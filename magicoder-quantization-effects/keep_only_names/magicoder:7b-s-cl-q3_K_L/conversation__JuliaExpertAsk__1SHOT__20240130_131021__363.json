If the first character of a word is a capitalized letter (which can be checked using `uppercase(word[1])`), and if the length of the string is more than 1 (since we should exclude single-character words), then it's appended to the result array.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words)) # Output: [\"Dog\",\"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,217],"elapsed":1.734395604,"_type":"aimessage"}]
