The `isuppercase` function checks if the first character of the word (obtained using the `first` function) is uppercase, and `filter` applies this predicate to all elements in `words`, keeping only those for which it returns `true`.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"house\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words)) # Output: [\"Cat\",\"Dog\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,184],"elapsed":1.463972596,"_type":"aimessage"}]
