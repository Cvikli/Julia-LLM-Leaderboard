[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The instructions can be customized to modify the function behavior. Here is an example:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    result = String[]  # initialize a new array of strings\n\n    for word in words  # iterate over all words in the input list\n        if occursin(\"^[A-Z]\", word)  # use regex to check if the word starts with uppercase letters\n            push!(result, word)  # if it does, add it to result array\n        end\n    end\n\n    return result  # return the final result array\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each word in the input list and checking if that word starts with a capital letter (as indicated by the regular expression `^[A-Z]`). If it does, we add it to our `result` array. Finally, we return this resulting array which contains all the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nNote: The function above assumes that the input is an Array of strings. Make sure to check and handle exceptions accordingly if it's not always the case.","status":200,"tokens":[0,241],"elapsed":2.055994879,"_type":"aimessage"}]
