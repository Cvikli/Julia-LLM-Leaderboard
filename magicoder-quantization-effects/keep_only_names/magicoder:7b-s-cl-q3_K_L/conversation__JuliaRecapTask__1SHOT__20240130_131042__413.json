X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, we can solve this task using filter function. The filter function is available in the Base package and it takes a function and an iterable as input. It returns a new iterator that filters elements of the original collection based on the provided function.\n\nBelow is how you can create such function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filter!(x -> first(x) isa AbstractChar && isupper(first(x)), words)\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, `filter!` function iterates over the elements of `words`, and `x -> first(x) isa AbstractChar && isupper(first(x))` is a function that checks if a word starts with an uppercase letter. If the condition is true, it keeps the element in the result. The `isupper` function from Base returns true if all the characters of the string are upper case. \n\nYou can use this function like this:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words) # prints [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,263],"elapsed":2.158140992,"_type":"aimessage"}]
