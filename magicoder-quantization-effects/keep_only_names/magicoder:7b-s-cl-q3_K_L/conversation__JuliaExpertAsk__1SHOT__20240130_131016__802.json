The `uppercase` function is used to convert the first character of each word to uppercase, and it will only pass for those words where this comparison is true.\n\nTo test it:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"elephant\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprint(filtered_words) # Prints: [\"Cat\", \"Dog\"]\n```\nAs you can see, all words that start with a capital letter are kept and those which do not start with a capital letter are removed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,218],"elapsed":1.742159615,"_type":"aimessage"}]
