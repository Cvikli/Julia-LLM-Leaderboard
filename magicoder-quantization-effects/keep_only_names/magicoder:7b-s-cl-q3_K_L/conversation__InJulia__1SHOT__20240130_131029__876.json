The `isuppercase` function checks if a character (in this case, the first character of the string) is uppercase, and `first` gets the first character of the string. \n\nYou can call this function like this: \n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words) # Outputs: [\"Dog\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,170],"elapsed":1.351213183,"_type":"aimessage"}]
