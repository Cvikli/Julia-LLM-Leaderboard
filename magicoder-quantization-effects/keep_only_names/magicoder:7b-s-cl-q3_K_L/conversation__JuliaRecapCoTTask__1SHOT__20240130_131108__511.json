[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem in Julia using the `startswith` function to check if the first character of each word is uppercase. Here's how you could do it:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filter(word -> startswith(word, uppercase(first(word))), words)\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `filter` function provided by Julia to iterate over each word in the input list and apply a condition. The `startswith` function checks if the first few characters of the string match another string, while `uppercase(first(word))` gets the first character of the string and makes it uppercase (this is equivalent to checking whether the first character is an uppercase letter). The result of this check is a boolean value that indicates whether the word should be kept or not. This condition is applied using the logical OR operator (`||`) in conjunction with `any` to return true if at least one element in the list matches the condition, false otherwise.","status":200,"tokens":[0,217],"elapsed":1.777565994,"_type":"aimessage"}]
