[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can achieve this by using the `startswith` function from the Base package. The `startswith` function checks if a string starts with certain characters. Here is how you can implement `keep_only_names`:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Create an empty list to store the words that start with a capital letter\n    capital_letters = []\n    \n    # Loop over each word in the input array\n    for word in words\n        if startswith(word, uppercasefirst(word[1])) && islowercase(word[2:end]) \n            push!(capital_letters, word)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Return the list of capital letters\n    return capital_letters\nend\n```\nThis function works by checking if each word starts with a capital letter. The `startswith` function checks this. It also checks that all subsequent characters are in lowercase, as required by our problem statement (to ensure words like \"Dog\" are excluded but not words like \"dog\").\n\nThe special instructions can be applied here, and the function should be updated accordingly to meet those requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,260],"elapsed":2.291085585,"_type":"aimessage"}]
