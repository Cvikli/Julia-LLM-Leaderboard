For each word, we use `islowercase` function which checks if a character is lower case. If the first letter of the word is not in lower case (i.e., it's a capital letter), we push that word to our new list (`newWords`). Finally, we return this new list.","status":200,"tokens":[0,211],"elapsed":1.797966435,"_type":"aimessage"}]
