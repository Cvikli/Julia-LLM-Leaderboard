The function uses a comprehension to filter out only those words which start with an uppercase letter.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return [word for word in words if first(word) == uppercase(first(word))]\nend\n```\nThe `uppercase` function converts the first character of a string to uppercase, while `first` gets the first character of a string. The comprehension checks if the first character of each word is an uppercase letter; if it is, the word is included in the new list.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"Elephant\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Outputs: Cat Dog Elephant\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,204],"elapsed":1.743539983,"_type":"aimessage"}]
