Here, we use `islowercase` function on the first character of each word to check if it is a lowercase letter. If it's not a lowercase letter (which means it's a capitalized name), then we keep that word in our final result.","status":200,"tokens":[98,141],"elapsed":1.235984891,"_type":"aimessage"}]
