[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can achieve this by using Julia's in-built `startswith` function to check if the first character of each word is uppercase. The code would look like:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filter(word -> startswith(word, uppercase(word[1])), words)\nend\n```\nThis `keep_only_names` function uses the built-in `filter` function from Julia's standard library to create a new list that only includes the words from the input list where the word starts with an uppercase letter. The `startswith(word, uppercase(word[1]))` is used to check if a word starts with an uppercase letter by comparing the first character of each word (accessed using `word[1]`) to its uppercase version.\n\nYou can call this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\"]\nnew_list = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(new_list)\n```\nThis will output:\n`[\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]`, which are the words that start with an uppercase letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,259],"elapsed":2.277422438,"_type":"aimessage"}]
