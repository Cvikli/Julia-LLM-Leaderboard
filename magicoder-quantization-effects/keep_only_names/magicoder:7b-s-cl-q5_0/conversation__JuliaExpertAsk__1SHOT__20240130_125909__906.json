The condition is defined as an anonymous function (a function without a name), that checks whether the first character of each word in `words` is within the range 'A' to 'Z'. If it is, then the word is kept; otherwise, it is removed from the list.\n\nHere's how you can call this function:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"fish\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # prints [\"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"Elephant\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,210],"elapsed":1.803776437,"_type":"aimessage"}]
