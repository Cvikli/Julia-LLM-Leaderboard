[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can achieve this using Julia:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # filter function to check if a word starts with capital letter\n    check_cap = (word) -> length(word) > 0 && isuppercase(word[1])\n    \n    # filter the list using the above function\n    return filter(check_cap, words)\nend\n```\nThis function uses Julia's built-in `filter` function to create a new list that only contains the words from `words` which start with a capital letter. The check for this is done in the anonymous function passed to `filter`. It checks if the first character of each word (checked using `isuppercase`) is upper case (`length(word) > 0`), thus ensuring it starts with a capital letter. If this check passes, then the word is included in the new list; otherwise, it's excluded.","status":200,"tokens":[368,206],"elapsed":1.712866455,"_type":"aimessage"}]
