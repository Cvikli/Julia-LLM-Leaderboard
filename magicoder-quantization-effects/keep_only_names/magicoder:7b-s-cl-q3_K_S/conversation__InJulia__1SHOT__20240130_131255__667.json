Here is how you can write the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    new_list = [word for word in words if startswith(word, uppercase(first(word)))]\n    return new_list\nend\n```\nThis function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the provided list of words and constructs a new list that only includes words that start with an uppercase letter. The `startswith` method in Julia checks if a string starts with the specified prefix, so we pass the uppercased first character of each word as the prefix to check if it is the starting letter of any word.\n\nNote: In case you want to check for lowercase letters at the start also then you would need to modify this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,194],"elapsed":1.516984976,"_type":"aimessage"}]
