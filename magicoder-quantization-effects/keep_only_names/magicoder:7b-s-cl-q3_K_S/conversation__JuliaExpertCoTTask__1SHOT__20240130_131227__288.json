The `filter` function takes a predicate and an iterable as input, creates a new iterable where each element is from the original iterable for which the predicate evaluates to `true`. Here's how you might implement `keep_only_names`:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filter!(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\nThis function works by using `filter!` instead of `filter`. `filter!` operates in-place, meaning that it modifies the original list directly. It's important to note that this implementation assumes that all words in the input list are strings and uses the fact that Julia is a case sensitive language to determine if the first character is uppercase or not.","status":200,"tokens":[0,182],"elapsed":1.46422026,"_type":"aimessage"}]
