If the first character of a `word` is not uppercase (which would mean that it's lowercase and longer than one letter), we ignore this word. Otherwise, we add it to our `new_list`. Finally, we return the `new_list`.\n\nYou can call this function as follows: \n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"elephant\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words) # This will output [\"Dog\", \"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Cat\", \"Elephant\", \"Elephant\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,298],"elapsed":2.33233316,"_type":"aimessage"}]
