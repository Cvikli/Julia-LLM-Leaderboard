Here is how you would write the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filter(word -> startswith(word, uppercase(word[1])), words)\nend\n```\nThis function filters out the words that do not start with a capital letter. The `startswith` function checks if a string starts with another string. Since we need to check if a word starts with a capital letter, we convert the first character of the word into uppercase using the `uppercase` function and then compare it with the original first character. \n\nYou can use this function like this:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"dog\", \"Eagle\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words) # prints: Dogs, Cats, Eagles.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,224],"elapsed":1.750485459,"_type":"aimessage"}]
