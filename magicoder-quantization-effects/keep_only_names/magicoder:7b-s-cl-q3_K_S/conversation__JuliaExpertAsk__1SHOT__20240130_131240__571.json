If the first character of a word (as determined using the `getindex` function on the string, which returns the Unicode code point) is an uppercase letter (`isuppercase(word[1])`), and the word itself is not empty (`!isempty(word)`), then it's pushed into the result array.\n\nNote: This function assumes that words are strings with a single character. If you have words with multiple characters that should also be handled, this function would need to be modified accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,198],"elapsed":1.564981268,"_type":"aimessage"}]
