If the first character is a capital letter (checked with `uppercase(word[1])`), we add it to `new_list`. Note that in Julia, indexing starts from 1, so we use `length(word) > 0` to avoid an error if there's an empty string or whitespace at the beginning of our word list. After all words are checked, we return `new_list`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,188],"elapsed":1.497906997,"_type":"aimessage"}]
