[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia language, we can solve this problem by using the built-in function `startswith` and list comprehension. Here is a solution that meets your instructions:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Array{String})\n    # Filter words to only those that start with an uppercase letter\n    return [word for word in words if startswith(uppercase(word), word[1])]\nend\n\n# Testing the function\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"dog\", \"cat\"]\nprint(keep_only_names(words))\n```\n\nThis program will print `[\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]` as it is filtering out the words that do not start with a capital letter.\n\nThe function `startswith` checks if the first character of a string matches the argument. We convert each word to uppercase before checking this to ensure the comparison works correctly even for mixed-case words.\n\nIn list comprehension, we create a new array which includes only those items that satisfy the condition in the `for` loop (`word in words if startswith(uppercase(word), word[1])`).\n\nFinally, the function is tested with an example input.","status":200,"tokens":[0,264],"elapsed":2.169620858,"_type":"aimessage"}]
