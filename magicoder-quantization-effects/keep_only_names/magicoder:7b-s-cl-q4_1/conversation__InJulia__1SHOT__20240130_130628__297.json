Here is how you could write this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    new_words = []\n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(word[1])\n            push!(new_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return new_words\nend\n```\nThis function `keep_only_names` goes through each word in the list `words`. The built-in Julia function `isuppercase` checks whether a character is upper case. If a word starts with an uppercase letter (checked by `word[1]`), it's added to `new_words`, which is returned at the end of the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,157],"elapsed":1.251266032,"_type":"aimessage"}]
