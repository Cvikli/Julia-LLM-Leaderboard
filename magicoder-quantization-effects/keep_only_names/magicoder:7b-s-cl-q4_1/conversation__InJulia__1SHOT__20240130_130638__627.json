If the returned value by the anonymous function is true (i.e., the first character of word `w` is an uppercase letter), that word is kept in the result. Otherwise, it's removed.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"fish\", \"apple\", \"Bird\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))  # prints [\"Dog\", \"Bird\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,190],"elapsed":1.512131428,"_type":"aimessage"}]
