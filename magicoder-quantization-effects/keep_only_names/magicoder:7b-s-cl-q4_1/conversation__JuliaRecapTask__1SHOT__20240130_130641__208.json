[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is one possible solution for your problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # filter function that checks if a word starts with an uppercase letter or not\n    # x -> (startswith(x, u\"^[A-Z]\"))\n    filter!(x->startswith(x, u\"^[A-Z]\"), words)\nend\n```\n\nIn this code:\n1. We define a function `keep_only_names` that takes a list of strings as input (`words`).\n2. Inside the function, we use Julia's built-in `filter!` function to filter out any word in the `words` list that does not start with an uppercase letter (`startswith(x, u\"^[A-Z]\")`).\n3. The `filter!` function modifies the input list in place and returns nothing. That's why we use it with `!`.","status":200,"tokens":[368,210],"elapsed":1.782897205,"_type":"aimessage"}]
