Here is a simple solution for your problem in Julia programming language.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter((word)->startswith(word, uppercase(first(word))), words)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `filter` method to iterate over each word and checks if it starts with a capital letter using `startswith` and `uppercase`. The `first` function is used to get only the first character of the string.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Doggy\", \"Cat\", \"dog\"]\nprint(keep_only_names(words)) # prints: [\"Dog\", \"Doggy\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,165],"elapsed":1.32598672,"_type":"aimessage"}]
