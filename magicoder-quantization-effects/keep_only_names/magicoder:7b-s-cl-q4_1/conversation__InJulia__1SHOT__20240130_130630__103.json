If it does, the word is added to the `filtered_words` array. It then returns this array which contains only words that start with an uppercase letter.\n\nThe helper function `isuppercasefirst(char::Char)` checks whether a character is uppercase by checking if it's either an ASCII uppercase letter (`A` to `Z`), or a Greek letter (in the range from `Α` to `Ω`).","status":200,"tokens":[0,275],"elapsed":2.213198672,"_type":"aimessage"}]
