If it is, then this word is appended to the `filtered_words` array which is returned at the end. \n\nLet's test this function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"mouse\", \"house\", \"tree\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words)) # returns [\"Dog\", \"House\", \"Tree\"]\n```\nIn the above example, all words that start with a capital letter are printed. The words starting with lowercase letters like \"cat\" or \"dog\" are ignored.","status":200,"tokens":[0,226],"elapsed":1.801547384,"_type":"aimessage"}]
