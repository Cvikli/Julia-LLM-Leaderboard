The function then checks if it's an uppercase letter and adds it to the new list if so. The result is returned as the final list with only words that start with a capital letter. \n\nYou can test the function using something like:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\", \"doggy\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words)) # Will print: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,199],"elapsed":1.614111051,"_type":"aimessage"}]
