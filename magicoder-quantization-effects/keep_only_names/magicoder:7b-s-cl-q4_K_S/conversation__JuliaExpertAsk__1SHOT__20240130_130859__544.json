The `[word for word in words if condition]` syntax creates a new array that contains only elements for which the condition holds true. In our case, it adds all words to the `filtered_words` array that start with an uppercase letter.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n```julia\nwords = [\"cat\", \"Dog\", \"car\", \"Cat\", \"dog\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))  # This will print [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"dog\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,213],"elapsed":1.637500417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
