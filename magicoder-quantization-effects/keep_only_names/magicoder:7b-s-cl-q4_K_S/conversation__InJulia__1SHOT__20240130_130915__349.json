Here's how you could do it:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(x -> startswith(x, u\"^[A-Z]\"), words)\nend\n```\n\nThe `filter` function goes through each element of the input list (`words`), checks if it fulfills the condition (in this case, if the string starts with an uppercase letter), and includes only those that do. The resulting list is then returned by the function. \n\nThis function uses Unicode character properties to check for uppercase letters. This function will work correctly even when words are in other scripts like Greek or Cyrillic which can have characters starting with an uppercase but not always as the first character of a word (like Αρθρ vs Αρθρος).\n\nPlease note that if you only want to check for English letters (not considering different alphabets or accents), you might need to use other methods. For instance, you can create a list of uppercase English letters and then check each word against this list:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(x -> startswith(lowercase(x), \"a\") && x[1] != x[2], words)\nend\n``` \n\nIn this case, `startswith` will only check if the word starts with an 'a' and the condition inside the `filter` function will ensure that the first two characters are different.","status":200,"tokens":[0,364],"elapsed":2.792387458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
