If it's uppercase, then we push that word to our new list (`new_list`). We return this `new_list` which contains only words that start with an uppercase letter.\n\nYou can call the function like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"Dog\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))  # prints [\"Cat\", \"Dog\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,211],"elapsed":1.621791797,"_type":"aimessage"}]
