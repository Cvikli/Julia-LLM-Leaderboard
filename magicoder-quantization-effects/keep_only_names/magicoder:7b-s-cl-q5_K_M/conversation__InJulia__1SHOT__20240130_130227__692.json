This will return true for words that start with a capital letter, and false for those that do not.\n\nSo if you have a list like this:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\", \"elephant\"]\nkeep_only_names(words)\n```\nThe output will be: `[\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Elephant\"]` which are all the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,221],"elapsed":1.936429176,"_type":"aimessage"}]
