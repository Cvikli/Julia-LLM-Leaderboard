[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here is how you can create this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(w -> w[1] ≠ 'a' && w[1] ≤ 'z', words)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `filter` method to iterate over each word in `words`. The condition `w[1] ≠ 'a' && w[1] ≤ 'z'` checks if the first character of a string is not lowercase or it is an uppercase letter. If these conditions are true, that word will be included in the output (i.e., it passes the filter). If none of the words pass this condition then an empty array will be returned as the result. \n\nPlease replace `{{instructions}}` with specific instructions if necessary.","status":200,"tokens":[0,184],"elapsed":1.666101162,"_type":"aimessage"}]
