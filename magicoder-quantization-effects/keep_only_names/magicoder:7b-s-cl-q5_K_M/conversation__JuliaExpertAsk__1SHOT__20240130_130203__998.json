In this case, it checks if the first character of a word is uppercase using the `uppercase(x[1])` function.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"elephant\", \"Doggy\", \"animal\", \"cat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Outputs: [\"Cat\", \"Doggy\", \"cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,210],"elapsed":1.858043714,"_type":"aimessage"}]
