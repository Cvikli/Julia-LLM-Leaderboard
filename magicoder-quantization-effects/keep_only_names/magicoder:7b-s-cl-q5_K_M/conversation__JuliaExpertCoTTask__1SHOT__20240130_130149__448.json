The filter function takes a predicate function and an iterable and returns a new collection containing all items that satisfy the condition implemented by the given predicate function. In your case, you need to check if the first character of each word is uppercase or not.\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filter(x -> isuppercase(first(x)), words)\nend\n\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])  # Returns: [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\nThe `isuppercase` function checks if the first character of a string is upper case. It returns true if it's an uppercase letter and false otherwise. The `first(x)` function returns the first character of the string `x`. Then, we use this in the filter function to keep only words that start with an uppercase letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,221],"elapsed":1.950736189,"_type":"aimessage"}]
