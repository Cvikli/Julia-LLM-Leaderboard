It then loops over each word in the list and checks whether its first letter is an uppercase letter. If it is, then the word is added to the new list (`new_list`). At the end, the function returns this new list.\n\nWhen you run this program with the given input `[\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]`, it will print: `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`","status":200,"tokens":[0,220],"elapsed":1.939159462,"_type":"aimessage"}]
