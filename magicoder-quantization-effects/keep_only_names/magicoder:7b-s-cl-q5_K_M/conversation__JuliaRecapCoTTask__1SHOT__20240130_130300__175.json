[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is the implementation for the function `keep_only_names` in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Array{String, 1})\n    filtered = String[]\n    \n    # Iterate over each word\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the first letter is uppercase\n        if isuppercase(word[1])\n            push!(filtered, word)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return filtered\nend\n```\nIn this function, we use the `isuppercase` method to check whether the first character of a string is an uppercase letter. If it is, we add it to our resultant array `filtered`. The `push!` function is used to add elements to an Array in Julia. We return the final filtered list of words.\n\nNote: This code assumes that by \"capital letter\", you mean any uppercase letter. If your definition differs, you may need a different method for checking whether a character is a capital letter (like `isalpha` and `isspace`, or perhaps some combination of these).","status":200,"tokens":[0,243],"elapsed":2.245589322,"_type":"aimessage"}]
