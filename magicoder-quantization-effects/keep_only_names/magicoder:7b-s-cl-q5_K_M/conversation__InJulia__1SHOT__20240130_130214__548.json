For each word, it checks whether the first character of the word is equal to its uppercase version. If true, it includes that word in the new list; otherwise, it excludes it.\n\nNote: `first(word)` gets the first character of a string and `uppercase(first(word))` converts it into uppercase. Also, `==` operator checks for equality of two strings. \n\nThis function will only keep words that start with a capital letter (like \"Dog\", \"Cat\" etc.).","status":200,"tokens":[68,191],"elapsed":1.688516448,"_type":"aimessage"}]
