Here is how you can write this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `filter` function to create a new list containing only those elements of `words` which satisfy the condition specified by the anonymous function passed as an argument. The `isuppercase` function checks if the first character of a string is uppercase and the `first` function returns the first (and in this case, single) character of the string.\n\nHere's how you can test it with your example:\n\n```julia\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])\n```\n\nThis will return `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`, as these are the only words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[231,217],"elapsed":3.604514687,"_type":"aimessage"}]
