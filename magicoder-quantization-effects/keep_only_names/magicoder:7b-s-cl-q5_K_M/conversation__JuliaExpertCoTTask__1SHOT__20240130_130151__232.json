Here is a simple implementation:\n\n```python\ndef keep_only_names(words):\n    result = [word for word in words if word.startswith('C') or word.startswith('D')]\n    return result\n```\nThis function will iterate over the list `words` and checks each word to see if it starts with a capital letter ('C' or 'D'). If it does, then that word is added to the new `result` list. After all words have been checked, the function returns the new list `result`.\n\nWhen you run this function with your given data like:\n```python\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])\n```\nIt will return: \n`['Carrot']`\nbecause 'Carrot' starts with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,199],"elapsed":1.757420924,"_type":"aimessage"}]
