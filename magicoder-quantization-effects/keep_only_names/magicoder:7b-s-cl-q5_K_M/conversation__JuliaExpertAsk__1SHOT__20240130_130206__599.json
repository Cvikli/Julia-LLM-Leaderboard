The condition checks if the first character of a word is the same as its uppercased version (i.e., it's a capital letter). Words for which this condition holds are added to the new array, effectively removing all other words from it.\n\nYou can call this function with an array of strings like so:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"dog\", \"Cat\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))  # prints: [\"Dog\",\"Bird\",\"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,199],"elapsed":1.748140227,"_type":"aimessage"}]
