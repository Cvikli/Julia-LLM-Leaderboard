Here we use `isuppercase(first(x))` to check whether the first character is upper case or not. If it's true then keep the word otherwise remove.\n\nNow let's test this function using the given data:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))  # It should print: [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\nThis will return a new array with only those words that start with an uppercase letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,199],"elapsed":1.790557175,"_type":"aimessage"}]
