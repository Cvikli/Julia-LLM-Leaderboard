If the first character (indexed as 1 because indexing starts from 1 in Julia) of a word is an uppercase letter (`isuppercase`), it pushes that word to the `new_words` list. At the end, it returns this list which contains only the names starting with capital letters.\n\nHere's how you can test this function:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"doll\", \"Cat\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))\n# Output: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,248],"elapsed":2.217280338,"_type":"aimessage"}]
