Here is how you can create such function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(w -> isuppercase(first(w)), words)\nend\n```\nThis function uses the built-in `filter` function of Julia to apply a condition on each element of the array (here, each word). The condition checks whether the first character of the string (`first(w)`) is uppercase or not using the `isuppercase` function. If it's an uppercase letter, then it returns true and the word stays in the list, otherwise it gets filtered out.\n  \nYou can use this function as follows:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\"]\nfiltered_names = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_names) # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,213],"elapsed":1.9076608,"_type":"aimessage"}]
