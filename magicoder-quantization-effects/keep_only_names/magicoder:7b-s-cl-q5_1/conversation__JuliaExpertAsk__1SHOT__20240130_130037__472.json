The `word[0]` part gets the first character of each word, and `isupper()` checks if it's an uppercase letter. If it is, then the word gets added to the new list.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```python\nwords = ['dog', 'Dog', 'cat', 'Cat', 'elephant', 'Elephant']\nnew_list = keep_only_names(words)\nprint(new_list)  # Outputs: ['Dog', 'Cat', 'Elephant']\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,199],"elapsed":1.781147893,"_type":"aimessage"}]
