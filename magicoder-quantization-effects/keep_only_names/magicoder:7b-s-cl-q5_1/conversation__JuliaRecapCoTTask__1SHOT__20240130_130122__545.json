[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can write the `keep_only_names` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filtered_words = [] # initialize an empty list to store the words that start with a capital letter\n    \n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(word[1]) # check if the first character of the string is uppercase \n            push!(filtered_words, word) # add this word to our filtered_words array\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\nThis function goes through each word in the provided list and checks whether the first character of the word is an uppercase letter. If it is, then it's added to the `filtered_words` list. At the end, this list is returned.\n\nPlease note that there are no special instructions provided in the question so the function written above will solve the problem according to the standard rules of Julia programming language.","status":200,"tokens":[0,217],"elapsed":1.985479513,"_type":"aimessage"}]
