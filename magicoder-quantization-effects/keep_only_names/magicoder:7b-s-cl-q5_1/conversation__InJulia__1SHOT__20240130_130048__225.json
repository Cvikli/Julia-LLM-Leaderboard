[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, Write a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem by using a for loop to iterate through each word in `words`. The `startswith` function from Base can be used to check if the first character of a string is uppercase. If it's not, you remove that word from the list with the `delete!` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    for i in eachindex(words)\n        # Check if the first character of the string is uppercase \n        if !istitle(words[i][1])\n            delete!(words, i)\n        end\n    end\n    return words\nend\n```\n\nThis function iterates over the list in reverse order to avoid issues when removing elements from the list. If a word does not start with an uppercase letter (or is empty), it gets removed. Finally, all valid names are returned.\n\nPlease note that this function mutates its input argument `words` by using the `delete!` function which removes items from the vector directly. This can have unintended consequences if you don't want to modify your original list. A better solution would be not to mutate the input and instead create a new vector containing only the words that start with uppercase letters:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    return [word for word in words if istitle(word)]\nend\n```\nThis uses list comprehension to create a new array containing only the elements from `words` that pass the condition in the list comprehension (`istitle(word)`). This solution is safer and does not mutate any input.","status":200,"tokens":[0,360],"elapsed":3.230880166,"_type":"aimessage"}]
