If it's true, the word is included in the new array (`result`). Finally, this array is returned by the function.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln.(filtered_words)\n```\nThis will output: `[\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,189],"elapsed":1.689672413,"_type":"aimessage"}]
