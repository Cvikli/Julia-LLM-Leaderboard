[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    new_list = String[]\n    for word in words \n        if isuppercase(first(word)) # checks if first letter of the string is capitalized.\n            push!(new_list, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return new_list\nend\n```\nIn this function, we iterate over each `word` in the input list `words`. For each word, we check whether its first character is uppercase using `isuppercase(first(word))`. If it is, then we add that word to our new list. Finally, we return the new list of words. \n\nThis function assumes that by \"starts with a capital letter\" you mean that the first letter of each word should be an uppercase letter (as in \"Dog\" and not \"dog\"). If you meant something different, this code will need to be adjusted accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[368,214],"elapsed":2.044303332,"_type":"aimessage"}]
