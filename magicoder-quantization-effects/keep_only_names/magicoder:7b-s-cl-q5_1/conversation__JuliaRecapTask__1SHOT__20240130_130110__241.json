X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can define this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return [word for word in words if isupper(first(word))]\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the `words` list, and it includes only those words that start with an uppercase letter. The `isupper` function checks whether the first character of each word (`first(word)`) is an uppercase letter.\n\nNote: This will also keep words that have mixed case if they start with an uppercase letter. For example, \"DoG\" would be included in the result because it starts with \"D\". If you want to strictly check for a capitalized first character and no other capitalization after that (e.g., \"DoG\" should not be included), you can modify this function as follows:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return [word for word in words if isupper(first(word)) && all(islower, word[2:end])]\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,241],"elapsed":2.219859444,"_type":"aimessage"}]
