Here is an example solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(x -> startswith(uppercase(x), x[1]), words)\nend\n```\nThis function uses the built-in `filter` method, which applies a predicate (a boolean function) to every element of an iterable and constructs a new collection of all elements for which the predicate was true. Here, the predicate is `startswith(uppercase(x), x[1])`, which checks if the first letter of each word in upper case form is equal to its lower-cased form (which would only be the case if it's a capital).\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"Elephant\", \"Doggy\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words) # prints: [\"Cat\", \"Elephant\", \"Doggy\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,229],"elapsed":2.053110091,"_type":"aimessage"}]
