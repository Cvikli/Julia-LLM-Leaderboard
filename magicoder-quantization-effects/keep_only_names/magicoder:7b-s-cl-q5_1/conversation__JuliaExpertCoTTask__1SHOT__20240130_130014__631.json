The condition checks if the first character of the word (`first(word)`) is uppercase using `isuppercase`. If it's true, that means the word starts with a capital letter and it gets included in the result. If not, the function skips it.\n\nHere is how you can use this function to solve the given problem:\n\n```julia\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])\n```\n\nThis will return `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`. As expected, it has removed all words that did not start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,233],"elapsed":2.105932676,"_type":"aimessage"}]
