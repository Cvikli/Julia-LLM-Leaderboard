If it's not, `isuppercase` will return false. So, `filter` will only include words that satisfy this condition.\n- In `filter(w -> isuppercase(first(w)), words)`, `w` represents each word in the list.\n- `filter` returns a new filtered array by iterating over the elements of the original collection (words), applying the provided function (`isuppercase(first(w))`), and collecting only those for which the function is true.","status":200,"tokens":[0,236],"elapsed":2.119690257,"_type":"aimessage"}]
