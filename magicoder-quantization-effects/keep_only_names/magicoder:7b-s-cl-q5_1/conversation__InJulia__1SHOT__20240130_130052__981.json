If it's capitalized, it keeps it. \n\nThe `uppercase(first(x))` part makes sure that we are checking whether the first character is uppercase regardless of its position in the string.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: String[\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,202],"elapsed":1.80762309,"_type":"aimessage"}]
