[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution using Julia:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    result = String[]  # initialize an empty array of Strings\n    for word in words  # iterate over each word\n        if first(word) == uppercase(first(word)) && !isspace(first(word))  \n            # check if the first character is a capital letter and it's not a space\n            push!(result, word)  \n            # if so, add the word to our result array\n        end\n    end\n    return result  # return the final list of words that start with a capital\nend\n```\nThe function `keep_only_names` takes as input an array of Strings (`words`) and returns another array of Strings. It checks each word in the input array to see if it starts with a capital letter (by checking if the first character is equal to its uppercase version). If the word does start with a capital, then we add that word to our result array. At the end, this function returns the final list of words that satisfy these conditions.\n\nPlease replace \"{{instructions}}\" with your special instructions related to this task.","status":200,"tokens":[0,260],"elapsed":2.394883932,"_type":"aimessage"}]
