If a word starts with a capital letter (i.e., `uppercase(first(word))` returns the same character as `first(word)`), then it is appended to the `result` array. The final result, an array of words that start with a capital letter, is then returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,153],"elapsed":1.380486278,"_type":"aimessage"}]
