[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you could write this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    new_words = String[]  # array to store the output\n    for word in words  # iterate over each word\n        if islowercase(word[1]) && length(word)>0  # check if first character is a lower case letter and the word is not empty\n            continue\n        elseif !isuppercase(first(word)) && length(word)>0  \n            push!(new_words, word) # add word to new_words array\n        end\n    end\n    return new_words  # return the new list of words with only those which start with a capital letter\nend\n```\nThis function goes through each word in the provided list. It checks if the first character is a lower case letter and if so, it skips to the next iteration without adding that word to the result array. If the first character is not a lower case letter (indicating it's a capital letter), it adds the word to the new_words array. Finally, it returns the resulting array of words.","status":200,"tokens":[0,246],"elapsed":1.904020449,"_type":"aimessage"}]
