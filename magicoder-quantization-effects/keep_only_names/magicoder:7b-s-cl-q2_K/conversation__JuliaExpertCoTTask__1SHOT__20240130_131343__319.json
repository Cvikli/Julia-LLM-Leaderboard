If it does, we skip it. If it starts with an uppercase letter (which means it's a name), we push it into the `new_list`. In the end, we return this list which contains only words that start with capital letters.\n\nLet's call our function using your example data:\n```julia\nprint(keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]))\n```\nOutput: `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`","status":200,"tokens":[0,245],"elapsed":1.865119229,"_type":"aimessage"}]
