[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem by using Julia's ability to iterate over collections like arrays and tuples. Here is one way you could implement the `keep_only_names` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    new_words = String[] # Initialize an empty array of strings\n    for word in words \n        if first(word)' isupper()'\n            push!(new_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return new_words\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each `word` in the provided list. If a word starts with a capital letter (`first(word)` returns the first character of the word, which will be uppercase if and only if that's how the word starts), it adds it to the new_words array.\nAfter checking all words, it returns the array of words that pass this condition.","status":200,"tokens":[0,196],"elapsed":1.51453832,"_type":"aimessage"}]
