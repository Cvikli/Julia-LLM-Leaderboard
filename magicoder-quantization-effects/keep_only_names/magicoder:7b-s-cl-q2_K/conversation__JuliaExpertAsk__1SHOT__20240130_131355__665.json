If a word starts with an uppercase letter (which we check by checking if the first character of the string is uppercase), it gets added to `new_list`. In the end, `new_list` will contain only the words from the original list that start with a capital letter.\n\nThe function then returns `new_list`. Note that you need to import `isuppercase` and `push!` functions from Base package for this code to work.","status":200,"tokens":[0,194],"elapsed":1.464728922,"_type":"aimessage"}]
