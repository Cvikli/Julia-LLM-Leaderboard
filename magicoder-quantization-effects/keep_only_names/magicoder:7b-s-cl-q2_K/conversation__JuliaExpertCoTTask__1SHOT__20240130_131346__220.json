If that word's first character is a capital letter (`uppercase(word[1])`), it is added to the `new_list`. Finally, the `new_list` containing only words with capitalized first letters is returned. \n\nLet's test this function using your data:\n```julia\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])\n```\nOutput: `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`","status":200,"tokens":[0,205],"elapsed":1.561144651,"_type":"aimessage"}]
