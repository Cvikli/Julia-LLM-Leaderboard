In this code, we use the function `uppercase(first(word))` to check if it's a capital letter and `==` to compare them. The rest is straightforward: we loop over each word, add those which start with a capital letter to the new array and return that at the end.","status":200,"tokens":[0,227],"elapsed":1.715864969,"_type":"aimessage"}]
