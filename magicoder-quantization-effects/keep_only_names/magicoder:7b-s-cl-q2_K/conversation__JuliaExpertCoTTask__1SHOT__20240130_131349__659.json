Here's the function `keep_only_names`:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return [word for word in words if islowercase(first(word)) || (isdigit(first(word)) && length(word) == 1)]\nend\n```\nIn this function, we iterate over each `word` of the provided list. If the first character is not a lowercase letter (`islowercase(first(word))` returns `false`) or if it's a number and has only one digit (length of the word is 1), we keep the word in our new list. We use the built-in function `startswith` to check if a string starts with a specified character, and `first` extracts the first character from a string. If it doesn't start with a lowercase letter or number, it's removed from the resulting array.","status":200,"tokens":[0,210],"elapsed":1.595952194,"_type":"aimessage"}]
