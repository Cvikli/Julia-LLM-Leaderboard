If a word starts with an upper case letter and has more than zero characters (so it's not an empty string), then it is added to the `result` array. Finally, the `result` array containing only words starting with a capital letter is returned.\n\nLet's test this function:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\", \"apple\"]\nprint(keep_only_names(words))\n```\nThe output of the above program will be `[\"Dog\", \"Dog\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,224],"elapsed":1.684875168,"_type":"aimessage"}]
