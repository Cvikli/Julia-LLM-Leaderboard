This function iterates over the input list of words. If a word starts with an uppercase letter (checked using the built-in function `isupper` and indexing into the string), it is added to the new_list. Finally, the function returns the new_list containing only those words which start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[231,155],"elapsed":2.389999981,"_type":"aimessage"}]
