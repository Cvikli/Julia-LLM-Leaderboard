The `startswith` method checks if the current word starts with an uppercase letter. If it does, the word is kept in the resulting array. Here's how you could do this:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    result = []\n    for word in words\n        if first(word) == uppercase(first(word)) \n            push!(result, word)\n        end \n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\nIn this code snippet:\n- The function `keep_only_names` takes an array of words (`words`) as input.\n- It iterates over each word in the input array using a for loop.\n- Inside the loop, it checks if the first character of the current word is uppercase (using the `first(word)` and `uppercase(first(word))` functions). If this condition holds true, it adds the word to another list (`result`).\n- Once all words have been processed, it returns the result array. This contains only those words that started with an uppercase letter.","status":200,"tokens":[68,256],"elapsed":1.964854734,"_type":"aimessage"}]
