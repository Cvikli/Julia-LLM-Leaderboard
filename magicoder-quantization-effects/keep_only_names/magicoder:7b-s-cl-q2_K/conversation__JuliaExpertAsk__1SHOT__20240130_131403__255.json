It is assumed that you have a function like this already in your program. If not, you can define it as follows: \n```julia\nfunction isuppercasefirst(s)\n    return typeof(s) <: AbstractString && s[1] == uppercase(s[1])\nend\n```\nYou would then call `keep_only_names([ \"cat\", \"dog\", \"Cat\" ])` and get `[ \"Cat\" ]` as the output.","status":200,"tokens":[0,255],"elapsed":1.927480422,"_type":"aimessage"}]
