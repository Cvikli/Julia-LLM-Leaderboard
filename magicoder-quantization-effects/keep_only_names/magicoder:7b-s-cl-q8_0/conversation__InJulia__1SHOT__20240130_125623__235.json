The `isuppercase` function returns true if the first character (which we get by calling `first(x)`) of a string `x` is an uppercase letter. \n\nThis function then filters out all words that do not start with an uppercase letter, leaving only those which do.","status":200,"tokens":[0,150],"elapsed":1.665162097,"_type":"aimessage"}]
