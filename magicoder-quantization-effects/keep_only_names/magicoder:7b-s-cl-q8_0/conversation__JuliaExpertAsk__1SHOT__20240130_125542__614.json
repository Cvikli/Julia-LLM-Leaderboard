In this case, we use an anonymous function (which defines a function on-the-fly) to filter out words that don't start with a capital letter using the `isuppercase` function and `first` function to get first character of the string. \n\nHere is how you can call it:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\"]\nprint(keep_only_names(words)) # This will print [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[98,195],"elapsed":2.228942047,"_type":"aimessage"}]
