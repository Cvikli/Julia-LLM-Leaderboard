The `isupper` function is used to check if the first character of the word (at index 1 because indexing starts at 1 in Julia) is uppercase. If it is, we push that word into a new list (`new_words`). At the end, we return this new list, which contains only words that start with an uppercase letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,205],"elapsed":2.284379584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
