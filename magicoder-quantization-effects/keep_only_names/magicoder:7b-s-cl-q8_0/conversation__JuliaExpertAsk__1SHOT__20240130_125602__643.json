The `isuppercase` function checks if the first character of a string (which is what `first(word)` gets us) is an uppercase letter. If it is, then the word is kept in the resulting list. Otherwise, it's removed.\n\nHere is how you can use this function:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"dog\", \"cat\"]\nprint(keep_only_names(words)) # Output: String[\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,181],"elapsed":2.018910037,"_type":"aimessage"}]
