[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is one possible implementation for `keep_only_names` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Initialize empty list to store the words that start with a capital letter\n    new_words = []\n    \n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(word[1])\n            push!(new_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return new_words\nend\n```\nIn this function, we iterate over each word in the `words` list. If a word starts with a capital letter (checked using the `isuppercase(word[1])` function), it is added to the `new_words` list. Finally, the function returns the list of words that start with a capital letter.\n\nPlease replace {{instructions}} with your specific instructions if any.","status":200,"tokens":[0,189],"elapsed":2.142020972,"_type":"aimessage"}]
