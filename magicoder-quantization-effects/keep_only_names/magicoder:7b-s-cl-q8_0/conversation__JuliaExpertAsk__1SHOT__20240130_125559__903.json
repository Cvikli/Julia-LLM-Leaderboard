The `first` function returns the first character of a string, and `isupper` checks if it's uppercase. If you want to keep the word as-is (capitalized or not), just remove the `isupper`:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return [word for word in words if isupper(first(word))]\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,166],"elapsed":1.849654462,"_type":"aimessage"}]
