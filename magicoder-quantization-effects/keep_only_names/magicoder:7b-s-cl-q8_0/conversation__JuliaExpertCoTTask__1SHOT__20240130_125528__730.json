The function `first` returns the first character of a string, and `uppercase` converts a string to upper case.\n\nNow you can test this function using your provided data:\n\n```julia\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]))  # Outputs: [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\nThe output is correct, as \"Apple\" and \"Carrot\" start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,201],"elapsed":2.256174538,"_type":"aimessage"}]
