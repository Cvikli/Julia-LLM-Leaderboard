It then checks whether the first letter of the current word is an uppercase character (i.e., it starts with a capital). If so, this word gets added to the `result` list. Finally, it returns the `result` list which contains only words that start with a capital.","status":200,"tokens":[0,187],"elapsed":2.07966041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
