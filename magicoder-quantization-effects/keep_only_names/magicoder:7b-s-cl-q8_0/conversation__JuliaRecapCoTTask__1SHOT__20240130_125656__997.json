[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you could solve this problem in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    new_list = String[] # initialize an empty array of strings \n    for word in words # iterate over each word in the input list\n        if isuppercase(word[1]) # check if the first character of the word is uppercase\n            push!(new_list, word) # if it's uppercase, add the word to the new list\n        end \n    end\n    return new_list\nend\n```\nIn this function, we're going through each word in the input list and checking whether the first character of that word (which is accessed with `word[1]`) is an uppercase letter. If it is, we add that word to our new list. Finally, we return the new list. \n\nYou can call this function like so: \n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"ant\"] # your input words\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words) # prints: [\"Dog\", \"Bird\"]\n```\nThis function will return a list of the words that start with an uppercase letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,278],"elapsed":3.162927019,"_type":"aimessage"}]
