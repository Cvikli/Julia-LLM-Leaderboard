This is achieved using the `first` and `uppercase` functions in Julia.\n\nNote: Here, \"first(word)\" refers to the first letter of the word. In case you want to start checking from second letter for some words and ignore the first one completely then you can use something like this instead: \n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return [word for word in words if islowercase(word[2])]\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,204],"elapsed":2.290900452,"_type":"aimessage"}]
