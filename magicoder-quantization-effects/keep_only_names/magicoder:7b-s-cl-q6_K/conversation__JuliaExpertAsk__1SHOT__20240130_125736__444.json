If it does, that word is added to the new list that is returned by the function. \n\nNote: Here we are considering that first character of string is considered as word, if you want to consider only alphabets then use `isalpha` instead of `isupper`. \n\nUsage example:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words)) # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,191],"elapsed":1.83945049,"_type":"aimessage"}]
