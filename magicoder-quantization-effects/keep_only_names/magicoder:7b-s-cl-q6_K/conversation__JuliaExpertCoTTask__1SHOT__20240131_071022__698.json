The condition `word -> word[1] == uppercase(word[1])` checks if the first character of a word (converted to uppercase) equals the first character of the same word. If it does, the word is kept; otherwise, it's removed from the output list.","status":200,"tokens":[0,169],"elapsed":1.608587318,"_type":"aimessage"}]
