The `filter` function applies a condition (the anonymous function `x -> x[1] == uppercase(x[1])`) to each element of the collection. If the condition is true, the element is kept; otherwise, it's discarded.\n\nIn this case, the condition checks whether the first character of each word (`x[1]`) matches its uppercase version (`uppercase(x[1])`). This will only be true for words that start with a capital letter (since `uppercase` returns the same string but all lowercase characters are converted to uppercase).","status":200,"tokens":[0,205],"elapsed":1.947701584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
