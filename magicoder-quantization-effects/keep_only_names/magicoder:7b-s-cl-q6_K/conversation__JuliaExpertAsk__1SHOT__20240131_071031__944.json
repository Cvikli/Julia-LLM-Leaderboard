The anonymous function checks if the first character of a word is equal to its uppercase version (which means it's a capital letter). If so, that word is kept; otherwise, it is removed from the final result.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words) # Outputs: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,193],"elapsed":1.832762734,"_type":"aimessage"}]
