In this case, it filters out words that do not start with a capital letter by checking if the first character of the word (`x[1]`) matches its uppercase version (`uppercase(x[1])`).\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Outputs: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,228],"elapsed":2.159545359,"_type":"aimessage"}]
