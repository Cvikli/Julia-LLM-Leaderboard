The `x -> x[1] >= 'A' && x[1] <= 'Z'` is a lambda function that checks if the first character of a string `x` is a capital letter (ASCII value of A to Z). If it is, the filter function will keep this word, otherwise it gets removed from the resulting list.\n\nThis solution assumes that words are represented as strings and that there are no empty elements in the input array.","status":200,"tokens":[0,201],"elapsed":1.947473524,"_type":"aimessage"}]
