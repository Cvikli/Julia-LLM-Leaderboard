The function `isuppercase(first(word))` checks if the first character of a string (`first(word)`) is an uppercase letter. If it is, then that string (word) is included in the result.\n\nHere's how you could use this function:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"DOG\", \"cat\", \"Dog\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln.(filtered_words)  # Prints [\"Cat\", \"DOG\", \"Dog\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,193],"elapsed":1.870655504,"_type":"aimessage"}]
