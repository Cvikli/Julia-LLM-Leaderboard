[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words) \n    filter(w -> w[1] == uppercase(w[1]), words)\nend\n\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"elephant\", \"Dog\", \"ElePHANT\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))  # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"ElePHANT\"]\n```\n\nThis function `keep_only_names` uses the built-in `filter` function to iterate over each word in the provided list and check if it starts with a capital letter. The condition `w[1] == uppercase(w[1])` checks whether the first character of a string is the same as its uppercased version, which will only be true for words that start with a capital letter (since all other characters are lowercase). If the word satisfies this condition, it is kept in the output.\n\nIf you want to use any special instructions, please specify them below:","status":200,"tokens":[11,231],"elapsed":2.316240945,"_type":"aimessage"}]
