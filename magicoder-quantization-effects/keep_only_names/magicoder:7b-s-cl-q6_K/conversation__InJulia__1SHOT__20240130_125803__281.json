The `uppercase` function is used to ensure that the first character of each word is in upper case regardless of its original casing.\n\nHere, we use `first(word)` which returns the first character of `word` and `uppercase(first(word))` checks if the first character is in uppercase or not by comparing it with itself after converting to uppercase. If they match then the word will be kept else removed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,200],"elapsed":1.906181888,"_type":"aimessage"}]
