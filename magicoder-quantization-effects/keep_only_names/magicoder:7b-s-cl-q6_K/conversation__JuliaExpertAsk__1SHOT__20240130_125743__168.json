The condition checks if a word starts with a capital letter. If it does, it is kept; otherwise, it is discarded. \n\nNote: This solution assumes that you're using Julia version 1.0 or later where the built-in `startswith` function supports Unicode characters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,148],"elapsed":1.436721614,"_type":"aimessage"}]
