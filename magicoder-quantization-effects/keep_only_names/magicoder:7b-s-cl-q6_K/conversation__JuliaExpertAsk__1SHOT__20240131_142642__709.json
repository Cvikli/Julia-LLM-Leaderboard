In this case, we are using it to filter out words that do not start with a capital letter by checking if `word[1]` equals to uppercase(`word[1]`).\n\nYou can use the function like this:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"bird\", \"Dog\", \"elephant\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Outputs: [\"Cat\", \"Dog\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,213],"elapsed":2.034176699,"_type":"aimessage"}]
