If a word starts with an uppercase letter (`startswith(word, uppercase(word[1]))`), and is not an empty string (`!isempty(word)`), it gets pushed into the new array `filtered_words`, which will be returned at the end. This array contains only those words that start with an uppercase letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,186],"elapsed":1.804164473,"_type":"aimessage"}]
