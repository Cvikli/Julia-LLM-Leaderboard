[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

This will hold the words that pass our condition (i.e., start with a capital letter).\n- We use a for loop to iterate over each word in the `words` list. \n- Inside the loop, we check if the first character of the current word is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function. This will return true if the first character is an uppercase letter and false otherwise. \n- If the condition is met (i.e., the word starts with a capital letter), we push that word to our result array.\n- Finally, we return the `result` array which contains only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,251],"elapsed":2.412505445,"_type":"aimessage"}]
