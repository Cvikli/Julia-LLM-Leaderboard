Here is the function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    result = [word for word in words if first(word) == uppercase(first(word))]\nend\n```\nThis function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each word in the input list and checks whether the first character of each word is a capital letter (which it is if it matches with its uppercase version). If so, that word gets added to the result. The `uppercase` function ensures we are checking for an uppercase letter, regardless of whether it was originally lowercase or not.","status":200,"tokens":[0,135],"elapsed":1.305447594,"_type":"aimessage"}]
