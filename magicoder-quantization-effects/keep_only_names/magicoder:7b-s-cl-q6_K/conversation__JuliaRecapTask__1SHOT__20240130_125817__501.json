[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here's how you might solve this task in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filter!(x -> isuppercase(first(x)), words)\nend\n```\nIn this function, the `filter` function applies a condition to every element of an iterable. In our case, we're filtering out any elements for which the first character in the string (`first(x)`) is not uppercase. This is what `isuppercase(first(x))` accomplishes. The filtered words are then stored back into the original array using the `!` operator, which modifies an object in-place instead of creating a new one.\n\nYou can test it with:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\"]\nkeep_only_names(words)\n```\nThis should return:\n```julia\n3-element Array{String,1}:\n \"Dog\"\n \"Cat\"\n```\nAs desired.","status":200,"tokens":[0,225],"elapsed":2.244830572,"_type":"aimessage"}]
