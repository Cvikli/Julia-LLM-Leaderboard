The `first(word)` function gives the first character of each word, and `uppercase(first(word))` converts it to uppercase. If this is the same as the original (which will be for words starting with a capital), then we keep that word.","status":200,"tokens":[0,138],"elapsed":1.324683473,"_type":"aimessage"}]
