The `startswith` function checks if a string starts with another string. In this case, we are using it to check if each word in our list starts with a capital letter. \n\nThe `uppercase(first(word))` part is used to ensure that the comparison is not case sensitive, meaning that \"Dog\" and \"dog\" would both be considered valid starting characters for a word. \n\nFinally, we use the `filter!` function to filter out any words from our list of words that do not start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,199],"elapsed":1.932011272,"_type":"aimessage"}]
