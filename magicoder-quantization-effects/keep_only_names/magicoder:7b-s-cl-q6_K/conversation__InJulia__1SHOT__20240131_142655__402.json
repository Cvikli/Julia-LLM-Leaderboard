The condition checks if the first character of each word is the same as its capitalized version. This effectively filters out any word which does not start with a capital letter. \n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"bird\", \"Elephant\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words) # prints: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,177],"elapsed":1.683639574,"_type":"aimessage"}]
