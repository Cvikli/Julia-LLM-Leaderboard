If the first character of a word (accessed by `word[1]`) is an uppercase letter (`isuppercase(word[1])`), it adds that word to the `result` array. Finally, it returns the `result` array which contains only the words starting with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,152],"elapsed":1.432599006,"_type":"aimessage"}]
