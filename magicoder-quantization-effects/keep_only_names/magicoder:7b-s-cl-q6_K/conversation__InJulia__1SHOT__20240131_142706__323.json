The `uppercase` function is used to ensure that we are checking against an uppercase version of the letter, regardless of whether it originally was in lowercase or not.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"cat\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words)) # Outputs: [\"Cat\", \"Dog\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,192],"elapsed":1.827943335,"_type":"aimessage"}]
