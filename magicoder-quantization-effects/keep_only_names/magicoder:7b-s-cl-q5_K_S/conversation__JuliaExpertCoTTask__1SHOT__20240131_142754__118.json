The `filter` function is used to iterate over each word in the list and keeps only those words that start with an uppercase letter (`x[1] == uppercase(x[1])`). This means it removes any word that does not start with a capital letter.\n\nWhen you run this code with the provided example, the output will be `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[231,184],"elapsed":6.55772986,"_type":"aimessage"}]
