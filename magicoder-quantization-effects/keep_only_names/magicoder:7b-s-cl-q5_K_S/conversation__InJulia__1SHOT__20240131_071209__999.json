The `uppercase` function is used to convert the first character of each word to its uppercase equivalent, and then checks if it is equal to itself (i.e., whether the first character was already an uppercase letter). If so, that word is kept; otherwise, it's removed from the output list.","status":200,"tokens":[0,141],"elapsed":1.17689151,"_type":"aimessage"}]
