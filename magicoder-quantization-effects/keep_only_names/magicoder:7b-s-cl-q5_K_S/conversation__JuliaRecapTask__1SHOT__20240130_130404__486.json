[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is one way to solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    newlist = [] # create an empty list for the new filtered names\n    for word in words # iterate over each word in the provided list\n        if 'A' <= word[1] && word[1] <= 'Z' # check if the first letter of the current word is a capital \n            push!(newlist, word) # if so, add it to the new list\n        end\n    end\n    return newlist # return the final filtered list\nend\n```\nThis function uses a for loop to iterate over each word in the input list `words`. It checks whether the first character of each word is a capital letter by comparing its ASCII value with that of 'A' and 'Z'. If it is, the word is added to the new list. After iterating over all words, the function returns the new list.\n  \nRemember to use the `push!` function to add elements to your list because using assignment will not change the size of the list in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[0,240],"elapsed":2.097227518,"_type":"aimessage"}]
