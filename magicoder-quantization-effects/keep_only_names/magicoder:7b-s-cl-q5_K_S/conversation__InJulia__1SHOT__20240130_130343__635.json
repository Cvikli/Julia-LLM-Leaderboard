The filtered results are then returned. \n\nTo use this function with some sample data:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"Catman\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln.(filtered_words)\n```\n\nIn the above code, `println.(filtered_words)` will print each word in the list after the operation has been performed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,197],"elapsed":1.690771939,"_type":"aimessage"}]
