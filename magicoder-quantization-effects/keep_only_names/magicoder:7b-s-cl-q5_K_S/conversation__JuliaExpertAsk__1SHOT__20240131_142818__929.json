The `filter` function applies a condition (in this case, checking if the first character of a word is capitalized) and keeps only those words that satisfy this condition. Here, `first(x)` returns the first character of a string `x`, and `uppercase(first(x))` converts the first character to uppercase.\n\nYou can use it like this:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\"]\nprint(keep_only_names(words))  # Outputs: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,195],"elapsed":1.645397254,"_type":"aimessage"}]
