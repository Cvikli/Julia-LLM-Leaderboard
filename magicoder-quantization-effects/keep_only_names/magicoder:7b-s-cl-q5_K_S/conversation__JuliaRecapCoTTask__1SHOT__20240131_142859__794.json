[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can solve this problem using a combination of list comprehension and the `startswith` function. Here's how:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return [word for word in words if startswith(word, uppercase(word[1]))]\nend\n```\nThe `startswith` function checks whether a string starts with the provided substring. The `uppercase` function is used to convert the first character of each word to uppercase. This way, we only keep the words that start with an uppercase letter (and thus are likely proper nouns).\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\", \"house\", \"House\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # prints: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"House\"]\n```\n\nThis function will iterate over each word in the input list and add it to a new list if it starts with an uppercase letter. The resulting list is then returned by the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,251],"elapsed":2.170859419,"_type":"aimessage"}]
