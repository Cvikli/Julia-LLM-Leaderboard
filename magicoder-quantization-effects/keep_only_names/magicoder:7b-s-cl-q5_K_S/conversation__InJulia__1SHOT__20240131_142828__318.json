For each word, it checks whether the first character (at index 0) is uppercase using the `isupper` function. If the first character is an uppercase letter, then the word is added to the `filtered_words` array using the `push!` function. Finally, the function returns the filtered list of words.","status":200,"tokens":[0,161],"elapsed":1.3525976,"_type":"aimessage"}]
