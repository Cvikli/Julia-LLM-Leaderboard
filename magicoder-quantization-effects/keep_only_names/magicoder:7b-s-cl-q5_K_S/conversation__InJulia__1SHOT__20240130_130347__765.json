The `filter` function checks each element in the iterable and keeps it if the condition (in this case, whether the first character is uppercase) is true. Here, we use `x -> x[1] == uppercase(x[1])` as the condition to check whether a word starts with an uppercase letter or not.\n\nTo use this function, you can pass your list of words as follows:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)\n```\nThis will print `[\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]` since the function only keeps words that start with an uppercase letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,247],"elapsed":2.104651913,"_type":"aimessage"}]
