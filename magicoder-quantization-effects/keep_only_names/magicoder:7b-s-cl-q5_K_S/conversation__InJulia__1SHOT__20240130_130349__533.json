If it is, it adds that word to the `result` array. \n\nYou can call this function with an array of words as follows:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\"]\nnew_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprint(new_words)\n```\nThis will print `[\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,184],"elapsed":1.568221142,"_type":"aimessage"}]
