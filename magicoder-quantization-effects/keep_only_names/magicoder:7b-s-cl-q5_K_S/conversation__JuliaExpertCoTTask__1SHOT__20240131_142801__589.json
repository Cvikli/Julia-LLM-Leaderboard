The `isupper(word[1])` part checks if the first character of each word is uppercase, which means it starts with a capital letter. If this condition is true for a word, that word gets added to the new list.\n\nWhen you run this code with the provided input, it will print: `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`, as these are the only words in the array that start with an uppercase letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,185],"elapsed":1.572268865,"_type":"aimessage"}]
