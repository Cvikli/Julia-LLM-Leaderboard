It checks if the first character of the current word is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function. If it's true (which means that the word starts with an uppercase letter), it adds the word to the result array using the `push!` function. Finally, it returns the result array.\n\nHere is how you can use this function:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nprint(keep_only_names(words))  # Output: [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,207],"elapsed":1.755038443,"_type":"aimessage"}]
