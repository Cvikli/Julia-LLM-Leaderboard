It does this by iterating over each word in the input list, checking if the first character is uppercase using `isuppercase(word[1])`, and if it is, adding it to the new list. Finally, it returns the new list.\n\nWhen run with the provided input, the program prints: [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"].","status":200,"tokens":[0,197],"elapsed":1.672685158,"_type":"aimessage"}]
