The `uppercase` function is used to ensure that we only keep words starting with a capital letter, as it converts all letters in a string to their uppercase equivalent. If the first character of a word matches its uppercase version (`x[1] == uppercase(x[1])`), then the word is kept; otherwise, it's removed from the list.","status":200,"tokens":[0,146],"elapsed":1.223045335,"_type":"aimessage"}]
