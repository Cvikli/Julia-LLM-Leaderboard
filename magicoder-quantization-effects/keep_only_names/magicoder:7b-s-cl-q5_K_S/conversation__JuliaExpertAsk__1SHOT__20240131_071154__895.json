The `filter` function returns a new collection that includes only those elements for which the predicate is true.\n\nThe `isuppercase` function checks if the first character of a string is uppercase. If it is, then the word starts with a capital letter and we keep it; otherwise, we discard it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,160],"elapsed":1.338026824,"_type":"aimessage"}]
