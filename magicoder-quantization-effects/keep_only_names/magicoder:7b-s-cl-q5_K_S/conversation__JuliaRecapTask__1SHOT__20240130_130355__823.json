[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's how you can solve this task in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    new_words = String[] # array to hold the filtered words\n    \n    for word in words \n        if isupper(word[1]) # checks if first character of a string is uppercase\n            push!(new_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return new_words\nend\n```\nThis function iterates over the given `words` array and adds any words that start with an uppercase letter to the `new_words` array. The built-in `isupper(word[1])` function checks if the first character of a string is uppercase (and thus starts with a capital). If it is, then the word is added to `new_words`. Finally, the function returns the `new_words` array.\n\nPlease note that this function uses Julia's `isupper(c)` function which checks if the character is an upper case letter.\n\nAlso, note that by convention in Julia, all function names start with a lowercase letter, and module names start with an uppercase letter to distinguish them from function names.","status":200,"tokens":[0,263],"elapsed":2.295525299,"_type":"aimessage"}]
