In this case, the predicate checks if the first character of a string is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # prints: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,184],"elapsed":1.553816172,"_type":"aimessage"}]
