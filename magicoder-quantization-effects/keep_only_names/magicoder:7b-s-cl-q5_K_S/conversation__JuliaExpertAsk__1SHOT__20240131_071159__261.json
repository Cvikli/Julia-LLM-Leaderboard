If the predicate returns true for an element, it's kept; otherwise, it's discarded.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,188],"elapsed":1.576512085,"_type":"aimessage"}]
