It keeps only those words where the first character is a capital letter. This is achieved with the condition `first(word) == uppercase(first(word))`, which checks if the lowercased version of the first character of the word equals its uppercase version, i.e., it is a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[98,148],"elapsed":1.296551735,"_type":"aimessage"}]
