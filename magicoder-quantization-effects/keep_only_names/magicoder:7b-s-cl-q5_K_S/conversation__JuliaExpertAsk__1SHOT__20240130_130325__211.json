Here's a simple solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the built-in `filter` function to create a new array that only includes the words where the condition (`isuppercase(first(word))`) is met. The `isuppercase` function checks if the first character of the string is an uppercase letter, while `first` extracts the first character from a string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,122],"elapsed":1.044774626,"_type":"aimessage"}]
