The anonymous function passed to `filter` checks each word in the list: if its first letter is the same as its capitalized version, it means that the word starts with a capital letter and the word is kept. If not, the word is removed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,126],"elapsed":1.070462442,"_type":"aimessage"}]
