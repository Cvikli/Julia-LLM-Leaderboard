The `startswith` function checks if the first character of the string matches the provided substring, so by passing `uppercase(word[1])`, we're checking if the first character of each word is uppercase (i.e., a capital letter).\n\nYou can use this function on an array of words as follows:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)\n# Output: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,236],"elapsed":4.137077797,"_type":"aimessage"}]
