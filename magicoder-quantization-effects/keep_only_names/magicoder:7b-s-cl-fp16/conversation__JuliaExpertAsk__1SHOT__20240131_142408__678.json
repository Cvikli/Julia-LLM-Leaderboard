The `isuppercase` function checks if a character is uppercase, while `first` gets the first (and only) element of a string in Julia.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"dog\", \"Cat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln.(filtered_words)  # Prints: Dog Bird Cat\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,172],"elapsed":2.965462816,"_type":"aimessage"}]
