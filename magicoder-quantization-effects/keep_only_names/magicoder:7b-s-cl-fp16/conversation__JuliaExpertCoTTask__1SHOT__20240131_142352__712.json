The function uses the built-in `filter` function to create a new array with only those elements from `words` that satisfy the condition `x -> x[1] == uppercase(x[1])`. This condition is true if and only if the first character of the string `x` is a capital letter. Finally, we call this function on an example list [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"].","status":200,"tokens":[0,195],"elapsed":3.374025782,"_type":"aimessage"}]
