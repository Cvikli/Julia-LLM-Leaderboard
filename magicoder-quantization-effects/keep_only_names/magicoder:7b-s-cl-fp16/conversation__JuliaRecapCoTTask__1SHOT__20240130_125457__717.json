[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function to solve this task in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    result = String[]\n    for word in words\n        if islowercase(first(word))  # first character of the string should be lowercase\n            continue\n        elseif !isuppercase(first(word)) && !ismatch(r'[0-9]', first(word))   # first character should be uppercase or a number.\n            push!(result, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\nThis function iterates over the list of words and checks if each word starts with an uppercase letter. If it does not, we skip adding that word to our final result (we continue). However, if the first character is a lowercase letter or contains any numbers (e.g., \"2nd\"), then we push that word into our final result.\n\nThe special instructions are added directly in the function. Here's an example:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"1st\", \"dog\", \"Cat\"]\ninstructions = \"Use only English alphabet characters (a-z or A-Z) and no numbers for names.\"\nresult = keep_only_names(words, instructions)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,287],"elapsed":5.07562129,"_type":"aimessage"}]
