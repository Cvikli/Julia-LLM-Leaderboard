[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the function `keep_only_names` written in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    result = String[]\n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(word[1])\n            push!(result, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nThis function iterates over the list of words and checks each word to see if it starts with a capital letter. If it does, it adds that word to the `result` array. The function then returns this `result` array. \n\nYou can test this function with your data like so:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))\n```\n\nThis will output `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`, as those are the only words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,206],"elapsed":3.550128662,"_type":"aimessage"}]
