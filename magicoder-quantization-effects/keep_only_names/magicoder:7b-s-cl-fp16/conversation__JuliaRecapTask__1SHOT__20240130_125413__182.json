[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is your function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    new_words = String[] # an empty array of strings to store the result\n    \n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(word[1]) # check if the first character of the word is upper case\n            push!(new_words, word) # if it is, add the word to new_words\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return new_words\nend\n```\nThis function goes through each word in `words`, checks if the first letter of that word is uppercase using the built-in `isuppercase` function (which returns true if all characters are uppercase and false otherwise), and if it is, adds it to a new array `new_words`. The result will be an array of words that start with an uppercase letter. \n\nPlease note that this code assumes your input words are strings. If the function does not work as expected, make sure you provide correct input data.","status":200,"tokens":[368,226],"elapsed":4.014841448,"_type":"aimessage"}]
