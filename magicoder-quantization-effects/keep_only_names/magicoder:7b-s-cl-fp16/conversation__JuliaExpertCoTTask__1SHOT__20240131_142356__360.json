We then check whether the first character of the `word` is equal to its uppercase version. If it is, the word is kept; otherwise, it's removed from the final list.\n\nYou can call this function with your data like so:\n```julia\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])\n```\nThis will return `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`, as these are the only words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,186],"elapsed":3.21849674,"_type":"aimessage"}]
