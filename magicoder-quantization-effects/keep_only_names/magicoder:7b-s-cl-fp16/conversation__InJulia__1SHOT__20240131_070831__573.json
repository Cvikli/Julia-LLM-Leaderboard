The `isuppercase` function checks if the first character of a string is an uppercase letter, and the `first` function gets the first character of a string. If the condition inside the `filter` function returns true for any word (i.e., the first character is uppercase), that word will be included in the output list.","status":200,"tokens":[0,150],"elapsed":2.571486009,"_type":"aimessage"}]
