The `isuppercase(first(word))` part checks if the first character of a word (which we assume to be the only character if it's capitalized) is uppercase. If it is, that word is included in the output list; otherwise, it's excluded.","status":200,"tokens":[0,126],"elapsed":2.162491124,"_type":"aimessage"}]
