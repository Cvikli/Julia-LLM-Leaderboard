The `uppercase(x[1])` part checks if the first character of a word is a capital letter (which means it starts with a capital letter). If it's not, then that word will be removed from the output.\n\nLet's test this function using your provided data:\n\n```julia\nprint(keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]))\n```\n\nThis should print `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]` as those are the only words that start with a capital letter in your input list.","status":200,"tokens":[0,197],"elapsed":3.409620533,"_type":"aimessage"}]
