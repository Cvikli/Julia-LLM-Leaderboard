The anonymous function checks whether the first character of each word (accessed using `first(word)`) is uppercase (`isuppercase`).\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"fish\", \"dog\", \"Cat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words) # Outputs: [\"Dog\", \"Bird\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,193],"elapsed":3.331419155,"_type":"aimessage"}]
