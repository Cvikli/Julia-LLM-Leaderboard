In this case, the predicate checks whether the first character of a word is uppercase.\n\nYou can use it like this:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Outputs: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,189],"elapsed":3.252151009,"_type":"aimessage"}]
