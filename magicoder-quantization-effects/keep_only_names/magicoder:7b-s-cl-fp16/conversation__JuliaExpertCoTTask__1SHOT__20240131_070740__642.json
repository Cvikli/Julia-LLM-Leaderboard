The `first(x)` function gets the first character of a string, and `uppercase(first(x))` converts it to uppercase.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Outputs: [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,214],"elapsed":3.700432499,"_type":"aimessage"}]
