The condition `if isupper(word[1])` checks whether the first character of the word is uppercase (which indicates that it starts with a capital letter). If the condition is true, the word is kept in the new list; if not, the word is discarded.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"dog\", \"Cat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Outputs: [\"Dog\", \"Bird\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,210],"elapsed":3.623436732,"_type":"aimessage"}]
