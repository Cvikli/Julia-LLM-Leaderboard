[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can implement such function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filtered_list = []\n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(word[1])  # checking whether the first character of a string is upper case or not\n            push!(filtered_list, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return filtered_list\nend\n```\nThe `isuppercase()` function checks whether the given character in the string is an uppercase letter. The `[1]` index is used to access the first character of the string.\n\nThe `filtered_list` holds all words that start with a capital letter, and this list is returned at the end. \n\nIf you want to use special instructions, please provide the instructions so I can customize the function according to those instructions.","status":200,"tokens":[0,188],"elapsed":3.33258417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
