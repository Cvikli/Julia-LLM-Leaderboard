The `isuppercase(first(word))` part checks if the first character of each word is uppercase (a capital letter). If it's not, that element gets removed from the array.\n\nYou can test this function with your data like so:\n\n```julia\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])\n```\n\nThis will return `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`, since those are the only words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,191],"elapsed":3.300591242,"_type":"aimessage"}]
