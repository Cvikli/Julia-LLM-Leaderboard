If it is, then the word is included in the final list.\nThe `for word in words` part iterates over each word in the provided list. The comprehension `[word for ...]` creates a new array that includes only those words which fulfill the condition specified (start with an uppercase letter).\nThis function returns a new array containing only those words from the original input array which meet the criteria of starting with an uppercase letter.","status":200,"tokens":[98,179],"elapsed":3.141154813,"_type":"aimessage"}]
