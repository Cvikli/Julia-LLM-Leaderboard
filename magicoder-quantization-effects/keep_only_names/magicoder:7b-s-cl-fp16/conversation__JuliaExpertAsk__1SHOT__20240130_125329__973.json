The `if` statement checks whether the first character of a word (which is at index 1) is a capital letter by comparing it with its uppercase version (`uppercase(word[1])`). If it is a capital letter, then this word is added to the new list that is returned by the function.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Ball\", \"dog\", \"Cat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Outputs: [\"Dog\",\"Ball\",\"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,217],"elapsed":3.799609411,"_type":"aimessage"}]
