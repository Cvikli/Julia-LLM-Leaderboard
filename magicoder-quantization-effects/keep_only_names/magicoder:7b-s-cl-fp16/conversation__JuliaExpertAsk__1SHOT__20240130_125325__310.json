For each word, it checks if the first character (accessed using `first`) is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function. If it is, the word is included in the result. Otherwise, it's excluded.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\", \"Bear\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln.(filtered_words) # Prints: Dog Bear\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,181],"elapsed":3.175728541,"_type":"aimessage"}]
