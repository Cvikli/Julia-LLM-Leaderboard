The result is a new list containing only those elements for which the provided function returned true.\n\nYou can call this function with a list of words as follows:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"elephant\", \"Elephant\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))  # Outputs: [\"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"Elephant\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,201],"elapsed":3.466208874,"_type":"aimessage"}]
