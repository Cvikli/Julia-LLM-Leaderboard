The `startswith` function checks if a string starts with a particular character or not. Here, it checks whether the first letter of each word is uppercase or not. If yes, then only that word will be kept in the final list.\n\nYou can call this function as follows:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))\n```\nThis should output `[\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,191],"elapsed":3.293004063,"_type":"aimessage"}]
