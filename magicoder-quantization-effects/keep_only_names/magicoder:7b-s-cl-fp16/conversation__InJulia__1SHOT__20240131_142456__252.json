The `startswith` function can be used to check if the first character of the word is uppercase (indicating it starts with a capital letter). Here's how you could implement this:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    result = []\n    for word in words \n        if isupper(word[1])\n            push!(result, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"dog\", \"cat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```\n\nThis will print `[\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]`, because only the words that start with a capital letter have been kept.","status":200,"tokens":[0,218],"elapsed":3.75556451,"_type":"aimessage"}]
