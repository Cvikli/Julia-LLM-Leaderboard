This method checks if all the characters in a word are capitalized and there is at least one character in it, so it works for words like \"Dog\" but not for \"dog\".\n\nIf you want to use Julia instead of Python, here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return [word for word in words if isuppercase(first(word))]\nend\n\n# Testing the function\nprintln(keep_only_names(['dog', 'Dog', 'cat', 'Cat', 'elephant']))  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,257],"elapsed":4.437232707,"_type":"aimessage"}]
