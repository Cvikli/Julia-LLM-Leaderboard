The function `filter` applies a predicate (a function that returns true or false) to each element in an iterable object (like a list) and constructs a new list with elements that satisfy the predicate. Below is how you could write it:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(word -> islowercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\nThis function `keep_only_names` uses the built-in function `islowercase` to check if the first character of a word (`first(word)`) is lowercase or not. If it's true, then the word will be included in the new list (constructed by filter), otherwise it won't. The result is a list with only words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,186],"elapsed":3.256525554,"_type":"aimessage"}]
