In this case, the predicate checks whether the first character of a word is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function. If it is, the word is kept; otherwise, it's removed from the result.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,204],"elapsed":3.50854158,"_type":"aimessage"}]
