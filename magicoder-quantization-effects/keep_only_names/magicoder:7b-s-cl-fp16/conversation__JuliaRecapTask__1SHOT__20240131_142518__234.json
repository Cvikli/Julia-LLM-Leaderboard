[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple Julia function to solve this problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    result = String[]\n    for word in words\n        if first(word) == uppercase(first(word)) && !isempty(word)\n            push!(result, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nThis function goes through each word in the input list `words`. If a word starts with a capital letter (as indicated by `uppercase(first(word))`), it is added to the results. The `isempty` check ensures that we don't include words that are empty or only consist of spaces, which may occur if the original data has trailing white space.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\", \"\", \"   \", \"Aardvark\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)\n```\nThis will output `[\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Aardvark\"]` because these are the only words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,260],"elapsed":4.55668485,"_type":"aimessage"}]
