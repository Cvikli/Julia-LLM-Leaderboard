Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Pandas, CategoricalArrays\n\ndf_cars = DataFrame(manufacturer=[\"audi\", \"bmw\", \"audi\", \"toyota\"], model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4 quattro\", \"corolla\"])\n\nfunction audi_filter(df::DataFrame)\n    df = df[df.manufacturer .== \"audi\" && (df.model .== \"a4\" || df.model .== \"a4 quattro\"), :]\n    df[:, :new_column] = true\n    return df\nend\n\ndf_filtered = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```\nIn the above code, we first filter our DataFrame to only include rows where `manufacturer` equals \"audi\" and `model` is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". We then create a new column named `:new_column` that is filled with `true`. This will be added to our final filtered DataFrame. The function returns the modified DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,248],"elapsed":1.910259549,"_type":"aimessage"}]
