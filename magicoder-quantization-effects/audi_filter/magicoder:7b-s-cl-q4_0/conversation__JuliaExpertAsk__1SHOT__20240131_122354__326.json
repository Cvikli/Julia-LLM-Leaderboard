Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might code this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Query\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    df = @from i in df_cars begin\n        where (:manufacturer == \"audi\" && \n               :model in [\"a4\", \"quattro\"])\n        let!(:audi_a4_type = true)\n        end\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `@from` macro from Query.jl to filter rows in `df_cars` where the manufacturer is \"audi\" and the model is either \"a4\" or \"quattro\". The `@let!` macro creates a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` for all of these rows.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use this function:\n\n```julia\n# Assuming df_cars is your DataFrame\ndf_new = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,228],"elapsed":1.71255969,"_type":"aimessage"}]
