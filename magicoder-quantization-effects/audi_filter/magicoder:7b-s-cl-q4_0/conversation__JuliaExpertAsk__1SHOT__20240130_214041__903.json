Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution using pandas:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef audi_filter(df_cars):\n    df = df_cars[(df_cars['manufacturer'] == 'audi') & (df_cars['model'].isin(['a4', 'a4 quattro']))]\n    \n    # Create a new column\n    df['audi_a4_type'] = True\n    \n    return df\n```\n\nThis function first filters the DataFrame to only include rows where `manufacturer` is \"audi\" and `model` is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". Then, it creates a new column called `audi_a4_type` that is set to `True` for all of these filtered rows. Finally, the function returns the modified DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[141,182],"elapsed":1.376154327,"_type":"aimessage"}]
