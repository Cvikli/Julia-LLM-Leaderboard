Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

The new column `audi_a4_type` is added as `true` across all the filtered rows. Then, it returns the resulting DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[111,234],"elapsed":2.66409819,"_type":"aimessage"}]
