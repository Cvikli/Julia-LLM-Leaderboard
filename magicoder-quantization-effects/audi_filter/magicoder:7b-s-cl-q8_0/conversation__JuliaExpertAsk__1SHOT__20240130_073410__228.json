Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use pandas' `.loc` function to filter the DataFrame based on your conditions, and add a new column using `.assign`. Here is how you could implement this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd \n\n# Define the function\ndef audi_filter(df_cars):\n    df_audi = df_cars.loc[(df_cars['manufacturer'] == 'Audi') & (df_cars['model'].isin(['a4','a4 quattro']))]\n    \n    # Create the new column\n    df_audi = df_audi.assign(audi_a4_type=True)\n    \n    return df_audi\n```\nThis function will return a DataFrame with only rows where `manufacturer` is 'Audi' and `model` is 'a4' or 'a4 quattro', along with an additional column named `audi_a4_type` that has been set to True for all those rows. If there are other models under 'Audi' but not 'a4' or 'a4 quattro', they will be removed in the process and this new column won't be created for them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,254],"elapsed":2.872121125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
