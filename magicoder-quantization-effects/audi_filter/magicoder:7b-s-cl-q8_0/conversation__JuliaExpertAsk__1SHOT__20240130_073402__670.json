Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    # filter data frame for Audi cars only\n    df_audi = @from i in df_cars begin\n        @where i.manufacturer == \"Audi\" && (i.model == \"a4\" || i.model == \"a4 quattro\")\n        @select { :_, :model => ByRow(() -> true) } # add new column indicating type as Audi a4 or a4 quattro\n    end |> DataFrame\n\n    return df_audi\nend\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing your data frame to it:\n\n```julia\ndf = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```\n\nThis function uses the `@from`, `@where`, and `@select` macros from DataFrames.jl to filter rows, select new columns, and add new columns respectively. The `ByRow(() -> true)` creates a new column with `true` for every row.","status":200,"tokens":[0,232],"elapsed":2.636981819,"_type":"aimessage"}]
