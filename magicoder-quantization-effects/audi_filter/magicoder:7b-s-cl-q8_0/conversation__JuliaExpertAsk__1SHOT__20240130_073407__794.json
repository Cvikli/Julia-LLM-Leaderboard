Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Python code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef audi_filter(df_cars):\n    # filter out data for 'Audi' and models 'a4 or a4 quattro'\n    df_audi = df_cars[(df_cars['manufacturer'] == 'Audi') & (df_cars['model'].isin(['a4', 'a4 quattro']))]\n    \n    # create new column with all true values\n    df_audi[\"audi_a4_type\"] = True\n    \n    return df_audi\n```\n\nThis function first filters the original DataFrame `df_cars` to only include rows where 'manufacturer' is 'Audi' and 'model' is either 'a4' or 'a4 quattro'. Then it creates a new column 'audi_a4_type' with all values set to True. Finally, it returns the modified DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,209],"elapsed":2.356758304,"_type":"aimessage"}]
