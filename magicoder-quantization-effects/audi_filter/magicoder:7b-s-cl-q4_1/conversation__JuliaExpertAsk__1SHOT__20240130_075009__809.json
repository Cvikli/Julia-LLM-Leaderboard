Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, CSV\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    df_filtered = filter(row -> row.manufacturer == \"audi\" && (row.model == \"a4\" || row.model == \"a4 quattro\"), df_cars)\n    add_column!(df_filtered, :audi_a4_type => true)\n    return df_filtered\nend\n```\n\nIn the above function:\n- We first filter `df_cars` to include only rows where `manufacturer` is \"audi\" and `model` is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". This is done using the `filter` function.\n- The `=> true` part creates a new column named `:audi_a4_type` that consists of all `true`s across rows.\n- Finally, we return the modified DataFrame `df_filtered`.","status":200,"tokens":[141,223],"elapsed":1.849397502,"_type":"aimessage"}]
