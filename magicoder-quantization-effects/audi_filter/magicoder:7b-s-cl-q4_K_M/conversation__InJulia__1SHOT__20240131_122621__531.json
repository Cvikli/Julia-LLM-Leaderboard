It then creates a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals true for all rows. Finally, it returns the resulting DataFrame.\n\nYou can call this function on your DataFrame as follows:\n```julia\ndf_cars = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,281],"elapsed":2.233103324,"_type":"aimessage"}]
