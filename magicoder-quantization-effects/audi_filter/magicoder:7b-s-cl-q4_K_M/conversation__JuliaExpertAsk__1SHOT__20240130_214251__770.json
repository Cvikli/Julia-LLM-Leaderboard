Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

The result is returned as a new DataFrame.\n\nPlease make sure you have the Query.jl package installed in your Julia environment.
