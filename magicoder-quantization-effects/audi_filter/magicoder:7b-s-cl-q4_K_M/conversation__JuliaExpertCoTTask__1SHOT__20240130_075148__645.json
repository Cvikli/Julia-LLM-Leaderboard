Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\ndf_cars = DataFrame(manufacturer=[\"audi\", \"audi\", \"bmw\", \"audi\", \"audi\", \"ford\", \"audi\", \"audi\", \"toyota\", \"audi\"],\n    model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"3 series\", \"a4 quattro\", \"q7\", \"fusion\", \"tt\", \"a4\", \"corolla\", \"a4 quattro\"])\naudi_filter(df_cars)","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution in Julia programming language:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:audi_a4_type] = (df.manufacturer .== \"audi\") .& (df.model .in [\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"])\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by creating a new column `audi_a4_type` where it checks if both the manufacturer and model of each row is \"audi\" and either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". If these conditions are true, it will set the value in that row to `true`, otherwise it will leave as default (i.e., `false`).\n\nYou can then call this function with your DataFrame like so:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(manufacturer=[\"audi\", \"audi\", \"bmw\", \"audi\", \"audi\", \"ford\", \"audi\", \"audi\", \"toyota\", \"audi\"],\n    model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"3 series\", \"a4 quattro\", \"q7\", \"fusion\", \"tt\", \"a4\", \"corolla\", \"a4 quattro\"])\ndf_cars = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```\nPlease note that this function does not check if the data types of `manufacturer` and `model` are correct. If they are not strings or if there are missing values, you will need to handle these cases as well before running the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,340],"elapsed":2.784373825,"_type":"aimessage"}]
