[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a DataFrame `df_cars` with car data with columns `manufacturer` and `model`.

Then it adds a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals true for all of these selected rows. Finally, it returns the modified DataFrame.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that your DataFrame has been properly imported and categorized as CategoricalArrays to handle string comparisons efficiently. If not, you can convert the columns to CategoricalArrays using `df[:manufacturer] = categorical(df[:manufacturer])` and `df[:model] = categorical(df[:model])`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,255],"elapsed":2.058421588,"_type":"aimessage"}]
