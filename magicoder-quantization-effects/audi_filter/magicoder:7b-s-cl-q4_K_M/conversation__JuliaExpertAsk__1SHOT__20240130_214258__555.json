Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

It then adds a new column `audi_a4_type` with value `true` for all these rows.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(manufacturer=[\"audi\", \"toyota\", \"bmw\", \"audi\", \"mercedes\"], model=[\"a4\", \"corolla\", \"x5\", \"a4 quattro\", \"c200\"])\nnew_df = audi_filter(df)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,287],"elapsed":2.258980754,"_type":"aimessage"}]
