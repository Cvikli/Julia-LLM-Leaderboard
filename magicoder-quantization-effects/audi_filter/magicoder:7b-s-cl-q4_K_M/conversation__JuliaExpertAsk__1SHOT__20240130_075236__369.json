Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python function using pandas library for this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef audi_filter(df_cars):\n    df_filtered = df_cars[df_cars['manufacturer'].str.lower().isin(['audi'])]\n    df_filtered = df_filtered[df_filtered['model'].str.lower().isin(['a4', 'quattro'])]\n    \n    df_filtered['audi_a4_type'] = True\n    return df_filtered\n```\nYou can call this function with your DataFrame as follows:\n\n```python\ndf_cars = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```\n\nThis function filters the DataFrame `df_cars` first to rows where manufacturer is \"audi\" and then it further filters these results to only include rows where model is either \"a4\" or \"quattro\". It then creates a new column `audi_a4_type` as True across all these selected rows. Finally, the function returns the resulting DataFrame.\n\nRemember that python is case-sensitive so if your data has mixed cases for \"Audi\", \"Quattro\", you might want to convert both columns to lowercase before comparing with `isin()` or `lower()`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,287],"elapsed":2.305807313,"_type":"aimessage"}]
