Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

It then creates a new column `audi_a4_type` equal to `true`. Finally, it returns the modified dataframe.","status":200,"tokens":[0,159],"elapsed":1.339294454,"_type":"aimessage"}]
