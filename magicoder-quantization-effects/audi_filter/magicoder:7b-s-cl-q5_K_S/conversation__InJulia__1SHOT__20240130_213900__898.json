Then it creates a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Finally, it returns the resulting DataFrame.\n\nNote: `@where` is a macro from the DataFramesMeta package which simplifies filtering operations on DataFrames.","status":200,"tokens":[0,214],"elapsed":1.789766809,"_type":"aimessage"}]
