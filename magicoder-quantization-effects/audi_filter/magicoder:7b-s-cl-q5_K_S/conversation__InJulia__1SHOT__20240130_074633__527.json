Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use the filter function in Julia to achieve this, here is how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    df_filtered = filter(row -> (row.manufacturer == \"audi\" && \n                                row.model in [\"a4\", \"quattro\"]), df_cars)\n    \n    df_filtered[:audi_a4_type] = true\n    \n    return df_filtered\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a DataFrame as an argument and filters it down to only include rows where the `manufacturer` is \"audi\" and the `model` is either \"a4\" or \"quattro\". It then adds a new column called `audi_a4_type`, setting all of its values to `true`. Finally, the function returns the resulting DataFrame.\n\nYou can call this function with your DataFrame as follows:\n```julia\ndf_cars = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,231],"elapsed":1.977668634,"_type":"aimessage"}]
