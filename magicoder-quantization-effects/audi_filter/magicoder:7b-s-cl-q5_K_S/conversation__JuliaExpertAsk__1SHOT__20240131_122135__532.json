Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation in Julia using DataFrames.jl package:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df::DataFrame)\n    df = filter(row -> row[:manufacturer] == \"audi\" && (row[:model] == \"a4\" || row[:model] == \"a4 quattro\"), df)\n    df[:audi_a4_type] .= true\n    return df\nend\n```\nIn this function, we first use the `filter` function to select rows where manufacturer is \"audi\" and model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". Then we add a new column named `audi_a4_type` with all values set to true. Finally, we return the updated DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[141,168],"elapsed":1.448601157,"_type":"aimessage"}]
