Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is an example of how you can accomplish this task:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Pandas\n\ndf_cars = DataFrame(manufacturer=[string(i) for i in 1:5], model=[\"a4\" \"^quattro\" \"a6\" \"r8\" \"a7\"])\n\nfunction audi_filter(df::DataFrame)\n    df2 = filter(row -> row.manufacturer == \"audi\" && (row.model == \"a4\" || row.model == \"a4 quattro\"), df)\n    df2[:, :audi_a4_type] .= true\n    return df2\nend\n\ndf_cars = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```\n\nIn this example, the function `audi_filter` filters the rows of `df_cars` where the manufacturer is \"audi\" and the model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". It then creates a new column `audi_a4_type` with all values being true. Finally, it returns the resulting DataFrame.\n\nPlease replace `\"a4\"` and `\"a4 quattro\"` in `model` column with your actual car models.","status":200,"tokens":[0,267],"elapsed":2.33433085,"_type":"aimessage"}]
