We first filter out all rows that don't have “audi” as the manufacturer and then check if the model is either \"a4\" or \"quattro\". If it passes both conditions, we set a new column called `audi_a4_type` to true.\n\n```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df::DataFrame)\n    # filter out all rows where manufacturer is not 'audi'\n    df = df[df.manufacturer .== \"audi\", :]\n    \n    # create a new column indicating whether the car is an A4 or Quattro\n    df[:,:audi_a4_type] = (df.model .== \"a4\") | (df.model .== \"quattro\")\n    \n    return df\nend\n```\nYou can call this function on your DataFrame like so:\n\n`df_cars_filtered = audi_filter(df_cars)`","status":200,"tokens":[0,225],"elapsed":1.730480338,"_type":"aimessage"}]
