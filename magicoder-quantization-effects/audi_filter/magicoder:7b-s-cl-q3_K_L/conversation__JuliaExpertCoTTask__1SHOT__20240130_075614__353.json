Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

First it uses logical indexing to select rows where `manufacturer` is \"audi\" and `model` is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". Then, it adds a new column named `audi_a4_type` with all values as true (since you want the entire row to be considered as an \"Audi A4\" type). Finally, the function returns the updated DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,262],"elapsed":2.172658591,"_type":"aimessage"}]
