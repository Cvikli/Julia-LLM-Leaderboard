Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use Pandas for this task, here is an example function:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assuming df_cars is already defined\ndef audi_filter(df_cars):\n    # Filter down to Audi A4\n    df_audi = df_cars[df_cars['manufacturer'] == 'Audi']\n    df_audi = df_audi[df_audi['model'].isin(['a4', 'a4 quattro'])].copy()\n    \n    # Add a new column indicating type of Audi car\n    df_audi['audi_a4_type'] = True\n    \n    return df_audi\n```\n\nYou can call this function with `df_cars` as follows:\n\n```python\nnew_df_cars = audi_filter(df_cars)\nprint(new_df_cars)\n```\nThis will print the new DataFrame, which only contains rows for Audi A4 and A4 Quattro. The `audi_a4_type` column will be set to True in all such rows.","status":200,"tokens":[0,246],"elapsed":1.908681256,"_type":"aimessage"}]
