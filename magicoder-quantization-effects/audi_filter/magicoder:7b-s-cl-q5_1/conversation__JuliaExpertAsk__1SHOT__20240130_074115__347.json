Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is one way to do it using the pandas library in Python:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef audi_filter(df_cars):\n    df_audi = df_cars[df_cars['manufacturer'] == 'Audi']\n    df_audi = df_audi[df_audi['model'].isin(['a4', 'a4 quattro'])]\n    \n    # create new column\n    df_audi['audi_a4_type'] = True\n    \n    return df_audi\n```\n\nHere, we first filter the DataFrame to only include rows where manufacturer is \"Audi\". Then we further filter to only include rows where model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". The `isin()` function is used for this.\n\nNext, we create a new column named 'audi_a4_type' that equals True in all rows of the resulting DataFrame and return it. \n\nRemember to call your function with your DataFrame as its argument: `df_filtered = audi_filter(df_cars)`.","status":200,"tokens":[141,242],"elapsed":2.207118849,"_type":"aimessage"}]
