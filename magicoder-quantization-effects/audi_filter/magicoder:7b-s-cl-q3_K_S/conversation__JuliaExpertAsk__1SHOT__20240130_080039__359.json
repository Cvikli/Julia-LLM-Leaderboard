Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can solve this problem:\n```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    df_cars[Symbol(\"manufacturer\")] .== \"Audi\" .|  df_cars[:model] .in([\"A4\", \"A4 Quattro\"]) .& [beginswith.(df_cars[:model], \"A4\")];\nend\n```\nThis function uses DataFrame's `==` operator to check for exact matches, `.in()` to check if a value is in a vector of values, and `.|` (bitwise OR) to combine conditions. The `[beginswith.(df_cars[:model], \"A4\")]` line uses broadcasting with the `beginswith` function from DataFramesMeta to match any model that starts with “A4”.","status":200,"tokens":[0,183],"elapsed":1.441407611,"_type":"aimessage"}]
