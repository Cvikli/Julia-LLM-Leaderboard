Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

The condition in filter checks whether the row's manufacturer is \"audi\" and its model is either \"a4\" or \"quattro\". For each of these rows, it creates a new column 'audi_a4_type' that equals true across all rows. Finally, it returns the resulting DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,252],"elapsed":4.37945359,"_type":"aimessage"}]
