Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can solve this problem in Julia using DataFrames.jl package:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df::DataFrame)\n    df = filter(r -> r.manufacturer == \"audi\" && (r.model == \"a4\" || r.model == \"a4 quattro\"), df)\n    df[:audi_a4_type] = [true for i in 1:size(df,1)]\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `filter` function from DataFrames package to filter rows of the dataframe where the manufacturer is \"audi\" and model is \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". Then it creates a new column named `audi_a4_type` with all elements set to true. Finally, it returns the updated dataframe.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(manufacturer = [\"audi\", \"bmw\", \"audi\", \"mercedes\", \"audi\"], model = [\"a4\", \"320i\", \"a4 quattro\", \"s500\", \"r8\"])\nfiltered_df = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,275],"elapsed":2.658556801,"_type":"aimessage"}]
