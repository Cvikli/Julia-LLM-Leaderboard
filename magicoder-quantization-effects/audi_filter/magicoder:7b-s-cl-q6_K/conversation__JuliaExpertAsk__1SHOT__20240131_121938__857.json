Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can write this function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    df = filter(row -> (row.manufacturer == \"audi\" && (row.model == \"a4\" || row.model == \"a4 quattro\")), df_cars)\n    df[:audi_a4_type] = true\n    return df\nend\n```\nThis function first filters the DataFrame `df_cars` to only include rows where the manufacturer is \"audi\" and the model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". It then creates a new column `audi_a4_type`, setting it equal to `true` for all rows. Finally, it returns the resulting DataFrame.\n\nYou can call this function with your DataFrame like this:\n```julia\ndf_cars = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,210],"elapsed":2.001781048,"_type":"aimessage"}]
