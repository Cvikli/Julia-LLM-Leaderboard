Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function which accomplishes this task:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Pandas # assuming you're using pandas for dataframes and filtering\n\n# Function to filter Audi A4 cars\nfunction audi_filter(df::DataFrame)\n    df = @from i in df begin \n        @where i.manufacturer == \"audi\" && (i.model == \"a4\" || i.model == \"a4 quattro\")\n        @transform(_ = true => :audi_a4_type)\n    end |> DataFrame\n    return df\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `@from` macro to filter rows in the dataframe `df`. It filters for rows where the manufacturer is \"audi\" and the model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". Then, it transforms these filtered rows by setting a new column `audi_a4_type` to true.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(manufacturer=[1,2,3,\"Audi\",5], model=[\"A6\", \"A4\", \"A8\", \"A4 quattro\", \"R8\"])\ndf_filtered = audi_filter(df)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,276],"elapsed":2.636756229,"_type":"aimessage"}]
