Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

The resulting DataFrame is returned by the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,176],"elapsed":1.536924555,"_type":"aimessage"}]
