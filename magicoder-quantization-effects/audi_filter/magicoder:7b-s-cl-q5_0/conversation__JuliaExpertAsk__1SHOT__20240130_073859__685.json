Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could accomplish this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, DataFramesMeta\n\nfunction audi_filter(df::DataFrame)\n    filter!(r -> r.manufacturer == \"audi\" && (r.model == \"a4\" || r.model == \"quattro\"), df)\n    df[:audi_a4_type] = true\n    return df\nend\n```\nThis function first filters the DataFrame to only include rows where `manufacturer` is `\"audi\"` and `model` is either `\"a4\"` or `\"quattro\"`. It then creates a new column `audi_a4_type`, which equals `true` across all rows. Finally, it returns the resulting DataFrame.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(manufacturer=[\"audi\", \"bmw\", \"toyota\", \"audi\", \"audi\"], model=[\"a4\", \"a5\", \"corolla\", \"quattro\", \"s4\"])\nnew_df = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```\nIn this example, `new_df` will be a DataFrame that only contains rows where `manufacturer` is `\"audi\"` and `model` is either `\"a4\"` or `\"quattro\"`, and it also includes an additional column `audi_a4_type` which equals `true` across all rows.","status":200,"tokens":[141,322],"elapsed":2.81013546,"_type":"aimessage"}]
