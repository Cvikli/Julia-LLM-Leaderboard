Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function named audi_filter which satisfies your requirements:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    df = filter((row) -> row.manufacturer == \"audi\" && (row.model == \"a4\" || row.model == \"a4 quattro\"), df_cars)\n    df[:audi_a4_type] .= true\n    return df\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `filter` function from DataFrames package to filter out rows with manufacturer as \"audi\" and model as \"a4 or a4 quattro\". It then creates a new column `audi_a4_type` equal to `true` across all these rows. Finally, it returns the resulting DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,170],"elapsed":1.475679452,"_type":"aimessage"}]
