All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, we can solve this problem using a dictionary-based approach where we associate each type with its corresponding boolean value indicating whether it is personal or not. Here's how you could define such function:\n\n```julia\nabstract Vehicle\n\nstruct Car <: Vehicle end  # true for personal\nstruct Motorcycle <: Vehicle end  # true for personal\nstruct Bus <: Vehicle end  # false for personal\nstruct Truck <: Vehicle end  # false for personal\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::T) where {T<:Vehicle}\n    return Dict(Car=>true, Motorcycle=>true, Bus=>false, Truck=>false)[T]\nend\n```\nThis function uses a dictionary to map each vehicle type to its corresponding trait indicating whether it is personal or not. Note that the types are passed as Type objects (`T` in this case) into the function, thus enabling the `where` clause to ensure that we're dealing with concrete subtypes of Vehicle. The function then returns the Boolean value associated with the given Type.\n\nFor example, `ispersonal(Car())` will return `true`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,263],"elapsed":2.070824881,"_type":"aimessage"}]
