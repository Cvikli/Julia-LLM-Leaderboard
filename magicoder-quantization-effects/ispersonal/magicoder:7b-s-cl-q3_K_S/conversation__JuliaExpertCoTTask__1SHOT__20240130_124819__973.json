All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

All other subtypes (e.g., Airplane) would be handled in the same manner by default, unless new methods are defined elsewhere in your code to override this behavior. \n\nIn the given example, `ispersonal(Car())` returns `True`, because a car is indeed a personal vehicle for everyday driving. Similarly, `ispersonal(Bus())` and `ispersonal(Truck())` also return `False` because buses and trucks are not generally used for daily driving.","status":200,"tokens":[0,275],"elapsed":2.159837664,"_type":"aimessage"}]
