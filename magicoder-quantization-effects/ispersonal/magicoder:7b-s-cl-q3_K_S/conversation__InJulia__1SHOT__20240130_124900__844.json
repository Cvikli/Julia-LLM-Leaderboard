Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, we can write a function `ispersonal` that checks if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving using discriminated unions (i.e., Union{T} where T <: Type). For Car and Motorcycle types it will return true because they are generally used for daily commuting. On the other hand, for Bus or Truck types it will return false as these vehicles are typically not used for daily commuting. Here is an example of how this can be implemented in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\ntypealias Car <: AbstractVehicle\ntypealias Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle\ntypealias Bus <: AbstractVehicle\ntypealias Truck <: AbstractVehicle\n\nispersonal(vehicle::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle} = T == Car || T==Motorcycle\n```\nIn the above code, `ispersonal` function returns true if the provided vehicle type is either `Car` or `Motorcycle`, otherwise it returns false. This implementation works for all subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`. \nFor example: \n\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,329],"elapsed":2.574625589,"_type":"aimessage"}]
