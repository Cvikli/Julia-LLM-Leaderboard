[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving.

Here is how we might implement the required functionality:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle <: Vehicle end  # define an abstract vehicle as supertype for all vehicles\nCar <: AbstractVehicle; Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; Bus <: AbstractVehicle; Truck <: AbstractVehicle\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}  # function to check if a vehicle type is personal for everyday driving\n    return T in (Car, Motorcycle)   # true for Car and Motorcycle only, rest are false.\nend\n```\nThis will work as expected for the types we have defined here. However, it would be good practice to make this more general by providing a list of personal vehicle types at runtime:\n\n```julia\npersonal_vehicles = [Car, Motorcycle]  # define personal vehicles\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    return T in personal_vehicles   # check if the vehicle type is in our list of personal vehicles.\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,266],"elapsed":2.153960544,"_type":"aimessage"}]
