All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can create a dictionary mapping from each type of vehicle to its personal trait, and then use the `typeof` function to find out the type of input and return the corresponding value from the dictionary. If the input type is not in the dictionary keys, it returns false. Here's how you can do that:\n\n```julia\nabstract Vehicle end  # abstract parent for all vehicles\n\nmutable struct Car <: Vehicle end  # A car is a type of vehicle.\nmutable struct Motorcycle <: Vehicle end  # A motorbike is also a vehicle.\nmutable struct Bus <: Vehicle end  # A bus is also a vehicle.\nmutable struct Truck <: Vehicle end  # And so on...\n\nfunction ispersonal(v::T) where {T<:Vehicle}\n    return Dict(Car()=>true, Motorcycle()=>true, Bus()=>false, Truck()=>false)[typeof(v)] || false\nend\n```\nIn this code, we define `ispersonal` function. Firstly it checks the type of input argument using `typeof(v)`. Then, it returns corresponding value from a dictionary. If there is no such key in the dictionary (e.g., for `Truck()`), it returns false.\n\nSo calling `ispersonal(Car())`, `ispersonal(Motorcycle())` and so on will return true, because cars and motorcycles are personal vehicles for everyday driving. And `ispersonal(Bus())` and `ispersonal(Truck()))` will return false, because buses and trucks are not used for daily commuting.","status":200,"tokens":[0,369],"elapsed":2.925515116,"_type":"aimessage"}]
