All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task we could use Julia's multiple dispatch feature where a function is defined once and works on different types at the same time. Here's how to implement it:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nabstract type PersonalVehicle <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: PersonalVehicle\nend \n\nstruct Motorcycle <: PersonalVehicle\nend \n\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle\nend \n\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle\nend \n\nfunction ispersonal(veh::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    return false\nend\n\nispersonal(veh::PersonalVehicle) = true\n\n# Example\n\njulia> Car()\nCar()\n\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n```\nThis function `ispersonal` will first check if the input vehicle type is a subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, and if not, it returns false. Then it checks if it's a subtype of `PersonalVehicle`. If yes, then true is returned. This way, Car(), Motorcycle() and any other types that inherit from PersonalVehicle return `true` while all other types will return `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,289],"elapsed":2.320255821,"_type":"aimessage"}]
