[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving.

We then define a function `ispersonal` that returns true for both Car and Motorcycle but false for Bus and Truck. The `where {T<:AbstractVehicle}` part is a type parameter that allows the function to work on any subtype of AbstractVehicle. If you want to add more subtypes, just add additional lines with `ispersonal(::NewSubtype) = true/false` depending on whether it's personal or not.\n\nYou can test this function using:\n```julia\nfor vehicle in [Car(), Motorcycle(), Bus(), Truck()]\n    @show ispersonal(vehicle)  # Outputs true for Car and Motorcycle, false otherwise.\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,347],"elapsed":2.852500174,"_type":"aimessage"}]
