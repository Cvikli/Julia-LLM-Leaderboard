All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can define a trait for each type of vehicle in Julia like this:\n\n```julia\nabstract Vehicle <: AbstractVehicle end\nabstract Car <: Vehicle end \nabstract Motorcycle <: Vehicle end\nabstract Bus <: Vehicle end\nabstract Truck <: Vehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle} = false # default trait is false\nispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true \nispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = true \n```\nIn the above code, we first define an abstract type `Vehicle` and its subtypes `Car`, `Motorcycle`, etc. Then we specify a trait for each of these types using a function named `ispersonal`. The default trait is set to be false for any other type of vehicle. \n\nYou can call the function like this:\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car)) # Outputs: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck)) # Outputs: false\nprintln(ispersonal(Bike)) # Outputs: false, because Bike is not defined\n```\nAs you can see the function defaults to returning `false` for a type that hasn't been explicitly declared as personal.","status":200,"tokens":[0,293],"elapsed":2.279521825,"_type":"aimessage"}]
