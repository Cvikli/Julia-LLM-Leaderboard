All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you might implement such a function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle\n    is_personal::Bool # True if the car can be used for personal daily activities\nend\n\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle\n    is_personal::Bool # True if the motorcycle can be used for personal daily activities\nend\n\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle} = false\nispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = true\n```\n\nThis is a simple implementation with Julia. We define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and then four specific vehicle types, each of which has a different value for the attribute `is_personal`. The function `ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}` returns false by default for any subtype of AbstractVehicle. For the Car and Motorcycle types, we provide custom implementations that return true or false respectively.\n\nFor instance,\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,322],"elapsed":2.527301958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
