We then define the function `ispersonal`, which returns true if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle (Car or Motorcycle), false otherwise for other types (Bus or Truck). The last line is a fallback definition that will return false for any other type.\nThe `@assert` statements are used to test our function with Car, Motorcycle, Bus, and Truck, as well as an unknown subtype of AbstractVehicle. They throw an error if the assertion fails, which we can ignore in this case.","status":200,"tokens":[0,354],"elapsed":3.178318985,"_type":"aimessage"}]
