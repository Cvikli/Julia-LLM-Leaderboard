All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, we can solve this problem by defining a type hierarchy with `Car`, `Motorcycle` and `AbstractVehicle` types. Here is the code:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Car) = true\nispersonal(::Motorcycle) = true\nispersonal(::Truck) = false\nispersonal(::Bus) = false\nispersonal(::Type{<:AbstractVehicle}) = false # default case\n```\n\nIn this code, `ispersonal` is a function that takes an instance of any subtype of the `AbstractVehicle` type and returns true if the vehicle is personal (i.e., a Car or a Motorcycle). The function also handles the case where we are passed a concrete subtype which it does not recognize, in which case it defaults to returning false.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(typeof(Car())) # Example usage with a type instead of an instance\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,343],"elapsed":3.04660895,"_type":"aimessage"}]
