[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

If no trait is defined for a certain type (i.e., if it's either a Bus or Truck), it defaults to false. The function will return true if the vehicle is a Car or Motorcycle, regardless of the value of their traits.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\nmy_car = Car(true)  # A car with a trait\nmy_motorcycle = Motorcycle(false)  # A motorcycle without a trait\nmy_bus = Bus()  # A bus, which doesn't have a trait by default\n\nprintln(ispersonal(my_car))   # prints: true\nprintln(ispersonal(my_motorcycle))   # prints: false\nprintln(ispersonal(my_bus))   # prints: false (default value)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,407],"elapsed":3.775723211,"_type":"aimessage"}]
