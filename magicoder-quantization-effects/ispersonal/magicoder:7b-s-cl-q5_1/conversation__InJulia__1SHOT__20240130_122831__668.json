All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation in Julia using multiple dispatch:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end  # abstract supertype\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end  # subtype for car\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end   # subtype for motorcycle\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end  # subtype for bus\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end   # subtype for truck\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T == Car || T == Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T == Bus || T == Truck\n        return false\n    else \n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\nIn the above code, we define four types `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus` and `Truck` that are subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`. Then we implement a function `ispersonal` which takes in a type parameter `T`. We then use pattern matching to check if `T` is an instance of either Car or Motorcycle, and return true. If it's an instance of Bus or Truck, we return false. For any other subtype, we default to returning false.\n\nYou can test this function with the following example:\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car))  # Outputs: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle))  # Outputs: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus))  # Outputs: false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck))  # Outputs: false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[112,365],"elapsed":3.309697615,"_type":"aimessage"}]
