All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is a possible solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if (T === Car) || (T === Motorcycle)\n        return true\n    elseif (T === Bus) || (T === Truck)\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this code, we define the types `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus` and `Truck` as subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`. The function `ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}` takes a type `T` as an argument, checks if it is one of the types we defined, and returns `true`, `false` or default `false` based on that.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\njulia> Car <: AbstractVehicle\ntrue\n\njulia> Bus <: AbstractVehicle\ntrue\n\njulia> Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle\ntrue\n\njulia> Truck <: AbstractVehicle\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,344],"elapsed":3.153537453,"_type":"aimessage"}]
