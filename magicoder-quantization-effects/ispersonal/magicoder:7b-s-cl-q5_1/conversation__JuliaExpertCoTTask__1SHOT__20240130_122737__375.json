All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia solution for your problem. \n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Type{<:Union{Car,Motorcycle}}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{<:Union{Bus,Truck}}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{<:AbstractVehicle}) = false\n\n# Test example \nfunction test_ispersonal()\n    @test ispersonal(Car) == true\n    @test ispersonal(Motorcycle) == true\n    @test ispersonal(Bus) == false\n    @test ispersonal(Truck) == false\nend\n```\n\nIn this solution, the `ispersonal` function uses type dispatch to handle each subtype of AbstractVehicle. For types Car and Motorcycle it returns true, for Bus and Truck it returns false, and for any other type it defaults to false. \n\nThe test_ispersonal function is used to check that the `ispersonal` function works as expected for all types of vehicles. The `@test` macro is a built-in Julia testing tool which compares the result of an expression with an expected value and prints a failure message if they do not match, or a success message if they do.\n\nYou can run this script in a Julia REPL to check it out.","status":200,"tokens":[0,344],"elapsed":3.146039767,"_type":"aimessage"}]
