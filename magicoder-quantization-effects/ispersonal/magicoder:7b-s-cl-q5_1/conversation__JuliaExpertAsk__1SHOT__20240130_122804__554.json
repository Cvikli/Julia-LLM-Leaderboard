All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can define a function using `function` keyword and provide it with arguments between parentheses `(...)` separated by commas. Here is how you could implement the `ispersonal` function:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = true\nispersonal(::Type) = false # Default case for all other types\n\n# Test function\nfunction test_ispersonal()\n    @test ispersonal(Car) == true\n    @test ispersonal(Motorcycle) == true\n    @test ispersonal(Bus) == false\n    @test ispersonal(Truck) == false\nend\n```\n\nHere, `::Type{Car}` represents a type of `Car`, and `ispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true` means that for any object of type `Car`, the function returns `true`. The default case when the input is not specifically matched to Car or Motorcycle will return `false`.\n\nThe `test_ispersonal()` function is used to test the implementation. \n\nNote: This solution assumes that \"for everyday driving\" means that only cars and motorcycles can be personal vehicles for everyday driving, while buses and trucks cannot. If this isn't correct or if there are other conditions that define a vehicle as being \"personal\", then you should adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,374],"elapsed":3.408314078,"_type":"aimessage"}]
