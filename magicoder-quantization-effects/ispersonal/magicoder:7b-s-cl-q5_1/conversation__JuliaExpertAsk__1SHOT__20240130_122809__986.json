All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a basic implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T == Car || T == Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T == Bus || T == Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function `ispersonal` takes a type as input and checks whether it is an instance of either `Car` or `Motorcycle`. If so, the function returns `true`, indicating that this vehicle can be used for everyday driving. If not (i.e., if the type represents a `Bus` or `Truck`), then the function returns `false`. The default case is handled by returning `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.\n\nFor example:\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car)) # Returns true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle)) # Returns true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus)) # Returns false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck)) # Returns false\nprintln(ispersonal(AbstractVehicle)) # Returns false (default)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,319],"elapsed":2.901997998,"_type":"aimessage"}]
