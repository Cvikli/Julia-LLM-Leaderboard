All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia solution:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle;end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle;end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle;end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle;end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::T) where {T<:Union{Car,Motorcycle}}\n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::T) where {T<:Union{Bus,Truck}}\n    return false\nend\n\nispersonal(::AbstractVehicle) = false  # default value for other subtypes of AbstractVehicle\n```\nIn the example above `Car` and `Motorcycle` will return true when they are passed to the function whereas `Bus` and `Truck` will return false. For any other vehicle type, the function will default to returning false. \n\nFor instance, if you call:\n```julia\nispersonal(Car()) # it returns true\nispersonal(Motorcycle()) # it also returns true\nispersonal(Bus()) # it returns false\nispersonal(Truck()) # it returns false\n```\nAs for other subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`, they will return the default value:\n```julia\nstruct PersonalCar <: Car;end\nispersonal(PersonalCar()) # it returns false, since it is not explicitly handled by the function.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[142,331],"elapsed":3.005361309,"_type":"aimessage"}]
