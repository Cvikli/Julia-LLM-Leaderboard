All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of your request in Julia programming language:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Car})::Bool\n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle})::Bool\n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Truck})::Bool\n    return false\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Bus})::Bool\n    return false\nend\n\nispersonal(x::AbstractVehicle) = ispersonal(typeof(x))\n```\n\nHere, we have defined the `AbstractVehicle` type and four specific vehicle types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. We have implemented the function `ispersonal(::Type{T})::Bool` for each of these types to return the appropriate boolean trait based on their nature. \n\nFinally, we define a default implementation of the function for any other type of `AbstractVehicle`. This implementation simply calls `ispersonal()` on the type of the argument and returns its result. \n\nYou can test this function as follows:\n```julia\ncar = Car()\nmotorcycle = Motorcycle()\nbus = Bus()\ntruck = Truck()\n\nprintln(ispersonal(car))    # prints: true\nprintln(ispersonal(motorcycle))  # prints: true\nprintln(ispersonal(bus))   # prints: false\nprintln(ispersonal(truck))  # prints: false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,390],"elapsed":3.588699536,"_type":"aimessage"}]
