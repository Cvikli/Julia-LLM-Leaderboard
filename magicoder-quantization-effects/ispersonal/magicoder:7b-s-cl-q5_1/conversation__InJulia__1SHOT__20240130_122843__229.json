The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can write this function in Julia. We will create a trait as a boolean value.\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T === Car || T === Motorcycle \n        return true\n    elseif T === Bus || T === Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\nIn the above code, `ispersonal` is a function that takes in a type as an argument. If the provided type (`T`) is either `Car` or `Motorcycle`, it returns true; if it's either `Bus` or `Truck`, it returns false. For any other subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`, it defaults to returning false. \n\nYou can test this function with the following example:\n\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bicycle) # where Bicycle is a subtype of AbstractVehicle but not considered in the function\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,318],"elapsed":2.867148712,"_type":"aimessage"}]
