All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The function `ispersonal(v::T)` is a generic function that takes an instance `v` as argument and returns whether it's a personal vehicle or not. The function checks if the type of the instance matches either Car or Motorcycle and returns true in such cases, returning false otherwise.\n\nWhen you call `ispersonal(Car())`, it will return true because cars are considered to be personal vehicles for everyday driving.","status":200,"tokens":[260,222],"elapsed":3.780173828,"_type":"aimessage"}]
