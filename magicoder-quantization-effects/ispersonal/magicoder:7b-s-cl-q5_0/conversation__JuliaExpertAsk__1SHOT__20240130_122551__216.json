All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia programming language, you can create a function based on the type of argument that it receives using duck typing. Here is how we can solve your problem:\n\n```julia\nabstract AbstractVehicle\ntypealias Car <: AbstractVehicle\ntypealias Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle\ntypealias Bus <: AbstractVehicle\ntypealias Truck <: AbstractVehicle\n\nispersonal(::Car) = true\nispersonal(::Motorcycle) = true\nispersonal(::Bus) = false\nispersonal(::Truck) = false\nispersonal(::AbstractVehicle) = false\n```\nThis function `ispersonal` takes an instance of a vehicle as argument and returns a boolean. If the type of vehicle is Car or Motorcycle, it returns true. For Bus and Truck it returns false. For any other subtypes of AbstractVehicle, it defaults to returning false. \n\nExample:\n```julia\njulia> car = Car()\nCar(...)\n\njulia> motorcycle = Motorcycle()\nMotorcycle(...)\n\njulia> bus = Bus()\nBus(...)\n\njulia> truck = Truck()\nTruck(...)\n\njulia> ispersonal(car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(motorcycle)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(truck)\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,340],"elapsed":2.887591102,"_type":"aimessage"}]
