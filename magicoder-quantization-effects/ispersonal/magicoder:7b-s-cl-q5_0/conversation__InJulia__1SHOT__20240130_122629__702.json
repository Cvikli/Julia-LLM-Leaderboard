All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution in Julia.

It correctly identifies that a Car or Motorcycle is a personal vehicle, whereas a Bus or Truck is not. For any other subtype of AbstractVehicle, it defaults to returning false.","status":200,"tokens":[0,326],"elapsed":2.753546635,"_type":"aimessage"}]
