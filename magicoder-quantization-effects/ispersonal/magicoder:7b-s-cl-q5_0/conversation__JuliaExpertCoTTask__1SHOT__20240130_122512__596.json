For types Bus and Truck, it returns false, because those are not generally used for everyday driving (they are typically used for work or long trips). The default case, when the type is not Car or Motorcycle, Bus, or Truck, also returns false.","status":200,"tokens":[0,220],"elapsed":1.924481136,"_type":"aimessage"}]
