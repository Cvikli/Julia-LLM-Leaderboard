All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem using Julia programming language:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nabstract type Vehicle <: AbstractVehicle end\nabstract type Car <: Vehicle end\nabstract type Motorcycle <: Vehicle end\nabstract type Bus <: Vehicle end\nabstract type Truck <: Vehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T <: Car || T <: Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T <: Bus || T <: Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false # default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle\n    end\nend\n```\nThe `ispersonal` function checks the provided type against each specific type using the `<:` operator, which checks if one type is a subtype of another. If the provided type is a subtype of Car or Motorcycle, it returns true because these are personal vehicles. For any other types (Bus and Truck), it returns false. For all other subtypes of AbstractVehicle, it defaults to returning false.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(AbstractVehicle) # This will return false because AbstractVehicle itself does not meet the condition of a personal vehicle.\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,370],"elapsed":3.140813351,"_type":"aimessage"}]
