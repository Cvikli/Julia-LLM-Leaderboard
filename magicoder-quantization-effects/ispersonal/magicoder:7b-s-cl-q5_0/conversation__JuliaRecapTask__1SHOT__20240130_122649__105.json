[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving.

We then define four subtypes: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. \n\nWe create a function `ispersonal(::Type{T})`, where `T` is the type of the vehicle we are testing, to determine if it's a personal vehicle for everyday driving or not. For our specific problem (only cars and motorcycles should return true), this function returns always true when the input type is Car or Motorcycle, otherwise false.\n\nLastly, we test our `ispersonal` function with an array of four different vehicles: a car, a motorcycle, a bus, and a truck. The function will print out whether each vehicle is personal for everyday driving or not.","status":200,"tokens":[0,425],"elapsed":3.71066804,"_type":"aimessage"}]
