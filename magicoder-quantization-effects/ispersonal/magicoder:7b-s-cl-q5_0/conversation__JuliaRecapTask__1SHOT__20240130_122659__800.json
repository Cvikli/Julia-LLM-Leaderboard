[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

For each type that represents a personal vehicle (Car and Motorcycle), we define a function `ispersonal(::Type{T})::Bool` where `T` is the corresponding type, which returns `true`. \n\nFor types representing non-personal vehicles (Bus and Truck), we define a similar function but with `false`. In the case that Julia can't find any matching definition for the given type `v`, it will fall back to use the default implementation that returns `false`.\n\nIf you want to test your function, you can call it like this:\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car)) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle)) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus)) # false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck)) # false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,390],"elapsed":3.413428509,"_type":"aimessage"}]
