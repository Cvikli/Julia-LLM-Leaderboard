If it's a subtype of Car or Motorcycle then the function returns true, if it's a subtype of Bus or Truck then it returns false. For any other types, it returns false. \n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car())) # Should return true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle())) # Should also return true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus())) # Should return false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck())) # Should return false\nprintln(ispersonal(AbstractVehicle)) # Should return false as it's a supertype of the given types\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,300],"elapsed":2.518235168,"_type":"aimessage"}]
