All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution in Julia programming language that uses abstract and concrete types to define personal and non-personal vehicles:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\n# Personal vehicles\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\n\n# Non-personal vehicles\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction is_personal(::Type{Car})\n    return true\nend\n\nfunction is_personal(::Type{Motorcycle})\n    return true\nend\n\nfunction is_personal(::Type{Truck})\n    return false\nend\n\nfunction is_personal(::Type{Bus})\n    return false\nend\n\n# Default case\nfunction is_personal(::Type{T<:AbstractVehicle}) where T\n    return false\nend\n```\nThis function `is_personal` checks if a provided Vehicle type is personal by examining its subtype. If it matches any of the defined personal vehicles, true is returned, otherwise false is returned. The default case handles all other types that do not match any of the concrete vehicle types and returns false as well.\n\nHere is an example usage:\n```julia\nprintln(is_personal(Car))         # prints: true\nprintln(is_personal(Motorcycle))   # prints: true\nprintln(is_personal(Bus))          # prints: false\nprintln(is_personal(Truck))        # prints: false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[142,354],"elapsed":3.997101919,"_type":"aimessage"}]
