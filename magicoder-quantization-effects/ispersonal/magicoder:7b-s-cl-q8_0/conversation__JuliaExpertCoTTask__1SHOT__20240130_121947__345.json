All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Here is how you could do it:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end  # Abstract Vehicle type\n\n# Concrete types that inherit from AbstractVehicle type\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nispersonal(::T) where {T<:Union{Car,Motorcycle}} = true  # Trait for personal vehicles\nispersonal(::T) where {T<:Union{Bus,Truck}} = false  # Trait for non-personal vehicles\nispersonal(::AbstractVehicle) = false  # Default trait for other types of Vehicles\n```\nIn this code, we define the `AbstractVehicle` as an abstract type. Then we define concrete types that inherit from it: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. We use the `ispersonal` function to return a trait based on whether the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle or not. This function uses type parametric programming, which allows us to define behavior for specific types of parameters (in this case, subtypes of AbstractVehicle).","status":200,"tokens":[0,306],"elapsed":3.48380134,"_type":"aimessage"}]
