All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution in Julia programming language:\n```julia\nabstract Vehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: Vehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: Vehicle end\nstruct Bus <: Vehicle end\nstruct Truck <: Vehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:Vehicle} \n    if T == Car || T == Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T == Bus || T == Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this code, we define an abstract type `Vehicle` and four concrete types: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`.\nThe function `ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:Vehicle}` takes a type as input and returns a boolean value. This function checks if the provided type is either `Car` or `Motorcycle` which would return `true`, otherwise it checks if the type is either `Bus` or `Truck`. If none of these conditions are met, the function returns `false`.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,295],"elapsed":3.299813906,"_type":"aimessage"}]
