All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia programming language, you can define a function as follows:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Car)\n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Motorcycle)\n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Truck)\n    return false\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Bus)\n    return false\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(v::AbstractVehicle)\n    return false\nend\n```\nHere, we've defined a hierarchy of subtypes where the specific types `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Truck` and `Bus` are derived from `AbstractVehicle`. We then define separate methods for the function `ispersonal(::Type{T})` that return whether or not each type is personal, based on our defined hierarchy.\n\nFor example, we can call the function with a specific vehicle as follows:\n\n```julia\njulia> Car() |> ispersonal\ntrue\n\njulia> Bus() |> ispersonal\nfalse\n\njulia> Truck() |> ispersonal\nfalse\n\njulia> Motorcycle() |> ispersonal\ntrue\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,324],"elapsed":3.70045098,"_type":"aimessage"}]
