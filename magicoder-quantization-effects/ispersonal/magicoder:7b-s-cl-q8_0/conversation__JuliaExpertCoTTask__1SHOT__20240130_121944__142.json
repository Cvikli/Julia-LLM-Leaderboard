All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's a way you could write this `ispersonal` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle} = T in (Car, Motorcycle)\nispersonal(x::AbstractVehicle) = ispersonal(typeof(x))\n```\n\nIn this code, `ispersonal` checks if the input type `T` belongs to either the `Car` or `Motorcycle` subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`. If it does, the function returns true (for personal vehicles). Otherwise, it returns false.\n\nYou can use the function as follows:\n\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car))  # Returns: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus))  # Returns: false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck))  # Returns: false\n```\n\nNote that this code assumes you want to check if the type is a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`, not if an instance of a vehicle is a `Car` or `Motorcycle`. If you'd like to check instances, use the second definition of `ispersonal`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,322],"elapsed":3.65066939,"_type":"aimessage"}]
