All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is a simple Julia code solution for your problem.\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T === Car || T === Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T === Bus || T === Truck\n        return false\n    else \n        return false # Default case for other subtypes of AbstractVehicle.\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this code, `ispersonal` is a function that takes in an instance of some type `T <: AbstractVehicle`, and returns whether the vehicle is personal (i.e., it can be driven by one person). If the type `T` is `Car` or `Motorcycle`, then it is considered personal. If it's a `Bus` or `Truck`, then it isn't. For all other subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`, it returns false, as per your default case requirement.\n\nFor example:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,319],"elapsed":5.62589908,"_type":"aimessage"}]
