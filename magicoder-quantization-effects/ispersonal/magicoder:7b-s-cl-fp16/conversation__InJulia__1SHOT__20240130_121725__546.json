We then define a function `ispersonal` which checks if the provided vehicle is a Car or Motorcycle it returns true, for Vehicles like Bus and Truck it return false and for any other types of vehicles it defaults to returning false.\n\nHere's an example of using this function:\n\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(AbstractVehicle())  # This will return false\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,333],"elapsed":5.798380471,"_type":"aimessage"}]
