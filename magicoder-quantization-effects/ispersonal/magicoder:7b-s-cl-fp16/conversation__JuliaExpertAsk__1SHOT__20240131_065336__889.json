All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible solution in Julia programming language:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(v::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T == Car || T == Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T == Bus || T == Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this code, we define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and four concrete types: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. The function `ispersonal(v::T)` checks the type of input `v` and returns a boolean value based on whether it's a personal vehicle or not. If the type is neither `Car` nor `Motorcycle`, but it is either `Bus` or `Truck`, it will return false. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, the function defaults to returning false.\n\nFor example, if you call `ispersonal(Car())`, it returns `true`. If you call `ispersonal(Truck())`, it returns `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,297],"elapsed":5.125229663,"_type":"aimessage"}]
