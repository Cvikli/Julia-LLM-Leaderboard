Then we implement the function `ispersonal(v::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}`. This function checks if the provided vehicle is a personal vehicle by checking its type. If it's either a car or motorcycle, it returns true (indicating that this vehicle can be driven for everyday driving). If it's a bus or truck, it returns false (indicating that these vehicles are not typically used for daily driving). For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, the function defaults to returning false.\n\nFor example:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(SubtypeOfAbstractVehicle()) # this will return false, as it's not a defined subtype\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,393],"elapsed":6.801871088,"_type":"aimessage"}]
