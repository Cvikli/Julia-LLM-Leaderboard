The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

If it's a subtype of Car or Motorcycle, it returns true (indicating that the vehicle is personal). If it's a subtype of Bus or Truck, it returns false (indicating that the vehicle is not personal). For any other subtype of AbstractVehicle, it defaults to returning false.\n\nHere is an example usage:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(AbstractVehicle())\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[112,313],"elapsed":5.433602469,"_type":"aimessage"}]
