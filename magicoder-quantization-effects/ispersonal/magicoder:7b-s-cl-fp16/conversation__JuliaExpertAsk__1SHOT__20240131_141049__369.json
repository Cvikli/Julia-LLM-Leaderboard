All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia program that defines `ispersonal` and uses it with some subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Car)\n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Motorcycle)\n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Bus)\n    return false\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Truck)\n    return false\nend\n\nispersonal(::AbstractVehicle) = false # Default case for other subtypes\n```\nIn the above code, `ispersonal` function checks whether the provided vehicle type is a personal one or not. If the vehicle type is Car or Motorcycle, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false. The default case handles any other subtype of AbstractVehicle and also handles cases where the input might not be a subtype at all (in which case it will return false).\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car())) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle())) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus())) # false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck())) # false\nprintln(ispersonal(AbstractVehicle())) # false (default case)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,341],"elapsed":5.917196668,"_type":"aimessage"}]
