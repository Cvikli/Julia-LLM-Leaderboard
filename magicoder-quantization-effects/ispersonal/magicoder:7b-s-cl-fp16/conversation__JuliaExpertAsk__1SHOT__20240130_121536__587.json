All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia solution that uses multiple dispatch and abstract types to solve this problem:\n\n```julia\nabstract type Vehicle end\nabstract type AbstractVehicle <: Vehicle end\nabstract type Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nabstract type Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nabstract type Bus <: Vehicle end\nabstract type Truck <: Vehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Bus}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{Truck}) = false\nispersonal(t) = false\n```\nIn this solution, we define five types: `Vehicle`, `AbstractVehicle`, `Car`, `Motorcycle`, and `Bus`. We then declare that `Car` and `Motorcycle` are subtypes of `AbstractVehicle` and `Bus` is a subtype of `Vehicle`.\n\nWe then define the function `ispersonal` with multiple dispatch. This function returns true if we call it on a type that is either `Car` or `Motorcycle`, and false for `Bus` and `Truck`. For any other type, it defaults to returning false. \n\nNow let's test the function:\n\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car)) # prints true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle)) # prints true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus)) # prints false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck)) # prints false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,357],"elapsed":6.2318374,"_type":"aimessage"}]
