It returns true if the input is of type Car or Motorcycle, and false otherwise. If the input is not one of these types, it uses the default definition which also returns false. \n\nThe function call `ispersonal(Car())` will return true since a car is a personal vehicle for everyday driving.","status":200,"tokens":[0,242],"elapsed":4.261864395,"_type":"aimessage"}]
