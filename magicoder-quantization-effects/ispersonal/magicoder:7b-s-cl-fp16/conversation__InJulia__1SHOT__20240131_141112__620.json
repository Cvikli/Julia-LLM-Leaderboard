All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible solution in Julia. This solution assumes that you have defined the types `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus` and `Truck`.\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T == Car || T == Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T == Bus || T == Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses parametric polymorphism in Julia, which allows it to handle different types in the same way. The `where {T<:AbstractVehicle}` part of the function definition means that `T` must be a subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. \n\nThe function then checks if the type `T` is one of the four specified types (`Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, or `Truck`). If it is, it returns true. If it's not any of those types but is a subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, it returns false.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use this function:\n\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(AbstractVehicle())  # Returns false, because AbstractVehicle isn't a subtype of Car, Motorcycle, Bus or Truck.\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[112,414],"elapsed":7.188379165,"_type":"aimessage"}]
