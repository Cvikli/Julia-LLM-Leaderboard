The function `ispersonal(v::T)` checks if the provided vehicle is a personal vehicle or not. If the vehicle type is either a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`, it returns true, indicating that these vehicles are personal for everyday driving. On the other hand, if the vehicle type is either a `Bus` or a `Truck`, it returns false, as they are generally used for commercial purposes rather than personal ones. For any other subtype of AbstractVehicle, it defaults to returning false.\n\nHere's an example:\n```julia\njulia> Car() |> ispersonal\ntrue\n\njulia> Motorcycle() |> ispersonal\ntrue\n\njulia> Bus() |> ispersonal\nfalse\n\njulia> Truck() |> ispersonal\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,359],"elapsed":6.218149661,"_type":"aimessage"}]
