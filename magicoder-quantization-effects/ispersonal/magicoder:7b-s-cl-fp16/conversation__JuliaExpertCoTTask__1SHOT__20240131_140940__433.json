We also define a function `ispersonal` that takes in the type of these subtypes as arguments. For `Car` and `Motorcycle`, it returns true, while for `Bus` and `Truck`, it returns false. The default case where the input is not one of the specific types is handled by returning false for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. We test the function with example data to verify that it works as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[0,304],"elapsed":5.283887143,"_type":"aimessage"}]
