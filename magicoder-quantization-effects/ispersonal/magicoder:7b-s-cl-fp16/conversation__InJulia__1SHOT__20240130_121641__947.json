All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

We assume each type has an attribute named `trait` that indicates whether it's personal or not:\n\n```julia\nabstract Vehicle end  # abstract supertype of all vehicles\n\nstruct Car <: Vehicle\n    trait::Bool\nend\nstruct Motorcycle <: Vehicle\n    trait::Bool\nend\nstruct Bus <: Vehicle\n    trait::Bool\nend\nstruct Truck <: Vehicle\n    trait::Bool\nend\n\nispersonal(vehicle::T) where {T<:Vehicle} = vehicle.trait\n```\n\nLet's test the function with examples:\n\n```julia\ncar = Car(true)  # a car that is personal\nmotorcycle = Motorcycle(false)  # a motorcycle that is not personal\nbus = Bus(true)  # a bus that is personal\ntruck = Truck(false)  # a truck that is not personal\n\n@assert ispersonal(car) == true\n@assert ispersonal(motorcycle) == false\n@assert ispersonal(bus) == true\n@assert ispersonal(truck) == false\n```\n\nThis program assumes `trait` for each type indicates whether it's personal or not. It can be updated according to the actual needs and data.","status":200,"tokens":[0,314],"elapsed":5.45862773,"_type":"aimessage"}]
