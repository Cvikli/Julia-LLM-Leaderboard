All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

We then write a function `ispersonal(v::T)` that takes in a subtype of `AbstractVehicle` (represented by the generic type `T`) and returns whether it is a personal vehicle or not.\n\nIf the input `v` is an instance of either `Car` or `Motorcycle`, the function will return true, because these are personal vehicles for everyday driving. If the input `v` is an instance of either `Bus` or `Truck`, the function will return false, as these are not typically used for daily commuting and are more suited to professional use. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, the function defaults to returning false.\n\nHere's how you can test this function:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(AbstractVehicle)  # This will return false, because AbstractVehicle itself isn't a personal vehicle.\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,438],"elapsed":7.623799291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
