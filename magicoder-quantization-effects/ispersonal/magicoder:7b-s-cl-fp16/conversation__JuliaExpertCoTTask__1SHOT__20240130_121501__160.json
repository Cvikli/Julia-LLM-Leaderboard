All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation in Julia that fulfills these requirements:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(v::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    return (T == Car || T == Motorcycle) ? true : false\nend\n```\nThe function `ispersonal` takes an instance of a subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. It uses the `where` keyword to specify that the type `T` must be a subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. Then it checks if `T` is either `Car` or `Motorcycle` and returns `true` in that case, otherwise it defaults to returning `false`.\n\nYou can test this function with some examples:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n```\nAs expected, the function returns `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle` instances and `false` for other types.","status":200,"tokens":[0,305],"elapsed":5.385803459,"_type":"aimessage"}]
