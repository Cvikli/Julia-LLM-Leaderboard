All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract Vehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: Vehicle end \nstruct Motorcycle <: Vehicle end \nstruct Bus <: Vehicle end\nstruct Truck <: Vehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Car})\n    true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle})\n    true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Bus})\n    false\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Truck})\n    false\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{<:Vehicle})  # default value for other types\n    false\nend\n```\nThis function `ispersonal` will return the trait of personal vehicle or not, depending upon its input. For instance, if you call `ispersonal(Car)`, it will return `true`, as a Car is a personal vehicle. If you call `ispersonal(Bus)`, it will return `false`. For any other type of Vehicle (like Truck), it returns the default value which is also false. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that only the Car and Motorcycle types are personal vehicles, while Bus and Truck types are not. You can adjust the conditions according to your needs.","status":200,"tokens":[0,292],"elapsed":5.191184748,"_type":"aimessage"}]
