[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving.

The function `ispersonal(::Type{T})` takes a type as input and returns whether it is a personal vehicle or not. For the types Car and Motorcycle, the function returns true. For Bus and Truck, the function returns false. For any other subtype of AbstractVehicle (e.g., Bike), the function also returns false. \n\nNow let's test this function with the example:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bike)\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,312],"elapsed":5.47677191,"_type":"aimessage"}]
