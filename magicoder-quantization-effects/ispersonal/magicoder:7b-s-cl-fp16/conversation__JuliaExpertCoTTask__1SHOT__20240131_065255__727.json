All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Then, we define a function `ispersonal(v::AbstractVehicle)` that returns false by default for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. For the specific types Car and Motorcycle, it returns true. The same goes for Bus and Truck - they return false.\n\nYou can test this function with an example:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,309],"elapsed":5.342232982,"_type":"aimessage"}]
