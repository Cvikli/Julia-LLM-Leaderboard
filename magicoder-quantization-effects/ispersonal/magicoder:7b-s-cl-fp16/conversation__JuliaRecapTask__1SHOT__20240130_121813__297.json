[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

For any type other than Car and Motorcycle, it defaults to returning false because these are the only subtypes of AbstractVehicle that are known to be personal vehicles for everyday driving. If you call the function with an instance of either Car or Motorcycle, it returns true since these are indeed personal vehicles.\n\nFor example:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car()) # Returns true\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle()) # Returns true\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus()) # Returns false\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck()) # Returns false\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,339],"elapsed":5.981472596,"_type":"aimessage"}]
