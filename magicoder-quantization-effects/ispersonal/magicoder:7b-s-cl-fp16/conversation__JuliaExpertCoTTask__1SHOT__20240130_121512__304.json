Based on the type of the vehicle, it returns whether or not it is a personal vehicle. We then test our function with four different types of vehicles (Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck). For Car and Motorcycle, we get true, for Bus and Truck, we get false.\n\n\nNote: In Julia, methods are automatically dispatched based on the type of the object at runtime. Hence there is no need to explicitly write down the function for each subtype of AbstractVehicle. This approach helps keep the code concise and also easier to maintain in the future if more subtypes are added.","status":200,"tokens":[0,373],"elapsed":6.593719926,"_type":"aimessage"}]
