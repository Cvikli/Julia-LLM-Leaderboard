All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Then it defines a function `ispersonal` for each of these types that returns true or false depending on the vehicle's nature. The default case is handled by returning false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.\n\nHere is an example usage:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(AbstractVehicle()) # Default case, can be omitted if all subtypes are covered.\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,320],"elapsed":2.580598708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
