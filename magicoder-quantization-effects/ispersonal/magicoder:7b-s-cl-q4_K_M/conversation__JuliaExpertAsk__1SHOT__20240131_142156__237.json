All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple implementation of `ispersonal` in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    return T == Car || T == Motorcycle\nend\n```\n\nThis implementation uses Julia's subtyping mechanism to determine if a given Vehicle type `T` is a personal vehicle. The function `ispersonal(::Type{T})` returns true for types `Car` and `Motorcycle`, as these are the only two types that are considered \"personal\" according to your description. For all other subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`, it defaults to false.\n\nYou can use this function with an example like so:\n\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,282],"elapsed":2.254021493,"_type":"aimessage"}]
