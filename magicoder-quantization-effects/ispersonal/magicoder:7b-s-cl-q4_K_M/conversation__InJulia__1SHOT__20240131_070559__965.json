All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can define this `ispersonal` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T == Car || T == Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T == Bus || T == Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\n\nYou can test this function with the following code:\n\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car))  # returns: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle))  # returns: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus))  # returns: false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck))  # returns: false\n```\n\nThis function works by pattern matching the input type `T` against known types. If `T` is a subtype of `Car` or `Motorcycle`, it returns `true`. If `T` is a subtype of `Bus` or `Truck`, it returns `false`. For any other type, it defaults to returning `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,302],"elapsed":2.384925472,"_type":"aimessage"}]
