All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia solution that satisfies your requirements:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Car})\n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle})\n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Bus})\n    return false\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Truck})\n    return false\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{<:AbstractVehicle})\n    return false\nend\n```\nIn this code, we define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and four concrete types `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. Each of these types has a function `ispersonal` defined for it. The default implementation (`::Type{<:AbstractVehicle}`) returns false, meaning that any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle` will return false unless an explicit implementation is provided.\n\nHere's how you could use this function in practice:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(typealias Vehicle = Union{Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck})\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,373],"elapsed":2.990450998,"_type":"aimessage"}]
