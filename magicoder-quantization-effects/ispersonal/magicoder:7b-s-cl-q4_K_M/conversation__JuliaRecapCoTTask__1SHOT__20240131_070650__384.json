[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The `::Type{T}` syntax is used to specify that we are dealing with types, and `<: AbstractVehicle` specifies that this type is a subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. \n\nThe function uses a conditional statement to check if the input type is either `Car` or `Motorcycle`, returning true. For `Bus` and `Truck`, it returns false, as they are not personal vehicles for everyday driving. If the input type does not match any of these, it defaults to return false.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(AbstractVehicle)\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,364],"elapsed":2.979861531,"_type":"aimessage"}]
