The function `ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}` is defined to return true for `Car` and `Motorcycle` (which are personal vehicles) and false for `Bus` and `Truck` (which are not). For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, the function returns false.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(typealias AbstractVehicle) # returns false, as it's not a specific type of vehicle\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,365],"elapsed":2.90122912,"_type":"aimessage"}]
