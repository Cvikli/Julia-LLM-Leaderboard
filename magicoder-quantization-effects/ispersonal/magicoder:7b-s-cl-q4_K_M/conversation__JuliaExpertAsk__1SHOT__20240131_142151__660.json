All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(v::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T == Car || T == Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T == Bus || T == Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this code, we define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and four specific types: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus` and `Truck`. The function `ispersonal(v::T)` takes a parameter of any type that is a subtype of `AbstractVehicle` (i.e., it's either one of the specific types or a descendant thereof).\n\nThe function checks if the input type `T` is equal to `Car` or `Motorcycle`, in which case it returns true, meaning that these are personal vehicles. It also checks for `Bus` and `Truck` returning false, as they are not considered personal vehicles. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, the function defaults to returning false.\n\nFor example:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(typeof(Car()))\ntrue\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,388],"elapsed":3.110923166,"_type":"aimessage"}]
