All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is a possible implementation in Julia. Firstly, we define some subtypes under `AbstractVehicle`:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T == Car || T == Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T == Bus || T == Truck\n        return false\n    else \n        return false # Default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this implementation, we have `ispersonal` function that takes a type `T<:AbstractVehicle`. It then checks if the input type is either a Car or Motorcycle (in which case it returns true), a Bus or Truck (which returns false), or any other subtype of AbstractVehicle (which defaults to returning false).\n\nHere's an example usage of this function:\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car))       # Outputs: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle))  # Outputs: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus))        # Outputs: false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck))      # Outputs: false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,321],"elapsed":2.594752697,"_type":"aimessage"}]
