The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

We then define the function `ispersonal` to return a boolean value based on whether the input vehicle is a personal vehicle. The function uses pattern matching to handle different cases for each type of vehicle, with default behavior set for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.","status":200,"tokens":[142,308],"elapsed":2.475277585,"_type":"aimessage"}]
