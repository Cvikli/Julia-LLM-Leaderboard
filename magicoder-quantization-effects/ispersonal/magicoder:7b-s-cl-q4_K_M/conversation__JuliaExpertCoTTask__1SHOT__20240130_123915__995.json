All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

It returns `true` if it is, and `false` otherwise. If you pass in a type that's not Car or Motorcycle, it will return false because those are the only two types defined for personal vehicles.","status":200,"tokens":[0,191],"elapsed":1.537478338,"_type":"aimessage"}]
