All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia solution for your problem using parametric polymorphism (multiple dispatch) and abstract types:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end  # supertype\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end   # subtype\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end  # subtype\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end    # subtype\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end   # subtype\n\nispersonal(::Car) = true   # function specialization for Car type\nispersonal(::Motorcycle) = true  # function specialization for Motorcycle type\nispersonal(::Bus) = false    # function specialization for Bus type\nispersonal(::Truck) = false   # function specialization for Truck type\n\n# example usage:\ncar = Car()\nbus = Bus()\nmotorcycle = Motorcycle()\ntruck = Truck()\n\nprintln(ispersonal(car))  # outputs true\nprintln(ispersonal(bus))  # outputs false\nprintln(ispersonal(motorcycle))  # outputs true\nprintln(ispersonal(truck))  # outputs false\n```\nIn this code, `AbstractVehicle` is the supertype and `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck` are subtypes. The function `ispersonal` uses multiple dispatch to handle each specific subtype differently.","status":200,"tokens":[0,322],"elapsed":2.592034854,"_type":"aimessage"}]
