All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

It then defines the function `ispersonal(::T)` where `T<: AbstractVehicle`, returning `true` if the input is a Motorcycle or Bus (since they are personal vehicles), `false` if it's a Truck (since it isn't used for daily driving), and defaulting to `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. \n\nFinally, we test the function with an example.","status":200,"tokens":[0,309],"elapsed":2.499823134,"_type":"aimessage"}]
