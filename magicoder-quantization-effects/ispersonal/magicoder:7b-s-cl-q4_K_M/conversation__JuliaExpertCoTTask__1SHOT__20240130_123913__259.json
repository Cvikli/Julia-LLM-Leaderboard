All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Then, it defines four subtypes of `Vehicle`: Car, Motorcycle, Bus and Truck. For everyday driving, we can assume that a car or motorcycle is \"personal\" (returning true), while a bus or truck are not (returning false). The function `ispersonal` is then defined with two methods: one for each type of vehicle. When called with an instance of a subtype of Vehicle, it returns the correct value based on its subtype. \n\nThe `@assert` line at the end tests whether our function correctly identifies the \"personal\" vehicles. If you run this code, you should see no output: this means that `ispersonal` is working as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[260,334],"elapsed":4.158209895,"_type":"aimessage"}]
