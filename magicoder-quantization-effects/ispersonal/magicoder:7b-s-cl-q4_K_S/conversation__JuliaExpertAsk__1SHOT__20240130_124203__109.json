All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia program that defines a method `ispersonal` in a module:\n\n```julia\nmodule Vehicles\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T <: AbstractVehicle}\n    if T == Car || T == Motorcycle \n        return true\n    elseif T == Bus || T == Truck \n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n\nusing .Vehicles\n\n# Testing the function\n@show Vehicles.ispersonal(Car) # Returns: true\n@show Vehicles.ispersonal(Motorcycle) # Returns: true\n@show Vehicles.ispersonal(Bus) # Returns: false\n@show Vehicles.ispersonal(Truck) # Returns: false\n```\n\nIn this program, we define a module `Vehicles` and use abstract types to define the type hierarchy for different types of vehicles. We then define a function `ispersonal` in that module that accepts a type as an argument. The function returns true if the given type is `Car` or `Motorcycle`, and false otherwise (i.e., it's a bus or truck). \n\nYou can test this function with different types of vehicles by calling it with those types.","status":200,"tokens":[0,346],"elapsed":2.682212924,"_type":"aimessage"}]
