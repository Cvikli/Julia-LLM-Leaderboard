All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation in Julia:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    return false\nend\n\nispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Bus}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{Truck}) = false\n```\nIn the above code, we define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and four specific types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The function `ispersonal` is defined to return a trait (in this case just returning `false`) if the provided Vehicle type is not one of Car or Motorcycle. If you call `ispersonal(Car)` or `ispersonal(Motorcycle)`, it will return `true`. For other types like Bus and Truck, function will still return false (since we didn't override this for these types).\nPlease note that in Julia, functions can be overloaded for concrete types, and the most specific type is used when multiple methods match.","status":200,"tokens":[0,299],"elapsed":2.306483254,"_type":"aimessage"}]
