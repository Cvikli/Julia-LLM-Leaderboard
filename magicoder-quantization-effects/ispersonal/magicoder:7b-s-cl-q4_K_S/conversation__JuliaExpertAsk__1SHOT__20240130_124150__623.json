All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple solution in Julia using a dispatch based approach:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Car) = true\nispersonal(::Motorcycle) = true\nispersonal(::Bus) = false\nispersonal(::Truck) = false\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    return false # default for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle\nend\n```\nHere we define 4 types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck which are all subtypes of the abstract type `AbstractVehicle`.\n\nWe then define a function `ispersonal` that takes these types as arguments and returns specific traits (boolean values) for them. If the argument is not one of these 4 types, the default case returns false.","status":200,"tokens":[0,232],"elapsed":1.769666504,"_type":"aimessage"}]
