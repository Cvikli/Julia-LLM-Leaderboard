All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can solve it in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T <: Car || T <: Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T <: Bus || T <: Truck \n        return false\n    else\n        return false   # default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle\n    end\nend\n```\nYou can call this function with types as arguments to get the results. For example, `ispersonal(Car)` will return `true`, and `ispersonal(Truck)` will return `false`.\n\nThis is an example of using a type dispatch in Julia to solve this problem. Type dispatch is one of the key features that makes Julia a powerful language for metaprogramming tasks.","status":200,"tokens":[0,239],"elapsed":1.826057917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
