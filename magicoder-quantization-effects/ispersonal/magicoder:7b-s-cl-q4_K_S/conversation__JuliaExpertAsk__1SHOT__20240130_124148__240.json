All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nispersonal(::Car) = true\nispersonal(::Motorcycle) = true\nispersonal(::Bus) = false\nispersonal(::Truck) = false\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    return false\nend\n```\nIn this code, we first define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle`. Then we define concrete types of vehicles: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. Each of these types is a subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. \n\nWe then provide two functions `ispersonal` that return true if the vehicle type provided is one of the two personal vehicle types: Car or Motorcycle. We also define another function `ispersonal` for any other kind of `AbstractVehicle`, which defaults to false. If you call `ispersonal(::Car)` or `ispersonal(::Motorcycle())`, it will return true, while calling `ispersonal(::Bus)` and `ispersonal(::Truck)` would return false.\n\nHere is an example:\n```julia\njulia> Car() |> ispersonal\ntrue\n\njulia> Motorcycle() |> ispersonal\ntrue\n\njulia> Bus() |> ispersonal\nfalse\n\njulia> Truck() |> ispersonal\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[142,388],"elapsed":3.063363545,"_type":"aimessage"}]
