All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The function `ispersonal` is defined such that if you pass in an instance of a `Car` or `Motorcycle`, it returns `true`; for `Bus` and `Truck`, it returns `false`. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, the default implementation returns `false`.\n\nIf you want to test this function, you can simply call it with an instance of a vehicle:\n\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,309],"elapsed":2.380484963,"_type":"aimessage"}]
