If it is, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false. \n\nThis implementation ensures that we only check for `Car` and `Motorcycle`, because those are the types that qualify as personal vehicles for everyday driving according to the problem statement. Any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle` would return false by default.","status":200,"tokens":[0,291],"elapsed":2.192948945,"_type":"aimessage"}]
