All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you could implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle <: Vehicle end\nabstract type Car <: Vehicle end \nabstract type Motorcycle <: Vehicle end \nabstract type Bus <: Vehicle end \nabstract type Truck <: Vehicle end \n\nispersonal(v::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle} = false\nispersonal(v::Car) = true\nispersonal(v::Motorcycle) = true\n```\nIn the above code, we have defined an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` that is a supertype of all types of vehicles. We then define subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`, such as `Car`, `Motorcycle`, etc., each corresponding to a different kind of vehicle. We then implement our function `ispersonal`, which defaults to returning `false` for any type that is not explicitly handled, and it returns `true` for the `Car` and `Motorcycle`. \n\nFor example:\n```julia\njulia> v = Car()\nCar(...)\n\njulia> ispersonal(v)\ntrue\n\njulia> w = Truck()\nTruck(...)\n\njulia> ispersonal(w)\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,300],"elapsed":2.271822798,"_type":"aimessage"}]
