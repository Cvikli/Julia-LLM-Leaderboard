All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

It then checks if `T` is either a subtype of `Motorcycle` or `Car`, and returns true if it matches any of these. If not, it checks if `T` is a subtype of `Bus` or `Truck`, and returns false in those cases as well. Finally, if the vehicle type does not match either of the two categories, we assume that it is neither personal nor non-personal and return false.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\njulia> Vehicle = Motorcycle\nMotorcycle\n\njulia> ispersonal(Vehicle)\ntrue\n\njulia> Vehicle = Truck\nTruck\n\njulia> ispersonal(Vehicle)\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,353],"elapsed":2.677677658,"_type":"aimessage"}]
