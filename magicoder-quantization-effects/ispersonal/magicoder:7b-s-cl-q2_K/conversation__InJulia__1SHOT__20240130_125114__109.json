As such, the `ispersonal` function returns `true` for both a `Car` and a `Motorcycle`. The same logic applies to a `Bus` and a `Truck`, making them not qualify as personal vehicles. \n\nKeep in mind that this is an abstract example and might need modification according to the specific requirements of your program.","status":200,"tokens":[0,407],"elapsed":3.079763998,"_type":"aimessage"}]
