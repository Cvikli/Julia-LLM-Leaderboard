The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

If the vehicle is either Car or Motorcycle, it returns true, meaning that this kind of vehicle can be considered as personal for everyday driving. On the other hand, if the vehicle is Bus or Truck, it returns false, indicating that these types are not suitable for daily driving. For any other subtype of AbstractVehicle (like Bike), it defaults to returning false.\n\nAn example usage can be:\n```julia\njulia> Car() |> ispersonal\ntrue\n\njulia> Motorcycle() |> ispersonal\ntrue\n\njulia> Bus() |> ispersonal\nfalse\n\njulia> Truck() |> ispersonal\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,353],"elapsed":2.653673516,"_type":"aimessage"}]
