All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The function `ispersonal(v::T)` checks the type of the input `v`. If it is either a Car or a Motorcycle, it returns true; if it's either a Bus or a Truck, it returns false; otherwise (for any other subtype), it defaults to returning false.\n\nFor example:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,301],"elapsed":2.271482466,"_type":"aimessage"}]
