All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The function `ispersonal` checks if a given vehicle type is personal or not by using pattern matching to compare each input with known subtypes of AbstractVehicle (i.e., Car and Motorcycle return true, Bus and Truck return false). If the input does not match any of these types, it defaults to returning false as specified in the else clause.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,279],"elapsed":2.125590115,"_type":"aimessage"}]
