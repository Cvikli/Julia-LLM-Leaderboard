All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The function `ispersonal` checks the type of the provided vehicle, and returns whether it is a personal vehicle (true) or not (false). For any other type of vehicle, it defaults to false.\n\nFor example:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,281],"elapsed":2.125251955,"_type":"aimessage"}]
