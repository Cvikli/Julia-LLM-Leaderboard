All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia solution using multiple dispatch and abstract type definition to solve your problem:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    return false\nend\n\nispersonal(::Car) = true\nispersonal(::Motorcycle) = true\n```\nIn this code, `ispersonal` function is overloaded for Car and Motorcycle types to return true. For all other subtypes of AbstractVehicle (like Bus or Truck), it defaults to false. This way, you can add more subtypes of AbstractVehicle in the future if needed and they will automatically be handled by this default case.","status":200,"tokens":[0,207],"elapsed":1.553161081,"_type":"aimessage"}]
