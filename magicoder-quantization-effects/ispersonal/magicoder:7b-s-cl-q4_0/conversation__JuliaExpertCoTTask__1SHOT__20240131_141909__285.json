All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is a simple implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if vehicle isa Car || vehicle isa Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif vehicle isa Bus || vehicle isa Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, we define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle`. Then we have four struct types `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus` and `Truck`. Each of these is a subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. \n\nThe function `ispersonal(vehicle::T)` is generic over the type parameter `T<:AbstractVehicle` which means it can accept any subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. We then use Julia's `isa` operator to check if the provided vehicle is a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`, returning true for these types. For `Bus` and `Truck`, we return false, as those are not personal vehicles. If the type of the vehicle does not match any of these, the function defaults to returning false.\n\nFor example:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[260,353],"elapsed":6.972865267,"_type":"aimessage"}]
