The function `ispersonal` then simply checks the `isPersonal` field of the provided object to return it. \n\nFor example:\n\n```julia\nmy_car = Car(true)\nprint(ispersonal(my_car)) # Outputs: true\n\nmy_bus = Bus(false)\nprint(ispersonal(my_bus)) # Outputs: false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,244],"elapsed":1.82977282,"_type":"aimessage"}]
