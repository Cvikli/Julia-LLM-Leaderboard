All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia solution for your problem:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T == Car || T == Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T == Bus || T == Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, we define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and four types of vehicles: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. We then define a function `ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}` that takes in the type of a vehicle. If the type is either `Car` or `Motorcycle`, it returns `true`; if the type is either `Bus` or `Truck`, it returns `false`. For any other subtype, it defaults to returning `false`.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(typeof(Car))\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,354],"elapsed":2.661856124,"_type":"aimessage"}]
