All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation in Julia:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T === Car || T === Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T === Bus || T === Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\nIn the above code, we have defined an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and four subtypes: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. The function `ispersonal` checks if a given vehicle is of type `Car` or `Motorcycle` by using the `where` keyword to specify that the input should be an instance of one of these types. For other types, it returns false.","status":200,"tokens":[0,231],"elapsed":1.735792872,"_type":"aimessage"}]
