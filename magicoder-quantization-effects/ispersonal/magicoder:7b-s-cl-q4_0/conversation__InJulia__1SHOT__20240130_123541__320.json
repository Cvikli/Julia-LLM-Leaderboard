Then, we provide the `ispersonal` function to return a trait if the provided vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. We use a conditional (if-else) statement to check which of Car or Motorcycle returns true, and Bus or Truck return false. All other subtypes of AbstractVehicle return false by default.","status":200,"tokens":[112,354],"elapsed":2.722891816,"_type":"aimessage"}]
