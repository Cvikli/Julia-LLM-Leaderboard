All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The function `ispersonal` takes a vehicle of any subtype as input and checks its type. If the type is `Car` or `Motorcycle`, it returns true. Otherwise, if the type is `Bus` or `Truck`, it returns false. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, it defaults to returning false.\n\nFor example:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(AbstractVehicle())\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,329],"elapsed":2.493412792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
