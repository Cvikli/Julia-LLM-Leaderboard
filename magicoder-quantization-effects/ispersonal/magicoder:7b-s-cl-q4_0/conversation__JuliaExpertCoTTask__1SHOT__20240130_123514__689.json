All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, the default behavior is that the function returns false (`false` by default in Julia).","status":200,"tokens":[0,225],"elapsed":1.711435431,"_type":"aimessage"}]
