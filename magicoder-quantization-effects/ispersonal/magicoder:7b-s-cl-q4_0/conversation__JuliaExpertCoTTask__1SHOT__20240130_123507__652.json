The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Then I create four struct types `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus` and `Truck` that are all subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`. \n\nThe function `ispersonal` is then defined to take an input `vehicle` of any type that is a subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. It uses the `isa` operator to check whether the vehicle's type is either `Car` or `Motorcycle`, and if it is, it returns `true`. If the vehicle's type is `Bus` or `Truck`, it returns `false`. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, it defaults to returning `false`.\n\nExample: \n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,378],"elapsed":2.891544769,"_type":"aimessage"}]
