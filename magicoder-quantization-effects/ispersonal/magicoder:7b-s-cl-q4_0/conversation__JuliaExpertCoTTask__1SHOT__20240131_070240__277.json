All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The function `ispersonal(vehicle::T)` checks if the provided vehicle is a subtype of `AbstractVehicle` and returns true or false accordingly. If the vehicle type does not match any of the specific types, it defaults to returning false.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,269],"elapsed":2.042550722,"_type":"aimessage"}]
