All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia solution for your problem:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T == Car || T == Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T == Bus || T == Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this code, we define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and four subtypes: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. We then define a function `ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}` that checks the input type `T` against the four defined types. If `T` is either `Car` or `Motorcycle`, it returns true, otherwise (if `T` is neither `Car` nor `Motorcycle`), it defaults to false.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use this function:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(AbstractVehicle) # this will return false, because AbstractVehicle is not a subtype of Car or Motorcycle.\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,378],"elapsed":2.834587984,"_type":"aimessage"}]
