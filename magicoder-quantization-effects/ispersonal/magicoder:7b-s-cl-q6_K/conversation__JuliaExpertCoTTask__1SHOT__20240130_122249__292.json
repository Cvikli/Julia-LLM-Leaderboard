Then we define our `ispersonal` function that checks the type of the provided vehicle. If it is either a Car or Motorcycle, it returns true; if it's a Bus or Truck, false; otherwise (for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle), it defaults to returning false.","status":200,"tokens":[0,277],"elapsed":2.734624706,"_type":"aimessage"}]
