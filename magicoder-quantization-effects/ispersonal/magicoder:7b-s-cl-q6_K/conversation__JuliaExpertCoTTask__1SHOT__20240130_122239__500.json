All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

For all other subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`, it defaults to returning false. \n\nTo test this function, you can use:\n```julia\nispersonal(Car()) # Expected output: true\nispersonal(Motorcycle()) # Expected output: true\nispersonal(Bus()) # Expected output: false\nispersonal(Truck()) # Expected output: false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,284],"elapsed":2.796801015,"_type":"aimessage"}]
