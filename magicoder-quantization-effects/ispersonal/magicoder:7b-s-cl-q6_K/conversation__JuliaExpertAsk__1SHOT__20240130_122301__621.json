All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can define this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nabstract type PersonalVehicle <: AbstractVehicle end\nabstract type NonPersonalVehicle <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: PersonalVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: PersonalVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: NonPersonalVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: NonPersonalVehicle end\n\nispersonal(vehicle::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle} =\n    (T <: PersonalVehicle) ? true : false\n```\nThis function uses abstract types to define the traits of different types of vehicles. The `PersonalVehicle` and `NonPersonalVehicle` are subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`, which in turn is a supertype of all kinds of vehicles. \n\nIn the function `ispersonal(vehicle::T)`, we use the `where {T<:AbstractVehicle}` syntax to specify that the input argument is expected to be some subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. The body of this function checks whether the input type `T` is a subtype of `PersonalVehicle`, and returns true if it is. Otherwise, it returns false.\n\nHere is an example usage:\n```julia\njulia> Car() |> ispersonal  # Returns: true\ntrue\n\njulia> Bus() |> ispersonal  # Returns: false\nfalse\n\njulia> Truck() |> ispersonal  # Returns: false\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,365],"elapsed":3.590594944,"_type":"aimessage"}]
