All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

We then check if it's a subtype of Car, Motorcycle, Bus or Truck using `haskey`. If it is one of these types we return true for car and motorcycles and false for buses and trucks. If the vehicle type isn't in our dictionary, we return false as default behavior for any other type of AbstractVehicle.\n\nFor instance, \n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(AbstractVehicle)\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[260,363],"elapsed":5.71931853,"_type":"aimessage"}]
