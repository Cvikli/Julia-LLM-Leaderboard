All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you might implement such a function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T === Car || T === Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T === Bus || T === Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses Julia's multiple dispatch feature to check the type of `T`. If it is a subtype of `Car` or `Motorcycle`, it returns true. If it is a subtype of `Bus` or `Truck`, it returns false. For any other subtype, it defaults to returning false.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car)) # Outputs: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle)) # Outputs: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus)) # Outputs: false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck)) # Outputs: false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,281],"elapsed":2.698087063,"_type":"aimessage"}]
