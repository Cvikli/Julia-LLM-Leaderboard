Then we define four structs `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. These are all subtypes of the `Vehicle` abstract type. The function `ispersonal(v::T)` is a method that takes in an instance of any subtype `T` of the `Vehicle` type, checks if it's either a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`, and returns true if so; if not, checks if it's either a `Bus` or a `Truck`, returning false if so. For any other subtype of `Vehicle`, the function defaults to returning false.","status":200,"tokens":[0,318],"elapsed":3.116182142,"_type":"aimessage"}]
