All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can define this function in Julia:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nfunction ispersonal(v::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if typeof(v) in [Car, Motorcycle]\n        return true\n    elseif typeof(v) in [Bus, Truck]\n        return false\n    else \n        return false # Default value when the type is not known\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function works by using a `where` clause to specify that it's defined for types that are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Inside the function, it uses the `typeof(v)` function to determine the runtime type of the provided variable v and returns true or false accordingly based on this check.","status":200,"tokens":[0,218],"elapsed":2.134045771,"_type":"aimessage"}]
