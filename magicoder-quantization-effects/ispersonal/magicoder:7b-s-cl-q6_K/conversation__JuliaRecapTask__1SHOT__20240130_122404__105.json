[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Each subtype has a name and body which defines its specific characteristics (in this case, it doesn't have any).\n3. We use the `where` clause to specify that our function should only be applicable for types that are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. The function checks if the provided Type is in the tuple `(Car, Motorcycle)`. \n4. If the input is not a subtype of AbstractVehicle (i.e., it's of type Any), we return false.\n\nNow let's test our function:\n```julia\n@assert(ispersonal(Car) == true)  # Car should be considered personal\n@assert(ispersonal(Motorcycle) == true)  # Motorcycle should be considered personal\n@assert(ispersonal(Bus) == false)   # Bus should not be considered personal\n@assert(ispersonal(Truck) == false)   # Truck should not be considered personal\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,435],"elapsed":4.386141638,"_type":"aimessage"}]
