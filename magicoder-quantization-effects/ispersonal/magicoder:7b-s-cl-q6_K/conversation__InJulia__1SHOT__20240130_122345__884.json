The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can define this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(v::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T == Car || T == Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T == Bus || T == Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\nIn the above code, we define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and four specific vehicle types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, and Truck. The function `ispersonal(v::T)` checks if a vehicle is of type Car or Motorcycle to return true (meaning personal), otherwise it returns false. If the input is not one of these four types, the function defaults to returning false.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car()))  # Output: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus()))  # Output: false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck()))  # Output: false\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle()))  # Output: true\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,298],"elapsed":2.900594508,"_type":"aimessage"}]
