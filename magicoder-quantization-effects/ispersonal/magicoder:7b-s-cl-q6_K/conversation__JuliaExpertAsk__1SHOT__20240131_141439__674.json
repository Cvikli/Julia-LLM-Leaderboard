All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution in Julia programming language:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Bus}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{Truck}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{<:AbstractVehicle}) = false  # default value for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle\n```\nIn this code, the function `ispersonal` is defined to take a type as an argument and return a boolean indicating whether it's a personal vehicle or not. The function uses method overloading in Julia to differentiate between different types. If the input type is not explicitly handled by any of these methods, the default case is used (where `::Type{<:AbstractVehicle}` matches all subtypes of AbstractVehicle).\n\nYou can test this function with some examples:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(SubtypeOfAbstractVehicle)  # assuming SubtypeOfAbstractVehicle is a subtype of AbstractVehicle\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,362],"elapsed":3.476232129,"_type":"aimessage"}]
