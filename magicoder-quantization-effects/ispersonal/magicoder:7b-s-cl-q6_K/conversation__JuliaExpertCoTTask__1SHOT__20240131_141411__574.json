All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

We then define a function `ispersonal` for each of these types, with the latter two returning `false`. For all other types of vehicles (which are instances of `AbstractVehicle`), we provide a default implementation that returns `true`.\n\nThe function can be tested using an example:\n\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(AnyOtherVehicleType())  # returns default implementation\ntrue\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,303],"elapsed":2.923579506,"_type":"aimessage"}]
