The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

We then define a function `ispersonal` that takes a type as input. If the type is either `Car` or `Motorcycle`, it returns true, otherwise it returns false. \n\nWe use `::Type{T}` to denote the type of the argument, and `<:AbstractVehicle` to denote that T must be a subtype of AbstractVehicle. The `where {T<:AbstractVehicle}` part is a constraint on the generic function that says \"for all types T, T must be a subtype of AbstractVehicle\".\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,327],"elapsed":3.156604877,"_type":"aimessage"}]
