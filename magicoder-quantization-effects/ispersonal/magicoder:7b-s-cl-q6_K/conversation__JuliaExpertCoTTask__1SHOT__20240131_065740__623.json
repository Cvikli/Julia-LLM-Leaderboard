We then define a function `ispersonal(vehicle::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}` that takes in any subtype of `AbstractVehicle` and returns true if the vehicle is a car or motorcycle, false otherwise.\n\nFor example, when we call `ispersonal(Car())`, it will return `true`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,253],"elapsed":2.429334298,"_type":"aimessage"}]
