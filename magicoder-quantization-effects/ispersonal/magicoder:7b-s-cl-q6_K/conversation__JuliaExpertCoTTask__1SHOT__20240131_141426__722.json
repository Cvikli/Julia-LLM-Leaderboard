All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

It checks if the provided vehicle type matches either Car or Motorcycle and returns true. For Bus and Truck, it returns false as they are not typically used for everyday driving. If the vehicle type does not match any of these cases (meaning it's some other subtype), it defaults to returning false.\n\nHere is an example usage:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(AbstractVehicle)  # This will return false as it's not a subtype of AbstractVehicle\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,349],"elapsed":3.372302322,"_type":"aimessage"}]
