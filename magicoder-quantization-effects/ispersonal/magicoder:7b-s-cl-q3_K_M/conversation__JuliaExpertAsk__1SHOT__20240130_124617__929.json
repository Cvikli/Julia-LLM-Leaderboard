All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

This function is defined using parametric polymorphism (also known as multimethod dispatch), where the type of the argument determines which version of the function to call. We have defined the function for types Car and Motorcycle, and by default, it will return false for any other subtype of `Vehicle`.","status":200,"tokens":[142,338],"elapsed":2.668904484,"_type":"aimessage"}]
