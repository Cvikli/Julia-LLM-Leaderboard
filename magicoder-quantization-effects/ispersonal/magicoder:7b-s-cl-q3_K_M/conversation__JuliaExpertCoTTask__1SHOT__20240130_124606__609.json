All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

For each of these vehicle types, it defines a function `ispersonal()` to determine if the given vehicle is personal. The Car and Motorcycle return true, while Bus and Truck return false by default because they are not defined for that case in the functions.\n\nWe then test our `ispersonal` function with instances of each Vehicle type to make sure it returns the expected values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,344],"elapsed":2.619074016,"_type":"aimessage"}]
