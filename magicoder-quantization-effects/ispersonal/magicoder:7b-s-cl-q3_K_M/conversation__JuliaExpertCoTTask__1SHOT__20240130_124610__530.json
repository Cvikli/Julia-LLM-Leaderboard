The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

It then defines a function `ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)` that uses type assertion (`vehicle isa`) to check the type of the input and returns either true or false depending on whether it's a personal vehicle (Car or Motorcycle) or not (Bus or Truck). If the input is neither Car nor Motorcycle, it defaults to false.","status":200,"tokens":[0,291],"elapsed":2.214033865,"_type":"aimessage"}]
