The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\n# Define the Car and Motorcycle types that are subtypes of AbstractVehicle\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\n\n# Define the Bus and Truck types that are subtypes of AbstractVehicle \nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(v::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if (T === Car || T === Motorcycle)\n        return true\n    elseif (T === Bus || T === Truck)\n        return false\n    else \n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this solution, we define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` first. Then we define the subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`, namely `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. In the function `ispersonal()`, it checks whether the provided vehicle type is either a `Car` or a `Motorcycle` (which are personal vehicles), and if it is, the function returns true. If the provided type is neither of these, but instead a `Bus` or `Truck`, the function returns false. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, the function defaults to returning false.\n\nWe can check the output with the following example:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,390],"elapsed":3.003417142,"_type":"aimessage"}]
