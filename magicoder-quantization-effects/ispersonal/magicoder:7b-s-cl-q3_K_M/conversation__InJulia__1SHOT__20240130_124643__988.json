All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia program that satisfies your conditions:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nabstract type PersonalVehicle <: AbstractVehicle end\nabstract type NonPersonalVehicle <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: PersonalVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: PersonalVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: NonPersonalVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: NonPersonalVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::Type{<:AbstractVehicle}) \n    if vehicle <: Car || vehicle <: Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif vehicle <: Bus || vehicle <: Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\nThis program first defines abstract types `AbstractVehicle` and their subtypes `PersonalVehicle` and `NonPersonalVehicle`. It then creates specific types `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck` that inherit from these abstract types. \n\nThe function `ispersonal(vehicle::Type{<:AbstractVehicle})` checks if the given vehicle type is a subtype of either `Car` or `Motorcycle`. If true, it returns `true`, else if the vehicle type is a subtype of `Bus` or `Truck`, it returns `false`. If neither of these conditions are met for some reason (maybe due to a typo or other mistake), it defaults to returning `false`.\n\nAn example usage would be: \n```julia\njulia> Car <: AbstractVehicle\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> Bus <: AbstractVehicle\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[112,411],"elapsed":3.196202379,"_type":"aimessage"}]
