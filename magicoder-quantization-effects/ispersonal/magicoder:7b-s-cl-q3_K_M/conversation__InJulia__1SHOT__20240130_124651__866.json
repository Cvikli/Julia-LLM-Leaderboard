All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here's a possible implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if vehicle == Car || vehicle == Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif vehicle == Bus || vehicle == Truck \n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn the example above, `ispersonal` is a function that takes a type (`vehicle::Type{T}`) as its argument. It checks whether the provided type `T` belongs to either `Car` or `Motorcycle`, if so it returns `true`. If the type `T` belongs to either `Bus` or `Truck`, it returns `false`. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, the function defaults to returning `false`.\n\nFor example, let's test our function:\n```julia\n@show ispersonal(Car)  # outputs true\n@show ispersonal(Motorcycle)  # outputs true\n@show ispersonal(Bus)  # outputs false\n@show ispersonal(Truck)  # outputs false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,319],"elapsed":2.44927322,"_type":"aimessage"}]
