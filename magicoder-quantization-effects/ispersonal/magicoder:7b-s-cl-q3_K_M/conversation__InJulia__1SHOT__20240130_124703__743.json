The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

We then define the function `ispersonal`, which takes a vehicle of type Vehicle as input and returns true if it's either a car or motorcycle (which are generally considered personal vehicles for daily driving) and false otherwise. If the input is not one of these types, we return false by default.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\njulia> v1 = Car()\nCar()\n\njulia> ispersonal(v1)\ntrue\n\njulia> v2 = Truck()\nTruck()\n\njulia> ispersonal(v2)\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,300],"elapsed":2.300167552,"_type":"aimessage"}]
