All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia solution:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end \nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end \nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end  \nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    if vehicle isa Car || vehicle isa Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif vehicle isa Bus || vehicle isa Truck\n        return false\n    else \n        return false # default value for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle\n    end\nend\n```\nThis solution defines an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and then four specific types, Car, Motorcycle, Bus, and Truck. It then defines a function `ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)` that returns true if the provided vehicle is of type Car or Motorcycle, false if it's of type Bus or Truck, and defaults to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.\n\nYou can test this code with:\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car()))   # returns true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle()))  # returns true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus()))    # returns false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck()))   # returns false\nprintln(ispersonal(Van()))     # returns false, because Van is not defined\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,328],"elapsed":2.522694113,"_type":"aimessage"}]
