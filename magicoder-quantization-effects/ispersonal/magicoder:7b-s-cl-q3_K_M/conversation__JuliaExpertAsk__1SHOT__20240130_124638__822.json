All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle} = true\nispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{Truck}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{Bus}) = false\n```\n\nThis code defines an abstract type `AbstractVehicle`, and then four specific types `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus` and `Truck`. The function `ispersonal` returns `true` if the input type is either a subtype of `Car` or `Motorcycle` or `Truck`; otherwise, it returns `false`.\n\nHere's an example:\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car))        # Output: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle))  # Output: false\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus))         # Output: false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck))       # Output: false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,285],"elapsed":2.189204097,"_type":"aimessage"}]
