All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia solution using abstract and concrete type hierarchy. We define Vehicle as the supertype, and we define Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck as its subtypes:\n\n```julia\nabstract Vehicle end  # define an abstract type\n\n# Define each of the vehicle types\nstruct Car <: Vehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: Vehicle end\nstruct Bus <: Vehicle end\nstruct Truck <: Vehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::Vehicle) :: Bool\n    return vehicle in (Car, Motorcycle) ? true : false  # return true if it's a Car or Motorcycle, otherwise false.\nend\n```\n\nThis function checks whether the provided Vehicle type is either a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`. If so, it returns `true`, and for any other subtype of `Vehicle`, it defaults to returning `false`. \n\nFor example, you can test the function using:\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car()))   # prints true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle()))   # prints true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus()))   # prints false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck()))  # prints false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,287],"elapsed":2.204376208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
