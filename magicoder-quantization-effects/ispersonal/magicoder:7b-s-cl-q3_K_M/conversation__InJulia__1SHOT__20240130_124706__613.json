All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you might write such a function in Julia programming language:\n\n```julia\nabstract Vehicle <: AbstractVehicle end\nabstract Car <: Vehicle end; \nabstract Motorcycle <: Vehicle end; \nabstract Bus <: Vehicle end; \nabstract Truck <: Vehicle end; \n\nispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true;\nispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = true;\nispersonal(::Type{Bus}) = false;\nispersonal(::Type{Truck}) = false;\nispersonal(::Any) = false;\n\n# Example\nprintln(\"Is the Car a personal vehicle? \", ispersonal(Car)) # Should print: Is the Car a personal vehicle? true\n```\nIn this example, we first define `Vehicle` as an abstract supertype and then each of `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus` and `Truck` are defined as subtypes. We also provide a catch-all method for any type not explicitly mentioned to return false, which means they're not personal vehicles. \n\nWhen we call `ispersonal(::Type{Car})` or `ispersonal(Car)`, it returns true because Car is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. Similar logic applies to Motorcycle, Bus and Truck. For any other type (which includes subtypes that are not defined explicitly), it defaults to false.","status":200,"tokens":[0,325],"elapsed":2.500502197,"_type":"aimessage"}]
