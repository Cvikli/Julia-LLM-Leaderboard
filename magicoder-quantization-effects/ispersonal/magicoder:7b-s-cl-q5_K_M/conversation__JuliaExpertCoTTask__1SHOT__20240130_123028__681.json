The `ispersonal` function checks whether the given vehicle is an instance of Car or Motorcycle, which it classifies as personal vehicles for everyday driving, while instances of Bus and Truck are not. If the type does not match any of these cases, it defaults to false.","status":200,"tokens":[0,278],"elapsed":2.461676587,"_type":"aimessage"}]
