All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here's a simple implementation in Julia:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T === Car || T === Motorcycle\n        return true \n    elseif T === Bus || T === Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false # default case for any other subtype\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this code, we first define the abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and then several concrete types that are subtypes of it. Then we define a function `ispersonal`, which takes an instance of some subtype of AbstractVehicle as argument and returns true if the vehicle is a car or motorcycle (which are commonly used for personal driving), false if the vehicle is a bus or truck (usually not used for personal driving). If the provided type does not match any of these cases, it returns false.\n\nHere's an example:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(typeof(42)) # a type that is not a subtype of AbstractVehicle\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,361],"elapsed":3.226151078,"_type":"aimessage"}]
