All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a solution in Julia that defines this function:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Car)\n    true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Motorcycle)\n    true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Bus)\n    false\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Truck)\n    false\nend\n```\nThis code defines an `ispersonal` function that returns whether a given vehicle type (`Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, or `Truck`) represents a personal vehicle. The `true` values correspond to personal vehicles, while the `false` values correspond to non-personal ones. This is done by defining separate functions for each of these types that return the appropriate boolean value.\n\nExample:\n```julia\nispersonal(Car())  # true\nispersonal(Motorcycle())  # true\nispersonal(Bus())  # false\nispersonal(Truck())  # false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,273],"elapsed":2.401634845,"_type":"aimessage"}]
