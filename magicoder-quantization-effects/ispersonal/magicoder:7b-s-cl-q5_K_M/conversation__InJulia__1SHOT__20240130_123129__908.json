All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

If you're asking for a method to determine the type of vehicle, that's quite simple:\n```julia\nabstract AbstractVehicle\ntype Car <: AbstractVehicle end\ntype Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\ntype Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\ntype Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(v::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T == Car || T == Motorcycle \n        return true\n    elseif T == Bus || T == Truck \n        return false\n    else \n        return false # default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle\n    end\nend\n```\nYou can test this function with the following code:\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car()))     # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle()))  # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus()))       # false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck()))      # false\nprintln(ispersonal(Int))          # false (default)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,272],"elapsed":2.4317768,"_type":"aimessage"}]
