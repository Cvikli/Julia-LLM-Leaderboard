All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

We define three types of vehicles: Car and Motorcycle which are subtypes of AbstractVehicle and Bus and Truck which are not. For these two types of Vehicles, it returns true. For any other Vehicle (which is a subtype of Vehicle but not AbstractVehicle), it returns false.\n\nYou can call this function with some instances to test its behavior:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(AbstractVehicle)  # This will return false because AbstractVehicle is a type, not an instance of a Vehicle.\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,347],"elapsed":3.091746979,"_type":"aimessage"}]
