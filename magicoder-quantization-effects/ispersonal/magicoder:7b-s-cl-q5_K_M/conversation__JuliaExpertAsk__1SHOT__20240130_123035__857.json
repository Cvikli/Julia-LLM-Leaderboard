All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here is one way you could define this in Julia:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nfunction ispersonal(v::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T == Car || T == Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T == Bus || T == Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function works by pattern matching on the type parameter `T` of the vehicle. If `T` is a subtype of `Car` or `Motorcycle`, it returns true, indicating that this vehicle is a personal vehicle. If `T` is a subtype of `Bus` or `Truck`, it returns false, indicating that this vehicle is not a personal vehicle for everyday driving (since buses and trucks are typically used for commercial purposes). For any other type of vehicle, it defaults to returning false as well.\n\nYou could use the function like so:\n```julia\njulia> Car() |> ispersonal  # This should return true\ntrue\n\njulia> Motorcycle() |> ispersonal  # This should also return true\ntrue\n\njulia> Bus() |> ispersonal  # This should return false\nfalse\n\njulia> Truck() |> ispersonal  # This should also return false\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[142,358],"elapsed":3.220182024,"_type":"aimessage"}]
