It then defines a function `ispersonal` that returns true if the provided vehicle type is either a Car or a Motorcycle (i.e., it's a personal vehicle), false if it's a Bus or Truck (i.e., it's not a personal vehicle). The default behavior of the function, which is to return false for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, is also defined at the end.","status":200,"tokens":[0,382],"elapsed":3.11049021,"_type":"aimessage"}]
