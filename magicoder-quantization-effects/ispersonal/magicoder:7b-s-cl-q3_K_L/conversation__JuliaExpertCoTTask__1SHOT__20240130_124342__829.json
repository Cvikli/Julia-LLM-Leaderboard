All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The function `ispersonal` is defined to return true for types `Car` and `Motorcycle`, and false for types `Bus` and `Truck`. Any other type of `AbstractVehicle` will default to returning false.\n\nFor example:\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car)) # prints: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus)) # prints: false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,273],"elapsed":2.200530291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
