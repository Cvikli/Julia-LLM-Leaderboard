All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this task by creating a Julia function with nested conditional statements to handle each type of vehicle:\n\n```julia\nabstract Vehicle end\n\nmutable struct Car <: Vehicle end \nmutable struct Motorcycle <: Vehicle end\nmutable struct Bus <: Vehicle end\nmutable struct Truck <: Vehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(v::Vehicle)\n    if typeof(v) == Car || typeof(v) == Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif  typeof(v) == Bus || typeof(v) == Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n\n# Example\ncar = Car()\nmotorcycle = Motorcycle()\nbus = Bus()\ntruck = Truck()\nprintln(ispersonal(car)) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(motorcycle)) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(bus)) # false\nprintln(ispersonal(truck)) # false\n```\nThis function works by checking the type of the Vehicle object passed to it. If the type is a Car or Motorcycle, it returns true; if it's a Bus or Truck, it returns false. For any other types of Vehicles, it defaults to returning false.","status":200,"tokens":[0,286],"elapsed":2.307171349,"_type":"aimessage"}]
