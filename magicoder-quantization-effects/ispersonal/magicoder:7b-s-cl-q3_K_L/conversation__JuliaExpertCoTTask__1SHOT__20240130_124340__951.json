All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The function `ispersonal` returns true if its argument is either a Car or a Motorcycle (both subtypes of AbstractVehicle), otherwise it returns false. \n\nWe use the `println` function to print out the result of calling `ispersonal`. Note that we pass instances of each type to `ispersonal` and print whether each call returns true or false.","status":200,"tokens":[0,318],"elapsed":2.570421037,"_type":"aimessage"}]
