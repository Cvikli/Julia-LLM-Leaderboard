All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution in Julia programming language:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(v::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T == Car || T == Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T == Bus || T == Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n\n# Testing the function\nprintln(ispersonal(Car)) # Should print: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle)) # Should print: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus)) # Should print: false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck)) # Should print: false\n```\nIn the above code, we first define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and then four types of vehicles: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. We then declare a function `ispersonal(v::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}` that takes in a Type parameter `T`. \n\nIf the type `T` is either Car or Motorcycle, it returns true; if it's either Bus or Truck, it returns false. For any other subtype of AbstractVehicle, it defaults to returning false by using `else`. Finally, we test our function with instances of each vehicle type and print the results.","status":200,"tokens":[0,343],"elapsed":2.799096237,"_type":"aimessage"}]
