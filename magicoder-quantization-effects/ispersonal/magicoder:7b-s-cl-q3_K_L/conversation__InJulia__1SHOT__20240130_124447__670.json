All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can define a function using `function`. Here's how you could define your `ispersonal` function:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(v::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle} \n    if T == Car || T == Motorcycle \n        return true\n    elseif T == Bus || T == Truck \n        return false\n    else \n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by pattern matching the provided vehicle type `v` to a concrete subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. If `v` matches one of the defined types (Car or Motorcycle), it returns true. If `v` matches either Bus or Truck, it returns false. For any other subtype of AbstractVehicle, it defaults to returning false.\n\nYou can call this function with an instance of a specific vehicle type like so:\n```julia\nc = Car() \nm = Motorcycle() \nb = Bus()\nt = Truck() \nprintln(ispersonal(c)) # prints true\nprintln(ispersonal(m)) # prints true\nprintln(ispersonal(b)) # prints false\nprintln(ispersonal(t)) # prints false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,331],"elapsed":2.674871244,"_type":"aimessage"}]
