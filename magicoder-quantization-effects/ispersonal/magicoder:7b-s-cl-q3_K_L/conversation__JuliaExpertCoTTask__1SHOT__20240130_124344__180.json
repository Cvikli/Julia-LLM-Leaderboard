All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The `ispersonal` function checks for which types this method is defined and returns the respective value, defaulting to false for any other type.","status":200,"tokens":[0,243],"elapsed":1.95819206,"_type":"aimessage"}]
