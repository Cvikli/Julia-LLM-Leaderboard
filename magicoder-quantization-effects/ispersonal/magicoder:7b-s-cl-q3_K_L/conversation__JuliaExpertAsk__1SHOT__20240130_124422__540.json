All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia solution for the problem:\n\n```julia\nabstract Vehicle end\nmutable struct Car <: Vehicle; end\nmutable struct Motorcycle <: Vehicle; end\nmutable struct Bus <: Vehicle; end\nmutable struct Truck <: Vehicle; end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::T) where {T<:Vehicle}\n    if T === Car || T === Motorcycle \n        return true\n    elseif T === Bus || T === Truck \n        return false\n    else \n        return false\n    end\nend\n\n# example usage\njulia> ispersonal(Car()) # returns true\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus()) # returns false\nfalse\n```\n\nIn this code, we first define an abstract type `Vehicle` and then concrete types `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. The function `ispersonal()` takes in a vehicle of any subtype of Vehicle and checks if it's either a Car or Motorcycle. If true, the function returns true; for Bus and Truck, the function returns false by default (since they are not typically used for personal daily driving).\n  \nThe function uses pattern matching to determine what type is being passed into it. The `where {T<:Vehicle}` portion of the function definition is a constraint that ensures that `T` will only be evaluated as true if `T` is indeed a subtype of Vehicle.","status":200,"tokens":[0,342],"elapsed":2.753182178,"_type":"aimessage"}]
