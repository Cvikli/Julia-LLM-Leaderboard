If it's not, it defaults to returning `false`.\n\nNote that the above definition assumes you have defined Bus and Truck as separate subtypes of AbstractVehicle. If they were not defined elsewhere in your code, then defining them like this would be necessary.","status":200,"tokens":[0,330],"elapsed":2.833207346,"_type":"aimessage"}]
