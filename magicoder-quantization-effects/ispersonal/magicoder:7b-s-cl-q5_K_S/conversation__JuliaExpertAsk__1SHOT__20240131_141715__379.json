All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

If it's either Car or Motorcycle, it returns true; if it's either Bus or Truck, it returns false. For any other subtype of AbstractVehicle, it also returns false by default.\n\nHere is an example:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(AbstractVehicle)  # For any other subtype of AbstractVehicle, it returns false by default.\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,308],"elapsed":2.619595562,"_type":"aimessage"}]
