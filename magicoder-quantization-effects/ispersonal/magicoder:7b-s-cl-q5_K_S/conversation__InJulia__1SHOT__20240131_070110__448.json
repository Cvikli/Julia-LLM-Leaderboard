If the provided Vehicle type is not Car or Motorcycle, it will default to `false`. For types Bus and Truck, it returns `false` as they are not typically used for everyday driving. \n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(AbstractVehicle) # Default value for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,305],"elapsed":2.575741104,"_type":"aimessage"}]
