All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Each vehicle type has a corresponding function `ispersonal(::VehicleType)`, which returns true or false based on the type of vehicle. The default case for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle is handled by the last line.\n\nFor example, if we call `ispersonal(Car())`, it will return true, because a Car is a personal vehicle. If we call `ispersonal(Truck())`, it will return false, because a Truck is not typically used for everyday driving.","status":200,"tokens":[0,301],"elapsed":2.568561377,"_type":"aimessage"}]
