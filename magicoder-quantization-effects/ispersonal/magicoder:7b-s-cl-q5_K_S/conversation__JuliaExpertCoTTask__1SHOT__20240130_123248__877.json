All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

It checks if this is a Car or a Motorcycle and returns true or false accordingly. If the provided type `T` is not one of `Car` or `Motorcycle`, it defaults to returning false (as specified by the `where {T<:AbstractVehicle}` clause).\n\nFor example, `ispersonal(Car())` would return `true`, as would `ispersonal(Motorcycle())`. But `ispersonal(Bus())` and `ispersonal(Truck())` would each return `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,248],"elapsed":2.16355406,"_type":"aimessage"}]
