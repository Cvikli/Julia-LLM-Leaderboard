All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia solution for your problem:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T <: Car || T <: Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T <: Bus || T <: Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\n\nHere, we define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and then four concrete types `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. We then define a function `ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}` that takes in a type `T` as its argument.\n\nInside the function, we use the `<:` operator to check if `T` is a subtype of `Car` or `Motorcycle`, and if so, return true. If not, we then check if `T` is a subtype of `Bus` or `Truck, and if so, return false.\n\nIf `T` does not match any of the above cases, it defaults to returning false.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(AbstractVehicle)\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,383],"elapsed":3.262734921,"_type":"aimessage"}]
