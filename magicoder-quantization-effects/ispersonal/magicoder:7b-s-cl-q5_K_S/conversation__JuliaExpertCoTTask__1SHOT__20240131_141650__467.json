The function `ispersonal(v::T)` where `T<:AbstractVehicle` returns true for `Car` and `Motorcycle` and false for `Bus` and `Truck` (i.e., personal vehicles) by pattern matching on the input type `T`. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, it defaults to returning false.\n\nExample:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,295],"elapsed":2.520420535,"_type":"aimessage"}]
