If it's not one of these, but instead a Bus or Truck, the function returns false. For any other type of Vehicle, the default return value is also false.\n\nHere's an example usage: \n```julia\ncar = Car()\nmotorcycle = Motorcycle()\nbus = Bus()\ntruck = Truck()\n\nprintln(ispersonal(car)) # prints true\nprintln(ispersonal(motorcycle)) # prints true\nprintln(ispersonal(bus)) # prints false\nprintln(ispersonal(truck)) # prints false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,355],"elapsed":3.008902952,"_type":"aimessage"}]
