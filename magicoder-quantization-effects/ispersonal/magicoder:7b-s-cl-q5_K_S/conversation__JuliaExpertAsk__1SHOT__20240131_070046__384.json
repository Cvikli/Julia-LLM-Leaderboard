The function `ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}` checks if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. It returns true for Car and Motorcycle, false for Bus and Truck, and defaults to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. \n\nFor example, `ispersonal(Car)` would return `true`, `ispersonal(Truck)` would return `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,273],"elapsed":2.311219813,"_type":"aimessage"}]
