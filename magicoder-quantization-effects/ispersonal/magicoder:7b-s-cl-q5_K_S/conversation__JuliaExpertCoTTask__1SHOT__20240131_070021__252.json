We then define the function `ispersonal` that returns a trait based on the provided Vehicle type. The function is overloaded for each of these types, returning true or false as required. For any other subtype of AbstractVehicle, it defaults to false.\n\nLet's test our function with an example:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,265],"elapsed":2.268707815,"_type":"aimessage"}]
