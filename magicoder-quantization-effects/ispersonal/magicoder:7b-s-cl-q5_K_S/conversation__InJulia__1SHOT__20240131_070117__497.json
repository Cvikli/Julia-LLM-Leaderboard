It works for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, and Truck. For Car and Motorcycle it returns true, indicating that they are personal vehicles. For Bus and Truck it returns false, as they are not typically used for daily driving. For any other subtype of AbstractVehicle, the function defaults to returning false.\n\nExample:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bicycle)  # Bicycle is not a subtype of AbstractVehicle, so it defaults to false.\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,337],"elapsed":2.851704571,"_type":"aimessage"}]
