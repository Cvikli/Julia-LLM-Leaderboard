For `Bus` and `Truck`, it returns `false`. Any other types of `AbstractVehicle` will return `false` by default.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(AbstractVehicle)  # This will return false, as it's not a subtype of Car or Motorcycle.\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,320],"elapsed":2.713011618,"_type":"aimessage"}]
