All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia solution that defines the `ispersonal` function:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Bus}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{Truck}) = false\n\nispersonal(vehicle_type::Type{<:AbstractVehicle}) = false\n```\nIn the above code, we define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and four concrete types `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. We then define a function `ispersonal` for each of these types that returns whether they are personal vehicles. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, the default implementation returns false.\n\nHere is an example usage:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(typeof(Car))  # This will return false, as it's not a concrete type\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,338],"elapsed":2.877604727,"_type":"aimessage"}]
