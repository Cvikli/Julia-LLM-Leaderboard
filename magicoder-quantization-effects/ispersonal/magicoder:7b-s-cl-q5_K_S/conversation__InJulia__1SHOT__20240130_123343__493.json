The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

For example:\n\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car))       # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle)) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus))        # false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck))      # false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,226],"elapsed":1.909775657,"_type":"aimessage"}]
