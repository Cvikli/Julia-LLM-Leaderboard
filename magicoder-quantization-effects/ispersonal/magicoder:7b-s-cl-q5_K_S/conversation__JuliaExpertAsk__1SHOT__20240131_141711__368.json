All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia solution using abstract and concrete types:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if vehicle isa Car || vehicle isa Motorcycle \n        return true\n    elseif vehicle isa Bus || vehicle isa Truck \n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\n\nYou can test the function using:\n\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car())) # returns: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle())) # returns: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus())) # returns: false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck())) # returns: false\nprintln(ispersonal(AbstractVehicle())) # returns: false (default)\n```\n\nThis function `ispersonal` checks if the given vehicle is either a Car or a Motorcycle, and returns true. If it's not one of those types but is a Bus or Truck, it returns false. For any other type of AbstractVehicle, it defaults to returning false.","status":200,"tokens":[142,303],"elapsed":2.605459875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
