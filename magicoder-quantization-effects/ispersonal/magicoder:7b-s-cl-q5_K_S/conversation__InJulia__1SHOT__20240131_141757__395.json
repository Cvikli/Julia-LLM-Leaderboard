It uses the `where` keyword to specify that `T` must be a subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. Depending on what type `T` actually is (Car, Motorcycle, Bus or Truck), it returns true if it's a Car or Motorcycle and false if it's a Bus or Truck. For any other subtype of AbstractVehicle, it defaults to returning false.\n\nFor example:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(VehicleSubtypeYouDidntThinkOf())\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,336],"elapsed":2.845543199,"_type":"aimessage"}]
