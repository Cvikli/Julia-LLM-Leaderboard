All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The `Val` is constructed such that it's true if the input subtype of Car or Motorcycle, and false otherwise. Then, we check this function using assert statements at the end to make sure it works as expected for the provided types.","status":200,"tokens":[0,242],"elapsed":2.113750906,"_type":"aimessage"}]
