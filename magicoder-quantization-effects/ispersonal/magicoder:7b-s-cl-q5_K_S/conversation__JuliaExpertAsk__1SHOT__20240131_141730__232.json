All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

If it is, it returns true. Otherwise, it checks if the type is a subtype of Bus or Truck and returns false in that case. For any other types, it defaults to returning false.","status":200,"tokens":[0,318],"elapsed":2.699110367,"_type":"aimessage"}]
