All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution in Julia programming language:\n```julia\nabstract Vehicle end\n\nmutable struct Car <: Vehicle end\nmutable struct Motorcycle <: Vehicle end\nmutable struct Bus <: Vehicle end\nmutable struct Truck <: Vehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:Vehicle}\n    if T == Car || T == Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T == Bus || T == Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\nIn the above code, `ispersonal` function is defined to take a type parameter `T`. The function checks if `T` is either `Car` or `Motorcycle`, and returns `true` in such case. If `T` is neither of these but is either `Bus` or `Truck`, it returns `false`. For any other subtype of `Vehicle`, the function defaults to returning `false`.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Vehicle)\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,297],"elapsed":2.520971654,"_type":"aimessage"}]
