All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution in Julia programming language:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Car})\n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle})\n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Bus})\n    return false\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Truck})\n    return false\nend\n\nispersonal(::Type{T}) where T <: AbstractVehicle = false\n```\nIn this code, we first define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and then four concrete types: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. Each of these types is a subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.\n\nWe then define the function `ispersonal(::Type{T}) where T <: AbstractVehicle = false` as the default case. This will return `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, which we have not explicitly defined to be personal vehicles.\n\nFinally, we define two functions `ispersonal(::Type{Car})` and `ispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle})` that each return `true`. These are the cases where the vehicle is a car or motorcycle, which are both types of personal vehicles for everyday driving.\n\nThe function `ispersonal(::Type{Bus})` and `ispersonal(::Type{Truck})` each return `false`, since buses and trucks are not typically considered to be personal vehicles for everyday driving.","status":200,"tokens":[0,406],"elapsed":3.459001284,"_type":"aimessage"}]
