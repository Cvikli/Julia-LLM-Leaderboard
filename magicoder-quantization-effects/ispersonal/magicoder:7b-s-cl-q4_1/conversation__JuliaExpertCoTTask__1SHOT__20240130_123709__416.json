All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

We then implement a function `ispersonal` for each of these subtypes, returning true if they are personal vehicles (Car and Motorcycle) and false otherwise (Bus and Truck).\n\nYou can test the functionality with \n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car())) # prints: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle())) # prints: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus())) # prints: false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck())) # prints: false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,277],"elapsed":2.234319063,"_type":"aimessage"}]
