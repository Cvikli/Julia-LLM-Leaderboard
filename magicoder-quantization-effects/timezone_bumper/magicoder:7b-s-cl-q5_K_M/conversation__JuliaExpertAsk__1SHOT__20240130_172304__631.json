The default value for the bump parameter is set to 3 hours. Inside the function, it first checks if the input type is DateTime and throws an error if it's not. Finally, it uses the `+` operator with the Hour(bump) to increase the DateTime by the specified number of hours.","status":200,"tokens":[0,172],"elapsed":1.495898356,"_type":"aimessage"}]
