The second argument is `bump`, but if it's not specified, it defaults to 3.\n\nWe then return the result of adding `bump` hours to `dt`.\n\nIf you try to call this function with a Date object (like `Date(2021, 1, 1)`), instead of a DateTime, an error will be thrown because our function is not defined for dates. This is done by using a catch block that checks if the error was due to calling a nonexistent method (`MethodError`). If it was, we print out a helpful message indicating the type of error and what went wrong.","status":200,"tokens":[0,308],"elapsed":2.686345069,"_type":"aimessage"}]
