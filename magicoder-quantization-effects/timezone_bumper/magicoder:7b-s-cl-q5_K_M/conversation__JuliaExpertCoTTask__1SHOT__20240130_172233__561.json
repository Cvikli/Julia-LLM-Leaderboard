If the bump argument is not provided, it defaults to 3 hours. It first checks if the input is of type `Date`. If it is, it throws an error as the function needs a DateTime value (a specific point in time with date, month, year, and time components).\n\nIf the input is indeed a DateTime object, it adds the bumped amount of hours to the original time. \n\nTesting this function:\n```julia\n@test timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3) == DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 15, 0)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,253],"elapsed":2.271600639,"_type":"aimessage"}]
