It checks whether the input is of type `Date`. If it is, it throws an error message stating that only `DateTime` can be used. If it's not, it adds the specified number of hours to the datetime and returns the result.\n\nWhen we call this function with a date:\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(Date(2023, 4, 10))\n```\nThis will throw an error saying `Date type cannot be used, please use DateTime`.\n\nWhen we call it with a datetime:\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)\n```\nIt will correctly bump the time by 3 hours.","status":200,"tokens":[244,276],"elapsed":25.370668438,"_type":"aimessage"}]
