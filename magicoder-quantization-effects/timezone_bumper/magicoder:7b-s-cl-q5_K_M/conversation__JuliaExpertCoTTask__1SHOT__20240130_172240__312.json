[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

Instead it's $dt.\")\n    else\n        return dt + Hour(bump)\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this code:\n- We import the `Dates` package for handling date and time operations in Julia.\n- The function `timezone_bumber(dt::DateTime, bump=3)` takes two arguments. The first argument is a DateTime object and the second one is an optional integer representing the number of hours to add to the timestamp (defaults to 3).\n- Inside the function we use the type assertion operator (`::`) to check if `dt` is of type `DateTime`. If it's not, then it throws an error with a custom message. If `dt` is indeed a DateTime object, then it adds the number of hours specified by `bump` to that timestamp using the `+` operator and `Hour` type from `Dates` package.\n- Finally we return the updated timestamp.","status":200,"tokens":[0,264],"elapsed":2.32582277,"_type":"aimessage"}]
