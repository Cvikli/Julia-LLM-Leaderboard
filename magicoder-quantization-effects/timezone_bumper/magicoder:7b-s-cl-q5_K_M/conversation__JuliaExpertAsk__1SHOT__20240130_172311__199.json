If `bump` is not provided, it defaults to 3. \n\nThe function first checks if the input type of `dt` matches `DateTime`. If not, it throws an error with a descriptive message. \n\nIf `dt` is confirmed as a `DateTime`, it simply adds the number of hours specified by `bump` (defaults to 3) to the timestamp and returns the new time.","status":200,"tokens":[0,205],"elapsed":1.7879625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
