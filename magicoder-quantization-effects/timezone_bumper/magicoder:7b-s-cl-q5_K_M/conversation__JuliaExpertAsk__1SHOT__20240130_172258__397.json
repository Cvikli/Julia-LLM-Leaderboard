By default, it adds 3 hours. If no `bump` is specified, it uses 3 as its default value. \n\nThen, it defines another function `timezone_bumper(date::Date)`. This version of the function throws an error when invoked with a `Date` type argument (since this operation doesn't make sense for dates), which prevents the code from running if a `Date` is passed in.","status":200,"tokens":[0,203],"elapsed":1.770443234,"_type":"aimessage"}]
