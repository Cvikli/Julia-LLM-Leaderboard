[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function in Julia that achieves the required task:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nThis function takes a DateTime type argument, and an optional integer bump (defaulted to 3). It then returns the datetime after being bumped by the given hours. If any other types are passed as an argument, a method error will be thrown indicating that there is no method matching `timezone_bumper` with arguments of type `T`.\n\nTo use this function you can call it like so:\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(\"2021-06-15T13:30\")  # example datetime\nbump = 4                             # bump by four hours\nnew_date = timezone_bumper(dt, bump)  # apply the function to get the new date time\n```\nPlease replace `\"2021-06-15T13:30\"` and `4` with your desired inputs.","status":200,"tokens":[0,246],"elapsed":1.98367181,"_type":"aimessage"}]
