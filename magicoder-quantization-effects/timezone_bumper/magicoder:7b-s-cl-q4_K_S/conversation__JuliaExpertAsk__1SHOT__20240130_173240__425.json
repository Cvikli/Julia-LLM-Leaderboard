Provide a DateTime value.\"))\nend\n```\nThis function will work with `DateTime` types and throws an error for `Date` types. It adds or subtracts the given number of hours from a date time object. The argument bump defaults to 3 but it can be changed by passing the desired hour value as an additional argument when calling the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,214],"elapsed":1.649815251,"_type":"aimessage"}]
