Here we are using the `DateTime` type check provided by Julia (`typeof(dt) != DateTime`), and if it's not of this type an error message is thrown. If the input is correct, then it increases the hour accordingly and returns the modified datetime object. \n\nNow you can call this function with a DateTime argument along with the desired bump value:\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,218],"elapsed":1.690690075,"_type":"aimessage"}]
