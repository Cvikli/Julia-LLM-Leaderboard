[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, the built-in package `Dates` provides all necessary functionality for working with dates and times. Below is a function that accomplishes what you asked:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Testing the function\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(\"2019-07-01T01:00\"))\n```\nIn this code, `Hour` is a unit of time defined in Dates package, and `+` operator is overloaded for DateTime and Hour types to perform addition. Note that default value of `bump` is 3 hours. If you want different bump value, you can provide it when calling the function like this: `timezone_bumper(DateTime(\"2019-07-01T01:00\"),5)`.\n\nThis function will throw an error if any Date type is provided instead of DateTime. Here's how to ensure that:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Union{Date,DateTime}; bump::Int=3)\n    # Throw an error when a Date is passed\n    if dt isa Date\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Only DateTime type supported. You provided: $dt\"))\n    end\n\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nIn the updated function, it checks whether the input `dt` is of type `Date`. If yes, it throws an error, else it increases the timestamp by the given number of hours.","status":200,"tokens":[0,361],"elapsed":2.86969319,"_type":"aimessage"}]
