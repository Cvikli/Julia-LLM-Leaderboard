We also accept an optional keyword argument, `bump`. If no value for `bump` is provided when calling the function, it defaults to 3 hours (Hour(3)). \n\nThe function increases the DateTime by adding the number of Hours specified by bump and returns the result.\n\nNote: We're using Dates.now() as a sample datetime for demonstration. In practice you can provide your own datetime.","status":200,"tokens":[0,209],"elapsed":1.602985361,"_type":"aimessage"}]
