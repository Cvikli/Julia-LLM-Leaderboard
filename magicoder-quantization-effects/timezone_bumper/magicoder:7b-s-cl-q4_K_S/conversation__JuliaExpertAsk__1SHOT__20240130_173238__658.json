If an argument of type Date is passed to the function, it throws an ArgumentError stating that \"The argument provided is not a DateTime type.\" \n\nYou can customize the bump value by passing it as a second argument like so:\n```julia\njulia> timezone_bumper(dt, 1)\n2022-11-04T14:57:19.944+02:00\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,316],"elapsed":2.449322444,"_type":"aimessage"}]
