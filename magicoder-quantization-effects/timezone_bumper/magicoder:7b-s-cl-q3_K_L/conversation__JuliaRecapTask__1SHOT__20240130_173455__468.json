[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia function as per your request:\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump=3) \n    if typeof(dt) == DateTime\n        return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\n    elseif typeof(dt) == Date\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"The function should only work with DateTime types. Provided argument is of type $(typeof(dt))\"))\n    else\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Provided argument is not a DateTime or Date type.\"))\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function takes in two arguments: `dt` (DateTime), and an optional third argument `bump`. The function checks if the provided `dt` object is of type DateTime, then it increases it by `bump` hours. If a Date type is passed as the first argument, it throws an error specifying the type of argument that was expected instead. \n\nPlease note that Dates in Julia are not timezone-aware. This function won't change the timezone of your DateTime object because DateTime type doesn't store timezone information. It just represents a point in time relative to `1970-01-01T00:00:00Z`. \n\nThis is an example usage:\n```julia\ndt = now(Dates.UTC) # get the current date and time in UTC timezone\nbump_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, 3) # increase dt by 3 hours\nprintln(bump_dt) # output the new DateTime object\n```","status":200,"tokens":[373,340],"elapsed":2.923968869,"_type":"aimessage"}]
