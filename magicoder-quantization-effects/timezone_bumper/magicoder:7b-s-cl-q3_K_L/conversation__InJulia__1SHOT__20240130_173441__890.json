Provided type is Date\"))\n    else\n        return dt + Hour(bump)\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this solution, we first import the Dates module from Julia's standard library, which provides functions and macros for working with date-time values in Julia. Then, we define a function `timezone_bumper` that takes a DateTime as an argument (with a default bump value of 3), and checks if the provided argument is actually a DateTime type. If it's not, it throws an error with a descriptive message. Otherwise, it returns a new DateTime object which is the original datetime increased by `bump` hours.","status":200,"tokens":[0,208],"elapsed":1.681591297,"_type":"aimessage"}]
