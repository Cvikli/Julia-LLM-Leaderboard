If it's not, an error is thrown. Then it returns the date and time increased by `bump` hours. \n\nNow let's test this function with your example:\n\n```julia\n@test timezone_bumber(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3) == DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 15)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,200],"elapsed":1.606222488,"_type":"aimessage"}]
