[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

If you want to make sure the returned DateTime object is strictly later than the input, you could modify the function like so:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump::Int=3)\n    # check if dt is DateTime type, otherwise throw an error\n    if !isa(dt, DateTime) \n        throw(ErrorException(\"Provided argument must be of DateTime type.\"))\n    end\n    \n    # increase the time by bump hours and return the new datetime\n    bumped_time = dt + Hour(bump)\n\n    # check if the bumped_time is strictly greater than dt \n    if bumped_time <= dt\n        throw(ErrorException(\"The returned DateTime must be strictly later than the input.\"))\n    end\n    \n    return bumped_time\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,421],"elapsed":3.506841083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
