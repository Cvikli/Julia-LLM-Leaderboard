If it's not, an error will be thrown. After this check, it adds `bump` hours to the time component of the date-time object and returns a new `DateTime` object with the same date but the adjusted time. \n\nYou can test this function as follows:\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(\"2021-10-30T08:00:00\")\nbump_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, 5)\nprint(bump_dt) # output: 2021-10-30T13:00:00\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,287],"elapsed":2.319733673,"_type":"aimessage"}]
