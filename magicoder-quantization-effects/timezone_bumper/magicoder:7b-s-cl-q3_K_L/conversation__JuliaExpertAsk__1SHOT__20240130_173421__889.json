If no argument is provided, it will use the current system time as input. If a different `dt` value is supplied, it checks whether this `dt` is of type `Date`, if so, it throws an error. Otherwise, it adds the number of hours specified by `bump` to `dt`. \n\nThe function will return a new DateTime object that represents the updated time.","status":200,"tokens":[0,186],"elapsed":1.504154679,"_type":"aimessage"}]
