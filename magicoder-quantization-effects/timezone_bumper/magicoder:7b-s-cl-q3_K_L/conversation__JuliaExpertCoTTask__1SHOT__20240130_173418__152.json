The function checks if the input is of type `DateTime`, if it's not, it throws an error. Then it adds the bump hours to the datetime. Here is how you can do it in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump = 3)\n    dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date)\n    error(\"This function does not work with Date types\")\nend\n```\nIn the code above, `Hour(bump)` is used to add hours to a `DateTime`. The default value of `bump` in the function is set as 3. If you pass a `Date` type object into this function, it will throw an error saying \"This function does not work with Date types\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,207],"elapsed":1.668180309,"_type":"aimessage"}]
