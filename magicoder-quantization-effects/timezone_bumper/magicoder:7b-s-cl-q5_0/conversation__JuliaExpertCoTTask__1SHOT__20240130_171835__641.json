Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

When you call `dt + bump`, the overloaded function takes the current hour of `dt` adds `bump` hours to it, and returns a new DateTime object. If no bump value is provided, it defaults to 3 hours.\n\nIf we try to use this on a Date type instead of DateTime, Julia will throw an error:\n\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(Date(2023,4,10)) # throws error\n```\nThis function won't work with Date types because we overloaded the + operator specifically for DateTime. The function `timezone_bumper()` checks the type of its first argument and raises an error if it is not a DateTime.","status":200,"tokens":[0,292],"elapsed":2.5134019,"_type":"aimessage"}]
