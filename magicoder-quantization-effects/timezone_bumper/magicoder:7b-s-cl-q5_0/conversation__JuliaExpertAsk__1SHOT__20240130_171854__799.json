The `DateTime` type is a basic building block of Date and Time functionality in Julia. \n\nIf you give an argument of different type than DateTime then it throws ArgumentError indicating that it works only for DateTime types.\n\nFinally, I've used the `+` operator to add hours (represented by `Hour`) to the date-time object.","status":200,"tokens":[0,188],"elapsed":1.610025329,"_type":"aimessage"}]
