By default, if no value for bump is provided (i.e., when you call timezone_bumper(dt)), it will increase the timestamp by 3 hours.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that you are using the \"UTC+3\" timezone and does not consider daylight saving time adjustments. If you want to use a different timezone, you'll have to manually add or subtract the necessary hour from your local timezone to UTC+3.","status":200,"tokens":[0,211],"elapsed":1.802142959,"_type":"aimessage"}]
