If it isn't, an error is thrown. Otherwise, the DateTime `dt` gets bumped by `bump` hours (defaults to +3) using Julia's built-in Dates module. The function then returns the bumped DateTime.\n\nHere is how you would call this function with your provided example:\n```julia\nbumped_time = timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)\nprintln(bumped_time) # Outputs: 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,303],"elapsed":2.615874247,"_type":"aimessage"}]
