[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, we can define our function like this:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump::Int=3)\n    if typeof(dt) !== DateTime\n        error(\"This function only accepts DateTime type input.\")\n    end\n    \n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nIn this code, `Hour` is a time unit in Julia's Dates and Times module. The function takes a DateTime object (`dt`) as the argument and an optional parameter `bump`, which defaults to 3 if not provided. It checks that `dt` is indeed of type DateTime, otherwise throws an error. Then, it increases `dt` by the specified number of hours using the `+` operator and the `Hour` time unit.\n\nNote: If you want to increase a date by a certain amount of hours, you could use the following code:\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(d::Date; bump::Int=3)\n    if typeof(d) !== Date\n        error(\"This function only accepts Date type input.\")\n    end\n    \n    return d + Hour(bump)\nend\n``` \nThis code works in the same way, but it increases a date by a certain amount of hours. The time will not be maintained because dates do not have any concept of time.","status":200,"tokens":[0,301],"elapsed":2.636876449,"_type":"aimessage"}]
