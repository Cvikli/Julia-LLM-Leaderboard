[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is a simple function that does the required task in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump::Int = 3)\n    if typeof(dt) == Date\n        throw(ErrorException(\"Cannot operate on a Date type. Please, provide DateTime.\"))\n    else\n        return dt + Hour(bump)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn this function `timezone_bumper`, it first checks whether the provided argument is of `DateTime` type and then either increases the date by `bump` hours or throws an exception if it's not a DateTime. The bumping operation uses the built-in `Hour` time unit which adds/subtracts the given number of hours from a specific point in time.\n\nYou can call this function with different inputs:\n```julia\ndt1 = now() # gets current datetime\nprintln(timezone_bumper(dt1)) # bumps by default 3 hours\n\ndt2 = Date(2022,7,15) # a date\ntry\n    println(timezone_bumper(dt2))\ncatch e\n    println(e.msg) # prints error message\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[11,280],"elapsed":2.471322854,"_type":"aimessage"}]
