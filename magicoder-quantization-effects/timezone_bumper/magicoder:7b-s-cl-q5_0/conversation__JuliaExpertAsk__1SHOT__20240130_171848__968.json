It also has an optional keyword argument `bump` which defaults to 3. Inside the function we first check if `dt` is of type Date, if it is then an exception is thrown with the message \"Input must be a DateTime, not a Date\". If `dt` is indeed a DateTime, we simply return `dt + Hour(bump)` where `Hour(bump)` is equivalent to adding bump hours to the time.\n\nYou can test this function as follows:\n\n```julia\nt = now() # Get current date and time\nbumped_time = timezone_bumper(t) \nprintln(\"Bumped Time: \", bumped_time)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,268],"elapsed":2.289098293,"_type":"aimessage"}]
