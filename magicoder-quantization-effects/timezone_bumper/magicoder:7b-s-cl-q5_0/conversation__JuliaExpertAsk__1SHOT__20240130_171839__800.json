If it's not, it throws an error. Then it increases the timestamp by the number of hours specified in `bump`.\n\nIf you want to test this function:\n\n```julia\ndt = Dates.DateTime(2021, 1, 1, 9, 0) # Example timestamp\nprintln(\"Original DateTime: \", dt)\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt)\nprintln(\"Bumped DateTime: \", bumped_dt)\n```\nThis will print the original and bumped timestamps.","status":200,"tokens":[103,265],"elapsed":2.296555518,"_type":"aimessage"}]
