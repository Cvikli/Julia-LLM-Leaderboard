Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)\n    if typeof(dt) == Date\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Date type is not supported. Only DateTime type is allowed.\"))\n    end\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nThis function checks whether the input `dt` is a `DateTime` or `Date` type. If it's a `Date`, an error is thrown, as we can't manipulate time with dates only. If `dt` is of `DateTime` type, it adds `bump` number of hours to the timestamp.\n\nYou can use this function by calling it like:\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(\"2019-08-03T10:45:00\")) # returns \"2019-08-03T13:45:00\"\n```\n\nNote that this will increase the timestamp by exactly `bump` hours, regardless of daylight savings or other time zone changes. If you want to keep the timestamp within a specific timezone (e.g., UTC), you might need to use something like `ZonedDateTime`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,281],"elapsed":2.553789089,"_type":"aimessage"}]
