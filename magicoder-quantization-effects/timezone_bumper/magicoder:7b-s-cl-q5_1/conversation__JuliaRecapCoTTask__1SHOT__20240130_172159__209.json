[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the function `timezone_bumper`:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)\n    if typeof(dt) != DateTime\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be DateTime type\"))\n    end\n    dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nThis function takes a `DateTime` object as input and increases it by the specified number of hours. It checks that the provided argument is of type `DateTime`. If it's not, an error is thrown.\n\nIf there are any special instructions to be followed while writing this function, they can be written inside the function body or passed as arguments:\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3, instruction=\"do nothing\")\n    if typeof(dt) != DateTime\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be DateTime type\"))\n    end\n    \n    # Instruction can be any valid Julia code\n    if instruction == \"double the time\" \n        dt + Hour(2*bump)\n    elseif instruction == \"add a week\" \n        dt + Week(1)\n    else\n        dt + Hour(bump)\n    end\nend\n```\nFor example, if you want to double the time, you would call `timezone_bumper(dt, instruction=\"double the time\")`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,313],"elapsed":2.868220487,"_type":"aimessage"}]
