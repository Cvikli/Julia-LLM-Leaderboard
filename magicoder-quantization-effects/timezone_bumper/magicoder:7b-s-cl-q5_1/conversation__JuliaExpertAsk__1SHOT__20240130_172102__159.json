If any other type of object is passed or if Date types are not accepted then it throws a MethodError or TypeError respectively.\n\nIn this case, we're testing with a DateTime \"2022-01-01T12:00:00\" and then calling the function without passing an argument to check for a MethodError (when no arguments are passed). If we call it with an invalid input type like String or Number, it would catch that as a TypeError.","status":200,"tokens":[0,290],"elapsed":2.594530988,"_type":"aimessage"}]
