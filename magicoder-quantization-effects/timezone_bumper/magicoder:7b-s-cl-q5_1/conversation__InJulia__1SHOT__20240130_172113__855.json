By default, it will increase by 3 hours if no explicit bump is provided. If a date is passed instead of a datetime, an error is thrown as per the requirement. This function uses the `Dates` package from Julia standard library to manipulate dates and datetimes.","status":200,"tokens":[0,163],"elapsed":1.447199459,"_type":"aimessage"}]
