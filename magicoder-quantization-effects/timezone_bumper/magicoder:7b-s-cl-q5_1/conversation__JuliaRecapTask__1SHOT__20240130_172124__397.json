[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

Below is a solution for your task:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump::Int=3)\n    if typeof(dt) != DateTime\n        throw(ErrorException(\"The provided argument must be of type DateTime.\"))\n    end\n\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nYou can call the function by providing a `DateTime` object and optionally a bump value:\n\n```julia\ndt = now()\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, 2) # Adds two hours to dt.\nprintln(bumped_dt)\n```\n\nThis function uses the built-in `now()` function from Dates.jl package to get the current date and time. Then it calls the `timezone_bumper` function with this `DateTime` object, adding 2 hours to it. The result is printed out on the screen.","status":200,"tokens":[373,239],"elapsed":2.217652754,"_type":"aimessage"}]
