[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia code solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump::Int=3)\n    if typeof(dt) != DateTime\n        throw(ErrorException(\"Input must be of type DateTime\"))\n    end\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nThe function `timezone_bumper` accepts a DateTime object and an optional bump argument which defaults to 3. It first checks if the input is indeed a DateTime, throwing an exception otherwise. Then it simply adds the specified number of hours (defaulting to 3) to the provided date-time object.\n\nYou can call this function with your example like so:\n\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)\nbump_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, 3)\nprintln(bump_dt)  # Outputs: 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,238],"elapsed":2.140716772,"_type":"aimessage"}]
