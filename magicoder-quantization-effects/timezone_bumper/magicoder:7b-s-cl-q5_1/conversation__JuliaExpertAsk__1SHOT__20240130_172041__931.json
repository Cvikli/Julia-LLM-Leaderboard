If it's not, then we throw an ArgumentError saying that only DateTime types are accepted. \n\nIf `dt` is indeed a DateTime object, we simply return `dt + Hour(bump)`, which increases the date by the amount specified by `bump`. Here `Hour` is a type from Dates module in Julia standard library.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n```julia\ndt = now() # Get current DateTime\nprintln(timezone_bumper(dt)) # Prints the timestamp 3 hours ahead of the current time\n```","status":200,"tokens":[103,230],"elapsed":2.104442479,"_type":"aimessage"}]
