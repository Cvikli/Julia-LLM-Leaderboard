Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can use the built-in `DateTime` functions to achieve this. The function will also need to handle a default value for `bump`. Below is a simple implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump = 3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Testing the function\ndateTime = DateTime(\"2022-12-31T12:00:00\")\nbumpedTime = timezone_bumper(dateTime) # Should return \"2022-12-31T15:00:00\"\n```\n\nThis function accepts a DateTime object and an optional bump value. If the user does not provide a bump value, it defaults to 3 hours. It uses the `+` operator for addition of time spans (hours in this case), which returns a new DateTime. Note that Date types will automatically be converted to DateTime types when doing arithmetic operations.\n\nAlso remember to always handle potential errors and exceptions in your code! In this example, we do not have any error handling code; if the user provides a non-DateTime input, the function will crash with an error.","status":200,"tokens":[0,269],"elapsed":2.397260996,"_type":"aimessage"}]
