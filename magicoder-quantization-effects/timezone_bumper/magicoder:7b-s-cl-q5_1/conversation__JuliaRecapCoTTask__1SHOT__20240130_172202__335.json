[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

Below is a sample code that fulfills all requirements:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)\n    # Check if dt is Date (not DateTime), throw an error\n    if isa(dt,Date)\n        error(\"Input should be a DateTime, not a Date.\")\n    end\n    \n    # Add hours to the DateTime and return it\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `using Dates` is used to import the `Dates` library which contains types and methods for dealing with dates and times.\n  \n- We define the function `timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)` where we check if dt is of type Date or DateTime, if it's a date an error is thrown. \n\n- If it's a DateTime, then we add 'bump' hours to it and return the new datetime. \n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(2022,1,2,14) # A DateTime object\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(dt) # It will increase the dt by default +3 hours\n```\n\nOr you can specify bump hours as an argument:\n\n```julia\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, 5) # It will increase the dt by 5 hours\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,363],"elapsed":3.350110104,"_type":"aimessage"}]
