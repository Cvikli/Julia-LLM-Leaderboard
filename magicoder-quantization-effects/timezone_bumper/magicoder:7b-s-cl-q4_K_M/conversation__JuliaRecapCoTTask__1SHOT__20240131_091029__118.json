[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

If the second argument is not provided, it defaults to 3 hours. It then returns a new `DateTime` that has been shifted forward by the amount specified in `bump`.\n\nThe function also checks if the input type is DateTime or Date. If it's not, it throws an error. This is done using a try-catch block. The error is caught and checked whether it's of MethodError type which means that the method for the provided types doesn't exist. In such cases, it prints out an appropriate message.","status":200,"tokens":[0,258],"elapsed":2.129882121,"_type":"aimessage"}]
