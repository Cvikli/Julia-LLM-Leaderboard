If it's not, an error is thrown. Otherwise, it adds the given number of hours to the date-time object and returns the result. The default value for `bump` is set to 3.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n```julia\njulia> timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)\n2023-04-10T15:00:00\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,215],"elapsed":1.719042935,"_type":"aimessage"}]
