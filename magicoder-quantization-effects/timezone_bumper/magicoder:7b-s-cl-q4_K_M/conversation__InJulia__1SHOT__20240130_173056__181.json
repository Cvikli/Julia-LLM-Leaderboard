It also has a keyword argument, `bump`, which defaults to 3 hours. The function checks if `dt` is of type DateTime, and throws an error if it's not. If `dt` is of type DateTime, it adds `bump` number of hours to the date and time.\n\nHere is how you could use this function:\n```julia\ndt = now()  # get current datetime\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt)  # bump by default 3 hours\nbumped_5_dt = timezone_bumper(dt,5)  # bump by 5 hours\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,232],"elapsed":1.84912314,"_type":"aimessage"}]
