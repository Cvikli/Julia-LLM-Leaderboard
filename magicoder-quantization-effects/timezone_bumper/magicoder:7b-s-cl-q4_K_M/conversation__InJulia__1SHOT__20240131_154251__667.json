We first import the Dates module which provides many useful functions for dealing with dates and times.\n2. Then we define our function `timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump = 3)`. It accepts a DateTime type as an argument, and increases it by `bump` hours (defaults to +3 if no value is provided).\n3. We then test the function with the current time. If everything goes well, it will print out the bumped timestamp. If not, it will catch the error and print out a helpful message.","status":200,"tokens":[73,300],"elapsed":2.403934479,"_type":"aimessage"}]
