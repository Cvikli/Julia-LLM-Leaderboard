This function takes a DateTime type and an optional Int parameter (defaults to 3).\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n```\n\nInside the function, you will check if the provided argument `dt` is of `DateTime` type. If it's not, then throw an error.\n\n```julia\nif typeof(dt) !== DateTime\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"Provided variable must be a DateTime\"))\nend\n```\nNext, increase the time by `bump` hours using `dt + Hour(bump)`.\n\n```julia\ndt += Hour(bump)\n```\nFinally, return the modified date-time.\n\n```julia\nreturn dt\nend\n```\nThis function works for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types as requested.\n\nYou can test this function using your example:\n\n```julia\njulia> timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)\n2023-04-10T15:00:00\n```\nAs you can see from the output, time has been bumped up by three hours as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[0,351],"elapsed":2.885590301,"_type":"aimessage"}]
