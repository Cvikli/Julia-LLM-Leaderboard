It increases the provided DateTime by a specified number of hours (defaulting to 3). If you try to pass a Date instead, it will throw an error:\n\n```julia\nbump = 3 # We want to increase it by 3 hours\nnew_time = timezone_bumper(Date(\"2022-12-15\"), bump)\n# Outputs: MethodError: no method matching timezone_bumper(::Date, ::Int64)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,266],"elapsed":2.136527744,"_type":"aimessage"}]
