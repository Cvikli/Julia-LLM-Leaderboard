[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function that fulfills the requirements:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)\n    if typeof(dt) != DateTime\n        throw(ErrorException(\"Only DateTime type is accepted.\"))\n    end\n    \n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nThis function accepts a `DateTime` as an argument and returns the same date time, but increased by the amount of hours specified in the `bump` parameter. By default, if no bump is provided it will increase the time by 3 hours. If a different type is passed to this function, it throws an error saying \"Only DateTime type is accepted.\"\n\nThe `Dates` module is used for date and time operations in Julia. The `DateTime` type represents a specific point in time with nanosecond precision. The `Hour(bump)` part of the code increases the time by the specified number of hours.","status":200,"tokens":[0,216],"elapsed":1.75897387,"_type":"aimessage"}]
