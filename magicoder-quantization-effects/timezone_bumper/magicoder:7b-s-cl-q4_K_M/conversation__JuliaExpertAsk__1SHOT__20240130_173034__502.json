Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can write this function in Julia:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Test the function \ndt = now()\nprintln(timezone_bumper(dt))\n```\nThis function takes a DateTime object as input, and then adds `bump` hours to it. If no value is provided for bump (defaults to +3), it uses that. It throws an error when a Date type is used instead of a DateTime type. \n\nIf you want the function to be able to only work with DateTime types but throw errors for any other types, you can modify your function as follows:\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Test the function \ndt = now()\nprintln(timezone_bumper(dt))\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(x)\n    throw(ErrorException(\"Input must be a DateTime type.\"))\nend\n```\nIn this version, `timezone_bumper` will only accept DateTime types. If you try to pass another type (like Int or String), it will throw an exception saying \"Input must be a DateTime type\".","status":200,"tokens":[103,300],"elapsed":2.479936286,"_type":"aimessage"}]
