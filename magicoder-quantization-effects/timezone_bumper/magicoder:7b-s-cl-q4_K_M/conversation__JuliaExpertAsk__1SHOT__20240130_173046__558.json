If `bump` is omitted, it defaults to 3. The function returns the provided datetime plus `bump` hours in seconds (because `DateTime` type and `Second` are defined by the package DataTime.jl).\n\nAnother function with the same name but a different signature throws an error if a date (not a datetime) is passed as its argument. This demonstrates that we can overload methods based on argument types, providing different implementations for each possible type.","status":200,"tokens":[0,226],"elapsed":1.803831858,"_type":"aimessage"}]
