Please use DateTime.\")\nend\n```\nIn the first function `timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)`, we are accepting a DateTime object and an optional Int parameter (defaults to 3). We're then returning the result of adding the bump hours to the datetime.\n\nThe second function `timezone_bumper(dt::Date)` is specifically for Date types. It throws an error when called, stating that we cannot increase time for a Date type. Instead, it should be used with DateTime.","status":200,"tokens":[0,182],"elapsed":1.444805438,"_type":"aimessage"}]
