Here's a function that accomplishes what you're asking:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(date::Date)\n    error(\"Can only add hours to a DateTime type. A Date was provided instead.\")\nend\n```\nIn this code, `DateTime` and `Hour` are types from the Dates library in Julia, which represents date and time values respectively. The function `timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)` takes a DateTime as input and increases it by the amount specified in `bump`. If no argument is provided for `bump`, it defaults to 3 hours.\n\nThe second function, `function timezone_bumper(date::Date)`, checks if you try to pass a Date type to this function and throws an error if so. This is because you can't add hours to a Date type - only DateTime can do that.","status":200,"tokens":[0,248],"elapsed":1.976242489,"_type":"aimessage"}]
