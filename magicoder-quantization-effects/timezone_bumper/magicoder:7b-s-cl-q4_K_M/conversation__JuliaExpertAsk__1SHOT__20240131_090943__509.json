Please provide a DateTime instead of Date.\")\nend\n```\nIn this code:\n- `DateTime` is from the Dates module in Julia, which represents date and time.\n- `Hour` is also from the Dates module, representing a duration of 1 hour.\n- The function `timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump = 3)` takes a DateTime object (`dt`) and an optional integer `bump`. If no `bump` value is provided, it defaults to 3 hours. It then returns the result of adding the duration `Hour(bump)` to `dt`.\n- The function `timezone_bumper(d::Date)` takes a Date object (`d`) and throws an error message if called. This is because this function only works with DateTime types, not Date types.","status":200,"tokens":[0,248],"elapsed":2.003473211,"_type":"aimessage"}]
