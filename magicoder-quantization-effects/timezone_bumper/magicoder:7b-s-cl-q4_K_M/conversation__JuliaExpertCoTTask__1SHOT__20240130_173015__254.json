It will increase the DateTime provided by the given bump hours and throws an error for Date types.\n\n```julia\nfunction TimeZoneBumper(dt::DateTime,bump=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Testing with example date time 2023-4-10 12:00 and bumping by 3 hours.\n@test TimeZoneBumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3) == DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 15, 0)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- We first define a function `TimeZoneBumper` that takes two arguments: `dt::DateTime` and an optional argument `bump=3`.\n- In the body of the function, we return the DateTime object after adding the number of hours specified by `bump`. This is done using the built-in `Hour` function in Julia's Dates module.\n- We then test our function with a specific example to make sure it works as expected. The `@test` macro is used for testing in Julia, and if the test fails an error will be thrown.","status":200,"tokens":[244,297],"elapsed":17.457396141,"_type":"aimessage"}]
