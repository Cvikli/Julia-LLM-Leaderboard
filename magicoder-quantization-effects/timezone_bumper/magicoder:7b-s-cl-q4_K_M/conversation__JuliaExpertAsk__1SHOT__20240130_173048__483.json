If no argument is provided, it defaults to 3. The function will throw an error if any Date type is passed to it.\n\nYou can test this function by calling it with the current time (as obtained from `now()`) as the argument. You should see that the returned timestamp has been moved forward by the specified number of hours.","status":200,"tokens":[0,176],"elapsed":1.406601382,"_type":"aimessage"}]
