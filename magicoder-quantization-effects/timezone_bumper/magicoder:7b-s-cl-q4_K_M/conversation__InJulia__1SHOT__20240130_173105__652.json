The `DateTime` and `Hour` types from this package are used to manipulate timestamps. \nThe function `timezone_bumper` first checks if its input `dt` is of type `DateTime`. If it is not, a MethodError will be thrown as the function cannot handle Date objects. \nIf the input `dt` is indeed a DateTime object, the function increases it by the number of hours specified in `bump`, and then returns the new timestamp.","status":200,"tokens":[0,301],"elapsed":2.402993701,"_type":"aimessage"}]
