If the input is not of type DateTime, it throws an exception. Otherwise, it adds the specified number of hours to the time.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\ntimezone_bumber(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)\n```\nThis will return `2023-04-10T15:00:00` which is the input time plus three hours.","status":200,"tokens":[0,205],"elapsed":2.018764909,"_type":"aimessage"}]
