If the provided argument is indeed a `DateTime`, it adds the number of hours specified by the `bump` parameter to that date and time. The `Hour(bump)` part does this addition operation.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(\"2023-12-25T14:00\")\nbumped_time = timezone_bumper(dt)\nprintln(bumped_time)  # Outputs: 2023-12-25T17:00:00.000\n```","status":200,"tokens":[103,256],"elapsed":2.523877136,"_type":"aimessage"}]
