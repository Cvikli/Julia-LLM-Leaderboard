[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

Please provide a DateTime.\")\n    end\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we first check the type of `dt`. If it's not a DateTime object, we throw an error stating that a DateTime is required. Otherwise, we simply add `bump` hours to the provided DateTime and return the result. \n\nIf you run the function with your example, like so:\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)\n```\nIt will output `2023-04-10T15:00:00`, which is the timestamp increased by three hours.","status":200,"tokens":[0,229],"elapsed":2.219121894,"_type":"aimessage"}]
