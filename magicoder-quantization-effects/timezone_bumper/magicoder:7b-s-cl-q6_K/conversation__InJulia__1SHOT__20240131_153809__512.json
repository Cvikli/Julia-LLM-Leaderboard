If the input is not of DateTime type, it throws an ArgumentError stating that it works only with DateTime types and does not work with Date types. If the input is correct, it returns the DateTime value increased by bump hours. \n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\ndt = now()\nbump_dt = timezone_bumper(dt)\nprint(bump_dt)\n```\nThis will print the current date and time, but with an additional 3 hours added to it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,211],"elapsed":2.016400022,"_type":"aimessage"}]
