It first checks if the input is of type DateTime. If it's not, it throws an error. Otherwise, it returns the date-time object increased by `bump` hours.\n\nYou can test this function with your example:\n```julia\njulia> timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)\n2023-04-10T15:00:00\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,231],"elapsed":2.253232551,"_type":"aimessage"}]
