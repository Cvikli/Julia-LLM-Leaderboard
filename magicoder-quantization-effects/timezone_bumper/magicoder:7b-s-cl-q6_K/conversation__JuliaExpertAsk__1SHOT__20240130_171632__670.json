The function can be written as follows:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)\n    if isa(dt, Date) \n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Function only works with DateTime types\"))\n    else \n        return dt + Hour(bump)\n    end\nend\n```\nThe `timezone_bumper` function takes a DateTime type and an optional keyword argument bump. If the input is not a DateTime, it throws an ArgumentError indicating that it only works with DateTime types. Otherwise, it adds the number of hours specified by the bump argument to the provided datetime.\n\nYou can use this function like:\n```julia\ndt = now() # get current date and time\nbumped_time = timezone_bumper(dt) # bumps by default 3 hours from current time\nbumped_time2 = timezone_bumper(dt, 4) # bumps by 4 hours instead of the default 3\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,246],"elapsed":2.417473667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
