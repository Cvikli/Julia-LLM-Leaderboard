If bump isn't provided, it defaults to 3 hours.\n- In the body of the function, we first check if the input is of Date type. If so, we throw an error using the `throw` function. Otherwise, we return the DateTime plus the number of hours specified by `bump`.\n- The `Hour(bump)` part adds the number of hours specified by `bump` to the date time object.","status":200,"tokens":[0,242],"elapsed":2.367285203,"_type":"aimessage"}]
