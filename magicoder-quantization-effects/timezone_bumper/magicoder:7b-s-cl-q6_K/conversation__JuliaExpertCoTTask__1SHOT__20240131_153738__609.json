If `dt` is actually of type `Date`, an error will be thrown. If `dt` is of type `DateTime`, the function will return the datetime `dt` incremented by `bump` hours.\n\nYou can test this function with your example:\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)\n```\nThis will return `2023-04-10T15:00:00` which is the datetime `2023-04-10 12:00:00` incremented by 3 hours.","status":200,"tokens":[0,257],"elapsed":2.477964089,"_type":"aimessage"}]
