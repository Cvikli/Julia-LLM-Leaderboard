Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can implement the function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)\n    if typeof(dt) == Date\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"This function does not accept Date types.\"))\n    else\n        return dt + Hour(bump)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, we use the `Dates` package to work with date and time. The function `timezone_bumper` takes a DateTime object (`dt`) as an argument, and an optional keyword argument `bump`. If no `bump` is provided, it defaults to 3 hours.\n\nThe function first checks if the type of `dt` is Date. If it is, it throws an ArgumentError stating that this function does not accept Date types.\n\nIf `dt` is a DateTime object, it adds the number of hours specified by `bump` to `dt`. The `Hour(bump)` part converts the integer `bump` into a time interval that can be added to `dt`. \n\nPlease note that this function does not check if `bump` is within the valid range (i.e., between -24 and 24). You might want to add such checks depending on your needs.","status":200,"tokens":[0,289],"elapsed":2.819821659,"_type":"aimessage"}]
