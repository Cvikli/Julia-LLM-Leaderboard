Here's how you can write this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump = 3)\n    if typeof(dt) != DateTime\n        throw(ErrorException(\"Provided argument is not a DateTime type\"))\n    end\n    \n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nThis function accepts a `DateTime` object (`dt`) and an optional argument `bump`. If `bump` isn't provided, it defaults to 3 hours. It first checks if the input is indeed a DateTime type using `typeof(dt)`. If it's not, it throws an exception with an error message saying \"Provided argument is not a DateTime type\".\n\nIf the input is of correct type, the function adds the specified number of hours to the date and time (defaulting to 3). The operation is performed using Julia's `Hour` unit in conjunction with the `+` operator.\n\nYou can call this function like so:\n```julia\ndt = now()\nbump_time = timezone_bumper(dt)\nbump_time_with_3_hours = timezone_bumper(dt, 3)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,280],"elapsed":2.707090737,"_type":"aimessage"}]
