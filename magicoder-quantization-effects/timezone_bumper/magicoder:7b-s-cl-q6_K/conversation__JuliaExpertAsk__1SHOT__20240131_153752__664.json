If no second argument is provided, it defaults to 3 hours. It then returns the original DateTime incremented by the amount of bump hours.\n\nIf you try to pass a Date type to this function, it will throw an error because Dates.DateTime can't be called on types of Date. This is done using `try-catch` block which captures any errors thrown and prints them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,251],"elapsed":2.403606155,"_type":"aimessage"}]
