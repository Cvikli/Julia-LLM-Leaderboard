Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can achieve this in Julia using the built-in datetime and timezone functions from Dates package. Here's how you could do that:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates  # Include Dates Package for working with dates and times\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    if typeof(dt) != DateTime\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be a DateTime type.\"))\n    end\n    \n    dt + Hour(bump)  # Increase the provided timestamp by given number of hours.\nend\n```\nThis function works as follows:\n- It takes two arguments `dt` and `bump`.\n- `dt` is the DateTime object to which you want to bump (increase or decrease) time, and it's required.\n- If `bump` is not provided, a default value of 3 is used.\n- The function checks if the input type of `dt` is indeed a DateTime type. If it isn't, it throws an ArgumentError with a relevant message.\n- Then, it simply adds the `bump` amount to the `dt` and returns the result. This effectively \"bumps\" or adjusts the time in the DateTime object by the specified number of hours.","status":200,"tokens":[0,281],"elapsed":2.7355932,"_type":"aimessage"}]
