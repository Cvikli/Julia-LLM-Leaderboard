[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

Provided type is Date.\")\n    else\n        return dt + Hour(bump)\n    end\nend\n```\nIn the above code:\n- `using Dates` is used to import the package that provides the `DateTime` and `Date` types, which are used in the function.\n- The function `timezone_bumper` takes a DateTime type and an optional Int parameter (defaults to 3).\n- Inside the function, we check if the provided argument is of Date type using `typeof(dt) == Date`. If it is, we throw an error with `error(\"This function only works with DateTime types. Provided type is Date.\")`.\n- If the provided argument is not a Date type (i.e., it's a DateTime), we simply return the datetime increased by bump hours using `dt + Hour(bump)`. The `Hour` function from Dates package is used to add hours to the DateTime object.","status":200,"tokens":[11,263],"elapsed":2.625382407,"_type":"aimessage"}]
