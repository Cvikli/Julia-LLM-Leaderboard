If it's not, then an `ArgumentError` will be thrown. The `Hour(bump)` part increases the DateTime by `bump` hours. \n\nYou can test this function with your example like so:\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)\n```\nThis will return `2023-04-10T15:00:00`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,231],"elapsed":2.263947289,"_type":"aimessage"}]
