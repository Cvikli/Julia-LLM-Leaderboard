If it's not, an ArgumentError is thrown with an appropriate error message. If it is, the function simply adds `bump` hours to the date time and returns the new timestamp. \n\nPlease note that bumping timezone by 3 hours is usually not recommended because it might lead to incorrect results if a daylight saving transition occurs during this period. This solution assumes a naive interpretation of \"timezone\" in the sense that it doesn't account for daylight savings time or other changes in local time zone rules.","status":200,"tokens":[0,203],"elapsed":1.946660688,"_type":"aimessage"}]
