If it's not, an error is thrown. Then, if the check parameter is true (default), we check for overflow when adding `bump` hours to `dt`. If this would result in a year greater than 2087, a warning message is printed instead of throwing an error.\n\nThe function then simply adds `bump` hours to `dt` and returns the new DateTime.","status":200,"tokens":[0,271],"elapsed":2.615063281,"_type":"aimessage"}]
