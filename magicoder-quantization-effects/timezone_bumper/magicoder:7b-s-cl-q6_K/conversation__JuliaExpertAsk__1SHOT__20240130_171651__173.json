Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function which satisfies the above problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)\n    if typeof(dt) == Date\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Only DateTime type is supported. You provided Date type.\"))\n    end\n\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nIn this code, we start with a function named `timezone_bumper` which takes one argument (`dt`) of the DateTime type and another optional argument (`bump`) that defaults to 3. Within the body of the function, we first check if the passed value is actually a Date (i.e., a date without time). If it is, an ArgumentError is thrown with the message \"Only DateTime type is supported. You provided Date type.\"\n\nIf `dt` is indeed a DateTime, we simply add to it the number of hours specified by `bump`. The `Hour` function from Julia's Dates module takes an integer argument and returns a time interval of that many hours.\n\nYou can call this function with either a DateTime object or a bump value like so:\n\n```julia\nt = now()\nnew_time = timezone_bumper(t)  # default bump is +3\nprintln(new_time)\n\n# Calling the function with an explicit bump:\nanother_time = timezone_bumper(t,5)  # bump is +5 hours\nprintln(another_time)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,336],"elapsed":3.272985478,"_type":"aimessage"}]
