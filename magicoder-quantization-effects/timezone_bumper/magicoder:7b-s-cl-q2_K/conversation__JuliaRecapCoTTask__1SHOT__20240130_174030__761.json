[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can use the following code:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump = 3)\n    if typeof(dt) != DateTime\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be a DateTime type\"))\n    end\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nThis function checks the argument `dt` to ensure it's of type `DateTime`. If not, it throws an error. After confirming this, it adds the number of hours specified in `bump` to the date-time. \n\nIf you want to use a specific time zone during the bumping process, you can do something like this:\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump = 3)\n    if typeof(dt) != DateTime\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be a DateTime type\"))\n    end\n    return dt + Hour(bump) - UTC\nend\n```\nThis will adjust the time based on the local timezone and then subtract out any timezone difference.\n\nRemember to add your instructions in between the double-curly braces, replacing {{instructions}} with whatever specific instructions you'd like included.","status":200,"tokens":[0,274],"elapsed":2.133140744,"_type":"aimessage"}]
