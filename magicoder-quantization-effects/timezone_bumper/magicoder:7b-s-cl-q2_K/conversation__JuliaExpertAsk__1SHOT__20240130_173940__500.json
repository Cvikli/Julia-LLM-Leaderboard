Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can implement the `timezone_bumper` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump = 3)\n    if isa(dt, DateTime)\n        return dt + Hour(bump)\n    elseif isa(dt, Date)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"This function works only for DateTime types.\"))\n    else\n        @warn \"The argument seems not a DateTime or Date type. Converting it to a DateTime.\"\n        return datetime2period(dt).start + Hour(bump) \n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, we first check if the input `dt` is of `DateTime` type. If yes, we increase its value by `bump` hours. If it's not a DateTime type and also not a Date type (which would be very unusual), we convert it to a DateTime using the function `datetime2period(dt).start`. We then perform the same operation as before.\n\nRemember that in Julia, the `::` operator is used for specifying types of function arguments and return values. The `elseif` clause is executed only if both conditions from the previous `if` and `elseif` are false. In this case, it will only execute if `dt` is not a DateTime or Date type.","status":200,"tokens":[0,302],"elapsed":2.28225468,"_type":"aimessage"}]
