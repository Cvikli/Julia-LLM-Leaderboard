If it's not, an `ArgumentError` will be thrown with a message indicating that `bump` should be a non-negative integer and `dt` needs to be of type `DateTime`.\n\nIf the time is valid, the function adds `bump` hours to the time using `Dates.Hour(bump)`. \n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\nt = DateTime(\"2022-12-31T12:00:00\") # for example\nprint(timezone_bumper(t))           # prints \"2022-12-31T15:00:00\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,275],"elapsed":2.08342962,"_type":"aimessage"}]
