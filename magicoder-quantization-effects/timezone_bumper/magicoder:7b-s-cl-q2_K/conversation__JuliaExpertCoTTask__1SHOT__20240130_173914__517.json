If it's a `DateTime`, it performs the bump operation and returns the new `DateTime`. If it's not a `DateTime`, it throws an error indicating that the function only works with DateTime types.\n\nNow, let's test our function:\n```julia\nprintln(timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3))\n```\nThis will output `2023-04-10T15:00:00`, which is the original date/time advanced by 3 hours.","status":200,"tokens":[0,257],"elapsed":1.959340448,"_type":"aimessage"}]
