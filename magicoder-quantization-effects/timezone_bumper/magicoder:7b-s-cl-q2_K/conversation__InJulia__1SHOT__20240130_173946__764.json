It can only be applied to DateTime.\")\nend\n```\nThe `timezone_bumper` function takes in a `DateTime` and an optional integer argument `bump`. By default, the `bump` is set to 3 hours. The function increases the provided timestamp by this much time. \nIf a Date is passed instead of DateTime, an error will be thrown, as it can't apply hourly bump to a Date.","status":200,"tokens":[0,184],"elapsed":1.386363651,"_type":"aimessage"}]
