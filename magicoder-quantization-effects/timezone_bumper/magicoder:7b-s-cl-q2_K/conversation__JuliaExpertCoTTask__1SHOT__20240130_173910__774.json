Here is how you might write this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing TimeZones\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime=now(), bump::Int=3)\n    if typeof(dt) == Date\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Provided argument is a date, not a datetime.\"))\n    end\n    \n    new_time = dt + Hour(bump) \n    \n    return new_time\nend\n```\n\nIn this function `dt` and `bump` are optional parameters. If they aren't provided when calling the function, it will use the current time (`now()`) as the datetime to manipulate, and increase it by 3 hours (which is the default).\n\nNote: This code assumes that you have the TimeZones package installed in your Julia environment. If you don't already have this package, you can add it using Pkg mode with `]add TimeZones`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,230],"elapsed":1.765269541,"_type":"aimessage"}]
