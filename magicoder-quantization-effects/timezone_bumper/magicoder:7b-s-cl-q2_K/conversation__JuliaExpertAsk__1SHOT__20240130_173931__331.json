Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can create the function using Julia's built-in DateTime type and time zones. Here is a simple implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump = 3)\n    if bump < 0 || bump > 24\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Bump value must be between 0 and 24\"))\n    end\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Testing the function\ndt = Dates.now()\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt)\nprintln(dt) # Prints current time\nprintln(bumped_dt) # Prints bumped time\n```\nThe function checks if `bump` is between 0 and 24, otherwise it throws an error. After the check, we just add the number of hours in `bump` to the provided DateTime `dt`. The `Hour(bump)` part does the job of adding the bump value (in hours) to the time.\n  \nPlease note that this function works only for DateTime type and not for Date type. If we pass a Date type, it will throw an error.","status":200,"tokens":[0,264],"elapsed":1.991929334,"_type":"aimessage"}]
