[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump = 3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Test the function\nt = now() # get current time\nprintln(\"Time before bump: \", t)\nt2 = timezone_bumper(t)\nprintln(\"Time after bump: \", t2)\n```\nThis function takes a `DateTime` object and an optional bump value. The default bump is 3 hours, but you can change it by passing the desired number of hours when calling the function. It increases the time stamp by adding the specified number of hours to it. If called with a Date type instead of DateTime type, it will throw an error.\n\nThe `Dates` module in Julia provides utilities for dealing with dates and times, including constructors and methods to create, convert, parse, format, compare, and manipulate date and time values. The `Hour` function from the `Dates` module is used here to increment a given time by a specified number of hours.\n\nNote: This will not work for Date types as requested, but you can add additional error checking if needed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,269],"elapsed":2.142237396,"_type":"aimessage"}]
