It then checks if the input type is indeed DateTime or not. If it's Date, then an error is thrown stating that it doesn't support Date types. If neither of these conditions are met, then another error is thrown stating that the provided argument is of unsupported type.\n\nHowever, please note that you might not be able to test this function as is because `Date` and `DateTime` objects cannot be tested in a console or REPL environment. You need to put them into real code to test it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,238],"elapsed":1.818943058,"_type":"aimessage"}]
