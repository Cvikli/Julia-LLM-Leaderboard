If the `bump` is not specified it defaults to 3 hours. The `+` operator is overloaded for DateTime types in Julia's Dates module to allow for date/time addition. It increases the provided date/time by the bump value.\n\nThe test at the end of your question will return a DateTime object that has been increased by 3 hours from the input.","status":200,"tokens":[0,195],"elapsed":1.511719033,"_type":"aimessage"}]
