Provide datetime.\"))\n    end\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nIn the above code, I am using Dates library to work with dates and times in Julia. \n\n`timezone_bumper()` function takes two arguments: `dt::DateTime=now()`, which is a date time object and defaults to current time if not provided. And `bump::Int = 3`, which indicates the number of hours to bump. \n\nInside the function, I first check if `dt` (i.e., input datetime) is of type Date (i.e., only date, without time), if it's true then throw an error. Then it adds `bump` amount of hours to the `dt`.\n\nIf you provide a DateTime object, it will return the bumped DateTime. If you call this function with a Date object, it will throw an ArgumentError saying \"Cannot use date only. Provide datetime.\"","status":200,"tokens":[103,270],"elapsed":2.143801621,"_type":"aimessage"}]
