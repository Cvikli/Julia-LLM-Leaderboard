The function first checks if the provided argument is indeed of type DateTime, and throws an error if it isn't. If the type check passes, the function adds the number of hours specified by bump to the date-time object using the addition operator (+).\n\nLet's test this function:\n```julia\n@assert timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3) == DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 15, 0)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,234],"elapsed":1.817309358,"_type":"aimessage"}]
