Please provide a DateTime instead of Date.\"))\nend\n```\nIn this function, `Hour` is from Dates library and it's used to increase or decrease the time by hours. If you provide a date as input it will through an error as per your requirements. The `throw` keyword in Julia is used to throw an exception.","status":200,"tokens":[0,185],"elapsed":1.457306121,"_type":"aimessage"}]
