Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can use the `DateTime` type from the Dates module in the standard library to represent timestamps. You can then use arithmetic operations on these objects to manipulate them. Here's how you could implement your function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime=now(), bump::Int=3)\n    if typeof(dt) == Date\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Expected DateTime but got Date\"))\n    end\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks whether the input `dt` is a date (i.e., of type `Date`) and throws an error if it is. If `dt` is indeed a `DateTime`, then it adds the specified number of hours to the time part of the timestamp using the `+` operator with a `Hour` object, which is a predefined unit in the Dates module that represents a specific time duration.\n\nRemember to always include the type annotation (`::`) after the argument name when you define a function because Julia uses static typing and this is a requirement for correct code execution.","status":200,"tokens":[0,248],"elapsed":1.908577273,"_type":"aimessage"}]
