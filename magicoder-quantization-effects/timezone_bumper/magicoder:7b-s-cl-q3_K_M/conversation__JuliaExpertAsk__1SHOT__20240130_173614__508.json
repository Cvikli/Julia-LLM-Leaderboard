If it's not, then it checks whether the input is a `Date` type and throws an error in such cases. If the input is of `DateTime`, it adds `bump` hours to the DateTime object and returns the result. \n\nYou can use this function like this:\n```julia\ntime = Dates.now()\nbumped_time = timezone_bumper(time)\nprintln(\"Bumped time is $(bumped_time)\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,243],"elapsed":1.902581957,"_type":"aimessage"}]
