[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)\n    dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Testing the function\n@test timezone_bumper(Dates.now()) == Dates.now() # This should give you the current date and time with 3 hours added.\n```\n\nThe function `timezone_bumper` takes a datetime as input, adds `bump` number of hours to it and returns the result. If no bump is provided (i.e., it's not specified in the function call), it defaults to adding 3 hours. Note that this function doesn't modify the original DateTime object but instead returns a new one which is the result of the bump operation.\n\nThe `@test` statement checks if `timezone_bumper(Dates.now())` equals to `Dates.now()` which means the function adds 3 hours to the current date and time correctly. \n\nIf you want to ensure it throws an error for Date types, you can modify the function as follows:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)\n    dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Error Handling\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date; bump=3)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"This function only works with DateTime types, not Date.\"))\nend\n```\n\nNow if you try to call `timezone_bumper` on a date type it will throw an error.","status":200,"tokens":[0,354],"elapsed":2.835150662,"_type":"aimessage"}]
