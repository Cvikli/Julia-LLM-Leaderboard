The first one, when given a `DateTime` and an optional `bump` value (defaulting to 3), increases the timestamp by that amount. If you try calling this function with a `Date`, it will throw an error as per your requirement. \n\nTest it out like so:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\ndt = now() # get current datetime\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt,2) # increase by 2 hours\nbumped_dt\n\ndate = today() # get current date\nbumped_date = timezone_bumper(date)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,232],"elapsed":1.849841489,"_type":"aimessage"}]
