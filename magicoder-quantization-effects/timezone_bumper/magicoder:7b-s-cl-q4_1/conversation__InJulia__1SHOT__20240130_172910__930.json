The `bump` parameter is increased on top of the original timestamp value. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# test with a DateTime object and increase by 2 hours\ndt = now()\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, 2)\nprintln(\"Original Date: \", dt)\nprintln(\"Updated Date: \", new_dt)\n```\n\nIn the function `timezone_bumper`, we check if the argument `dt` is of type DateTime using the `::` operator. We then increase this timestamp by `bump` hours using the `+` operator and the `Hour()` function from Dates module. If the date passed in is not a DateTime, an error will occur because there's no method defined for the operation `+` between Date and Int.","status":200,"tokens":[0,248],"elapsed":1.973640957,"_type":"aimessage"}]
