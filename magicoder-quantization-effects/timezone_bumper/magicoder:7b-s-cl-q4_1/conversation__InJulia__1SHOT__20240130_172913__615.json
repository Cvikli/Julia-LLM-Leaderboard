Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can use the Dates library's `TimeZone` function to perform this task. Here is how you could implement a function `timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump=3)` that increases provided timestamp by `bump` hours:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump=3)\n    @assert dt isa DateTime\n    tz = TimeZone(\"UTC\")  # Use UTC as default time zone\n    return tz === \"local\" ? dt : tz == \"utc\" ? dt : dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nThe `@assert` macro ensures that the input `dt` is a DateTime type, and throws an error if it is not. The `TimeZone` function gets the current local time zone, but you can use any valid IANA Time Zone Identifier as string in its argument to change the timezone. \n\nThe returned value of this function will be a new DateTime object at the bumped time, keeping the same date and adjusting for the timezone offset. If `bump` is not specified it defaults to +3 hours.\n\nTo test the function:\n```julia\ndt = now()  # get current date/time\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt)\nprintln(\"Bumped datetime: \", bumped_dt)\n```\nThis will print out the datetime object that is 3 hours ahead of your local time.","status":200,"tokens":[0,333],"elapsed":2.685560562,"_type":"aimessage"}]
