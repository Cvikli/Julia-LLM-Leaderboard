This is added to any DateTime object `dt`. The argument `; bump=3` means that if no value for `bump` is supplied, it will default to 3 hours.\n\nWhen running the code and passing a `DateTime` type (like `now()`) to this function, it will increase the time by 3 hours. If you pass a Date type, Julia will throw an error because the function only accepts DateTime types as input.","status":200,"tokens":[0,208],"elapsed":1.677289885,"_type":"aimessage"}]
