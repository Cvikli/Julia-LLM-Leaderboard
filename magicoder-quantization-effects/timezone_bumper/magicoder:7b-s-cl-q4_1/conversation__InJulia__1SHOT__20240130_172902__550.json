It throws an error when a Date type is passed instead of a DateTime, because Date does not support arithmetic operations.\n\nThis function simply adds `bump` amount of hours to the provided timestamp using the `+` operator with the `Dates.Hour(bump)` argument, which represents 3 hours. The function then returns the resulting date-time.","status":200,"tokens":[0,224],"elapsed":1.780678193,"_type":"aimessage"}]
