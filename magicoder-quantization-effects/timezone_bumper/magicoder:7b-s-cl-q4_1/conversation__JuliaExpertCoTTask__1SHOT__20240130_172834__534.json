The default value of `bump` is set to 3. Inside the function, it checks if the provided argument `dt` is not of type `DateTime`. If it isn't, it throws an error with `throw(ArgumentError(\"Expected DateTime type\"))`. Then it adds the specified number of hours to the timestamp using `Hour(bump)`. If no bump value is provided (only a `DateTime` object), it will use 3 hours as default.","status":200,"tokens":[0,266],"elapsed":2.13722645,"_type":"aimessage"}]
