If not provided, it defaults to 3 hours.\n- Inside the function:\n    - We first check if the passed argument `dt` is of type DateTime. If not, we throw an ArgumentError with the message \"Only DateTime type is allowed\".\n    - If `dt` is a DateTime, then we add the number of hours given by `bump` to it and return the new DateTime.\n- The function returns the updated time after bumping by `bump` number of hours.\n  \nYou can test this function with different date and time inputs:\n\n```julia\njulia> t = now()\n2021-09-07T14:39:54.136\n\njulia> timezone_bumper(t)\n2021-09-07T17:39:54.136\n\njulia> t = Date() # This will throw an error, because it's not a DateTime type.\nERROR: ArgumentError: Only DateTime type is allowed\nStacktrace:\n [1] timezone_bumper at ./<path to your script>/timezone_bumper.jl:5 in var\"#timezone_bumper\" (repeats 2 times)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,416],"elapsed":3.338828262,"_type":"aimessage"}]
