If no value is provided for `bump`, it defaults to 3. The function then returns the input datetime plus the number of hours specified by `bump`.\n\nThe `Hour(bump)` part is used to add the specified number of hours to the DateTime object.\n\nWhen testing this function, we use the built-in `now()` function from the Dates module to get the current time and then bump it up by 2 hours using our defined function. The result is printed out on the console.","status":200,"tokens":[0,237],"elapsed":4.115914079,"_type":"aimessage"}]
