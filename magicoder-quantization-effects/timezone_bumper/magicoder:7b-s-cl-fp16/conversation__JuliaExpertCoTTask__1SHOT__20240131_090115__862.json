If no `bump` is provided, it defaults to 3. It checks if the input is of type DateTime. If not, it throws an error. Otherwise, it returns the DateTime object incremented by the number of hours specified in `bump`.\n\nYou can test this function with your example:\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,202],"elapsed":3.481900944,"_type":"aimessage"}]
