If no bump value is provided, it defaults to 3 hours.\n- It checks if the input dt is not of DateTime type. If it's not, it throws an ArgumentError with a message indicating the problem.\n- If the input is valid, it adds the bump hours to the datetime and returns the result.\n- The function is then tested using the provided example.","status":200,"tokens":[0,222],"elapsed":3.841788399,"_type":"aimessage"}]
