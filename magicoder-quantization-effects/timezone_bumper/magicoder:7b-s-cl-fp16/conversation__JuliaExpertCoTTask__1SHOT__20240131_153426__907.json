Here is a function that does what you asked:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)\n    if typeof(dt) == Date\n        error(\"Provided data should be of type DateTime, not Date.\")\n    else\n        return dt + Hour(bump)\n    end\nend\n```\nThe function first checks whether the provided argument is a DateTime. If it's not, an error is thrown. If it is, the function adds the specified number of hours to the DateTime object and returns the result.\n\nYou can test this function using your data:\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)\n```\nThis will return `2023-04-10T15:00:00`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,220],"elapsed":3.807996973,"_type":"aimessage"}]
