The second argument is optional and defaults to 3. If `dt` is a `Date` instead of a `DateTime`, it throws an error with the message \"Input must be a DateTime, not a Date.\" Otherwise, it adds the number of hours specified by `bump` to the time in `dt`.\n\nYou can test this function using your example:\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)\n```\nThis will return `2023-04-10T15:00:00` which is the original time increased by 3 hours.","status":200,"tokens":[0,266],"elapsed":4.605031416,"_type":"aimessage"}]
