The `DateTime` struct from the Dates module represents date and time including timezone information while the `Date` struct only contains the date component but no timezone information.\n\nThe function `timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)` first checks if `dt` is of type `Date`. If it's true, an `ArgumentError` is thrown. Afterwards, `dt + Dates.Hour(bump)` increases the DateTime by a number of hours specified in the `bump` argument (defaulting to 3 if no argument is provided). The result is then returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,258],"elapsed":4.488112502,"_type":"aimessage"}]
