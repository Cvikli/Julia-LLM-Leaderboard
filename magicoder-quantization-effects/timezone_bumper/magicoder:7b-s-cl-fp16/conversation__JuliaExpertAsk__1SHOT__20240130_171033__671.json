Please provide DateTime.\")\n    else                    \n        return dt + Hour(bump)  # Increase by `bump` hours\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `Dates` package in Julia to create, manipulate and display dates and times. It checks if the type of the provided date is Date. If it is, it throws an error saying that a DateTime must be provided. Else, it increases the timestamp by bump hours. The Hour function from Dates library specifies the duration as hours.","status":200,"tokens":[0,196],"elapsed":3.467485245,"_type":"aimessage"}]
