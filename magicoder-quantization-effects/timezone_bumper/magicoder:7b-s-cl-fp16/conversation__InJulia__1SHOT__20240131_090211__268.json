The function checks if the input `dt` is of type `DateTime`. If it is, then it adds `bump` hours to the time part of the datetime object and returns the result.\n\nIf `dt` is not a `DateTime`, then the function checks if it's a `Date`. If it is, an error message is thrown because this function only works with `DateTime` types.","status":200,"tokens":[0,210],"elapsed":3.622394758,"_type":"aimessage"}]
