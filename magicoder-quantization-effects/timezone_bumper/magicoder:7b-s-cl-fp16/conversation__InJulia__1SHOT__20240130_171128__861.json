Here is a function that accomplishes what was asked:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)\n    if typeof(dt) != DateTime\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Provided argument must be of type DateTime\"))\n    end\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nIn the function above, `Hour` is a function from Dates.jl that takes an integer and returns a Period of time that is equivalent to that number of hours. It then adds this period to the input DateTime object. \n\nThe argument `; bump=3` in the function signature means that if you don't provide a second argument when calling the function, it will use 3 as the default value for `bump`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,193],"elapsed":3.35206737,"_type":"aimessage"}]
