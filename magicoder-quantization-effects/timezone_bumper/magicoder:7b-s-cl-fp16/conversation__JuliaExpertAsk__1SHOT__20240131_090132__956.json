If no argument is provided, it defaults to 3 hours. It then returns the original DateTime object incremented by the number of hours specified in the `bump` argument.\n\nThe test at the end creates a DateTime object from the current time, prints it out, bumps it up with the function, and then prints out the new time. If an error occurs (for example if you try to pass a Date instead of a DateTime), it gets caught by the catch block and an error message is printed to the console.","status":200,"tokens":[0,246],"elapsed":4.251548079,"_type":"aimessage"}]
