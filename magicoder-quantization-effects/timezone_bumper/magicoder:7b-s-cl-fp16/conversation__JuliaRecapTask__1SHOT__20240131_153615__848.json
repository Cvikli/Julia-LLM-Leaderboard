[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function in Julia that implements the described functionality:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates # Import the package for working with dates and times\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump) \nend\n\n# Testing the function\ndt = now() # Get current date time\nprintln(\"Original Time: \", dt)\nbumped_time = timezone_bumper(dt)\nprintln(\"Bumped Time: \", bumped_time)\n```\nThe function `timezone_bumper` takes a DateTime object and an optional argument `bump`. If the `bump` argument is not provided, it defaults to 3. The function then increases the DateTime by the amount specified in the `bump` argument using the `+` operator with `Hour(bump)`.\n\nThe `now()` function from the Dates module returns a DateTime object representing the current system time. This is used for testing purposes, but you can replace it with any DateTime object as needed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,232],"elapsed":4.045385064,"_type":"aimessage"}]
