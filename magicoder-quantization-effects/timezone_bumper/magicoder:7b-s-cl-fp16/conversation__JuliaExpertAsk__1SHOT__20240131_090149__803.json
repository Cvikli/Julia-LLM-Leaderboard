This function takes a DateTime object and an optional bump argument (defaults to 3). If a Date type is passed instead of a DateTime, it throws an error. Otherwise, it increases the timestamp by the specified number of hours.","status":200,"tokens":[0,156],"elapsed":2.688646347,"_type":"aimessage"}]
