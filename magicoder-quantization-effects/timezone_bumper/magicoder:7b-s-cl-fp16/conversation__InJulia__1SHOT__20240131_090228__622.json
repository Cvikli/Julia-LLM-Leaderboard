The `DateTime` type represents a date and time, while the `Date` type represents just a date.\n\nThe function `timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump=3)` takes two arguments: `dt`, which is a DateTime object to be modified, and `bump`, which defaults to 3 hours but can also be specified explicitly when calling the function.\n\nIf `dt` is of type Date (i.e., it's not a DateTime), an ArgumentError is thrown with the message \"This function works only with DateTime types.\" If `dt` is a DateTime, it adds `bump` hours to it and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,243],"elapsed":4.266415061,"_type":"aimessage"}]
