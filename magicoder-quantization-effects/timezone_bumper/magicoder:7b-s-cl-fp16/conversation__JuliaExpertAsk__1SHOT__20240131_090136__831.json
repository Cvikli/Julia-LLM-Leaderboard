The second argument, `bump`, is optional and defaults to 3 hours if not provided. If `dt` is not a DateTime type, an ArgumentError will be thrown. Otherwise, it returns the DateTime object `dt` increased by `bump` hours.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n```julia\ndt = now() # get current date and time\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt)  # bump dt by default 3 hours\nbumped_dt2 = timezone_bumper(dt, 5)  # bump dt by 5 hours\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,240],"elapsed":4.153888721,"_type":"aimessage"}]
