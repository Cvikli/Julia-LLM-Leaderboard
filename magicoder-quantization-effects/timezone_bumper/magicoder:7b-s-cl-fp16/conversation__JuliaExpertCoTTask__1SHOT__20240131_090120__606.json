If no second argument is provided, it defaults to 3 hours. It checks if the input is of type `Date`. If it is, it throws an error. Otherwise, it increases the DateTime by the specified number of hours (defaulting to 3) using the `+` operator with a `Hour` object from the Dates module.\n\nYou can test this function with your example:\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)\n```\nThis should return `2023-04-10T15:00:00`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,249],"elapsed":4.309517825,"_type":"aimessage"}]
