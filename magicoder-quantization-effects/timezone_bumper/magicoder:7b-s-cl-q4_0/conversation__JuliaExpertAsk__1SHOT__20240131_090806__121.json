If no argument is provided for `bump`, it defaults to 3. The function then returns the DateTime object `dt` increased by the number of hours specified in `bump`.\n\nThe function throws an error if you try to pass a Date type instead of a DateTime:\n```julia\ndate = now() |> Date # get current date\nbumped_time = timezone_bumper(date) \n```\nThis will throw the following error: `MethodError: no method matching timezone_bumper(::Date)`. This is because we are trying to call the function with a Date object, which is not allowed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,260],"elapsed":1.98670005,"_type":"aimessage"}]
