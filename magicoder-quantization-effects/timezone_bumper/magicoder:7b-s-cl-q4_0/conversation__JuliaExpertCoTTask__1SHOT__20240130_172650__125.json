If `bump` is not provided, it defaults to 3. The function then checks if the input variable is of type DateTime. If it's not, an error message is thrown. Finally, the function adds the value of the `bump` parameter in hours to the date time object and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,171],"elapsed":1.303572465,"_type":"aimessage"}]
