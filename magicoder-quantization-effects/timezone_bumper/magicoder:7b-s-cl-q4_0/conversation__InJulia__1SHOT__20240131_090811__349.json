The function `timezone_bumper()` takes a `DateTime` type as an argument and returns a new DateTime object that is `bump` hours ahead of the original time. If no argument is provided, it defaults to 3 hours.\n\nWe then test this function by passing in a `DateTime` object and printing out both the original time and the time after bumping. If we pass in a `Date` type instead, Julia will throw an error saying \"Function only works with DateTime types\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,275],"elapsed":2.088707575,"_type":"aimessage"}]
