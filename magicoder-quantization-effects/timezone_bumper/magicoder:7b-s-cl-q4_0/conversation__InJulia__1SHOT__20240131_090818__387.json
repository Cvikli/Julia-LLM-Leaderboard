The first version accepts a DateTime type and returns a new DateTime object that is `bump` hours ahead of the input date-time. The second version accepts a Date type and throws an error message. This way, if you pass in a Date, it will throw an error, but if you pass in a DateTime, it will work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[0,174],"elapsed":1.328017979,"_type":"aimessage"}]
