If no value is provided for `bump`, it defaults to 3 hours. The function throws an error when a Date type is passed instead of a DateTime.\n\nPlease note that this function will only work with DateTime types and not with Date types. When you run this code, it will print out the original time and then the new time after bumping it by 4 hours.","status":200,"tokens":[0,223],"elapsed":1.711502211,"_type":"aimessage"}]
