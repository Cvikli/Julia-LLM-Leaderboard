[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

Note that the function `timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)` checks if the provided argument is of type DateTime before doing anything else. If it isn't, an error will be thrown. Also, by using `DateTime(dt) + Dates.Hour(bump)`, we increase the DateTime object by a specified number of hours.\n\n```julia\nimport Dates # necessary for manipulating date and time\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3) \n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)  \nend\n\n# Testing the function\ndt = Dates.now() # get current date and time\nbump_time = timezone_bumper(dt) # increase by default of 3 hours\nprintln(\"Time after bump: \", bump_time)\n```\n\nIn this script, we first import the `Dates` module for manipulating date and time. Then we define a function `timezone_bumper`. This function takes two arguments - `dt::DateTime` (the datetime object whose timezone needs to be bumped) and `bump::Int=3` (the number of hours by which the datetime object's timezone should be bumped, defaults to 3 if not provided). Inside the function, we simply return `dt + Dates.Hour(bump)`.\n\nThe `Dates.now()` function is used to get the current date and time. The `timezone_bumper(dt)` call increases this by three hours (if no argument for `bump` is provided), then it prints out this bumped time.","status":200,"tokens":[0,372],"elapsed":2.907975699,"_type":"aimessage"}]
