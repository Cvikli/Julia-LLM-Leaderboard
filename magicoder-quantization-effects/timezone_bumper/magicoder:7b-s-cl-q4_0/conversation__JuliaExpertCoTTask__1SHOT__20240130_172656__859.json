The default value of the `bump` parameter is 3 if not specified during the function call.\n\nThe function checks to see whether the input argument `dt` is of type `DateTime`. If it's not, then an error message will be displayed. If `dt` is a `DateTime`, it will increase the date and time by the number of hours specified in `bump`. The increased DateTime value is then returned from the function.\n\nTo use this function with the given task data: \n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,254],"elapsed":1.939157357,"_type":"aimessage"}]
