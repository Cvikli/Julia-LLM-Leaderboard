If no argument is provided for `bump`, it defaults to 3 hours. The function simply adds the value of `bump` to the input datetime object and returns the result.\n\nWe then test this function with the current date/time, and print out both the original time and the bumped time. If we pass a Date type instead of DateTime, it will throw an error because Date is not a subtype of DateTime.","status":200,"tokens":[0,223],"elapsed":1.701272963,"_type":"aimessage"}]
