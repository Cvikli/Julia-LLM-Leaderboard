Use DateTime instead.\")\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, we first import the `Dates` package in Julia which provides several functions for manipulating dates and times. \n\nNext, we define a function called `timezone_bumper`. This function takes one argument: `dt`, which is of type DateTime. If no second argument is provided, it defaults to 3 hours. The function simply adds the number of hours specified by `bump` to the timestamp.\n\nWe also define another function `timezone_bumper` for Date types. This function throws an error message when a Date object is passed in. This is because as per the problem statement, it should only work with DateTime types and not Date types.","status":200,"tokens":[0,226],"elapsed":1.718074137,"_type":"aimessage"}]
