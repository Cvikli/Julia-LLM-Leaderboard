If the provided timestamp is of type `DateTime`, it increases the timestamp by the given number of hours. However, if the timestamp is of type `Date`, it throws an error because `Date` does not have a concept of time zones or offsets.","status":200,"tokens":[0,178],"elapsed":1.330413181,"_type":"aimessage"}]
