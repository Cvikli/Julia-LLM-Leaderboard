Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump=3)\n    return dt+Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Test the function\nt = now() # Get current time\nprintln(\"Original Time: \", t)\nbumped_time = timezone_bumper(t)\nprintln(\"Bumped Time : \", bumped_time)\n```\nThis code first imports the Dates package to use the DateTime and Hour types. The function `timezone_bumper` takes a DateTime object `dt` and an optional argument `bump`. If the `bump` argument is not provided, it defaults to 3 hours.\n\nThe function then adds the bump value (defaults to 3) to the time using the `+` operator on the `DateTime` object. It returns the new DateTime object that represents the increased time.\n\nYou can test this function by getting the current time and passing it to the function, printing both the original and the increased times.","status":200,"tokens":[0,235],"elapsed":1.775905118,"_type":"aimessage"}]
