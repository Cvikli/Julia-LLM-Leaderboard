It then returns the DateTime object incremented by the specified number of hours. If you try to pass in a Date type instead of a DateTime, Julia will throw an error.\n\nNote: The `now()` function is used to get the current date and time.","status":200,"tokens":[0,189],"elapsed":1.455710758,"_type":"aimessage"}]
