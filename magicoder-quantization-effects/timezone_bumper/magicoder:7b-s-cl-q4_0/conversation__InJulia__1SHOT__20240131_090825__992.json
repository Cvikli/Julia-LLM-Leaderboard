It accepts an optional second argument `bump`, which defaults to 3 if not provided. The function then returns the original timestamp increased by the number of hours specified in `bump`.\n\nWe test this function with a DateTime type and it should print the current time plus 3 hours. Then, we try to call this function with a Date type, expecting an error because Date types cannot be bumped like DateTime types. The error is caught and its details are printed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,262],"elapsed":1.989430572,"_type":"aimessage"}]
