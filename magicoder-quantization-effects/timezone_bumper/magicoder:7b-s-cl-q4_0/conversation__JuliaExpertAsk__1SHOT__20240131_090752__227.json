If no argument is provided, it defaults to 3 hours.\n- It increases the timestamp by `bump` hours using the `+` operator on a `Hour` type.\n- A try-catch block is used to handle exceptions. The function will throw an error if a `Date` object is passed instead of a `DateTime`. This is done by checking if the exception thrown is a `MethodError`, which occurs when trying to call a method that doesn't exist for a certain type.\n- Finally, we test the function with current time and decrease it by one hour.","status":200,"tokens":[103,306],"elapsed":2.377758637,"_type":"aimessage"}]
