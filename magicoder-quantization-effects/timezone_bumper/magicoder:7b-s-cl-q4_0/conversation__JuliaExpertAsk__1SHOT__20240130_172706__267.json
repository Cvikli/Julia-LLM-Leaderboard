Use DateTime type, not Date type.\"))\nend\n```\nIn this code, we first define a function `timezone_bumper` which accepts a `DateTime` and optionally an `Int` (defaulting to `3`). If the user provides a `Date` instead of a `DateTime`, then the second function is called with no arguments and throws an error. The `+ Hour(bump)` operation increases the time by the number of hours specified in the `bump` argument.\n\nNote: This code will throw an error if you try to call it with a date, but for the sake of completion I included the function to do that as well.","status":200,"tokens":[0,222],"elapsed":1.703568835,"_type":"aimessage"}]
