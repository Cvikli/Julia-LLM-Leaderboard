It first checks if the input is indeed a DateTime. If it's not, it throws an error. After that, it increases the provided timestamp by the given number of hours and returns the new datetime.\n\nYou can now call your function:\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)\n```\nThis will return `2023-04-10T15:00:00`. As you can see the time has been increased by three hours.","status":200,"tokens":[0,254],"elapsed":1.955537028,"_type":"aimessage"}]
