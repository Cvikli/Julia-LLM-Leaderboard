Here's a possible solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime=now(), bump::Int=3)\n    if typeof(dt) == Date \n        throw(DomainError(\"Date type is not accepted, use DateTime\"))\n    end\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nThe `timezone_bumper` function now accepts two arguments: a date/datetime value (`dt`) and the number of hours to bump (`bump`). If no argument for `dt` is provided, it defaults to the current time. The function will throw an error if the input type is not DateTime. Otherwise, it adds the given amount of hours (defaulting to 3) to the datetime value.","status":200,"tokens":[0,198],"elapsed":1.562667974,"_type":"aimessage"}]
