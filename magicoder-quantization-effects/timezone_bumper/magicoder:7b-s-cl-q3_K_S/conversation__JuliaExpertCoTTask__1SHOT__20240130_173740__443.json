[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

Provided $dt is a Date.\"))\n    else\n        return dt + Hour(bump)\n    end\nend\n```\nIn the above code, I use the `Dates` module from Julia standard library for working with dates and times. The function throws an error if it receives a date (Date type) instead of a DateTime object. If it receives a correct input, i.e., a DateTime object, it adds the number of hours provided (defaults to 3) to the time zone of this DateTime object.\n\nYou can test this function with the following code:\n\n```julia\njulia> dt = timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)\n2023-04-10T15:00:00\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,254],"elapsed":2.007311372,"_type":"aimessage"}]
