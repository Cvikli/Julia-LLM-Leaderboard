You provided $dt.\"))\n    else\n        return dt + Hour(bump)\n    end\nend\n```\nYou can call this function with a `DateTime` type and it will bump the time by the specified number of hours. If you pass an incorrect type (like a `Date`), Julia's static typing system will prevent you from running the code, throwing an `ArgumentError`.\n\nHere is an example usage:\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(2021, 1, 1, 12)\nbump_by_three_hours = timezone_bumper(dt)\nprint(bump_by_three_hours) # prints 2021-01-01T15:00:00\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,237],"elapsed":1.866643112,"_type":"aimessage"}]
