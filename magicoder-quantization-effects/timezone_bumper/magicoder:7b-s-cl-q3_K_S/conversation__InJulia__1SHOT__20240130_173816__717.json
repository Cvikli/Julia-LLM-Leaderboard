Here is how you would write such a function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)\n    if typeof(dt) != DateTime\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Provided argument must be of DateTime type.\"))\n    end\n\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nThe function `timezone_bumper` takes a DateTime object and an optional bump value as input. It first checks if the provided argument is actually a DateTime by checking its data type. If it isn't, it throws an error. Then, it increases the timestamp by the specified number of hours (defaulting to 3), and finally returns the updated timestamp.","status":200,"tokens":[0,188],"elapsed":1.472795675,"_type":"aimessage"}]
