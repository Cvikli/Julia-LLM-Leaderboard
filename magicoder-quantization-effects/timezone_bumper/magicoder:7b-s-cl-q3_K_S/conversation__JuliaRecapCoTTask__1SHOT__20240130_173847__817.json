[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that fulfills the task:\n\n```julia\nimport Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Dates.DateTime; bump=3)\n    if typeof(dt) != Dates.DateTime\n        error(\"Provided argument should be of DateTime type\")\n    end\n\n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a `Dates.DateTime` object and an optional integer argument `bump`. By default, it bumps the time by 3 hours, as specified in the task. If another value is provided for `bump`, it will be used instead.\n\nPlease note that if you want to use this function with a Date type (which are not allowed), Julia would throw an error when calling timezone_bumper(d::Date) because the test typeof(dt) != Dates.DateTime does not match as Date is not of DateTime type, but Date and DateTime are completely different types in Julia. So it's not possible to make the function work with a Date type directly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,237],"elapsed":1.903891749,"_type":"aimessage"}]
