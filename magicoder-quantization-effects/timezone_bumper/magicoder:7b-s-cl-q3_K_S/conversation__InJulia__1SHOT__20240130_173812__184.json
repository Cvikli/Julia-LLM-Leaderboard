Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# This function throws an error when a Date type is passed instead of DateTime.\ntry\n    date = Date(2022, 1, 1)\n    timezone_bumper(date) # This will throw an error.\ncatch e\n    println(\"An error occurred: $(e)\")\nend\n```\n\nNow let's test it on a DateTime instance:\n\n```julia\ndt = now()\nbumpdt = timezone_bumper(dt)\nprintln(\"Original datetime: $dt, Bumped datetime: $bumpdt\")\n```\n\nIn the above code, we first import `Dates` to use date and time related functions. Then, in our function definition, we have a parameter `dt::DateTime; bump=3`. If no second argument (the default bump value) is provided, it takes +3 hours by default. \n\nThe function returns the datetime after bumping it by adding an interval of hours equivalent to the number of bumps. \n\nIn the catch block, we are trying to call `timezone_bumper(date)`. Since date is not a DateTime type, an error will be thrown. This code handles that exception and prints the message \"An error occurred: ArgumentError()\" which helps us know what happened.","status":200,"tokens":[0,332],"elapsed":2.597758571,"_type":"aimessage"}]
