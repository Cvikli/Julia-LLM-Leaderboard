[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

Here's a solution in Julia:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\n\"\"\"\n    timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump=3)\n\nIncrease any provided timestamp by `bump` hours.\n\n# Arguments\n- `dt`: Input DateTime object.\n- `bump::Int`: Amount of hours to increase the time. Defaults to 3.\n\n# Returns\nModified DateTime after adding `bump` hours.\n\"\"\"\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump=3)\n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nThis function checks if the input is a DateTime object and then increases it by the specified number of hours (defaults to 3). If not a DateTime object, an error will be thrown as Date type does not support this kind of manipulation. This solution ensures that only DateTime types are processed, providing a strong type check at compile-time.","status":200,"tokens":[0,217],"elapsed":1.754533281,"_type":"aimessage"}]
