[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

If the provided input is not of DateTime type, it throws an error. Otherwise, it returns the modified DateTime after bumping the time by hours specified by the bump parameter.\n\nFor example, you can call the function with the given default parameters as follows: \n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3) # It will return DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 15, 0)\n```\nPlease note that the `now( UTC )+Hour(3)` is used to get current date and time in UTC timezone.","status":200,"tokens":[0,268],"elapsed":2.129700434,"_type":"aimessage"}]
