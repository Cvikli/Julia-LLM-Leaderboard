[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

The `bump` parameter defaults to 3 if no value is provided, but you can pass any integer you wish to increase the time by that many hours. If the input `dt` is not of type `DateTime`, then it throws an error.\n\nThe function uses the built-in package `Dates` and `Hour` constructor from `Julia Dates` library, which helps in manipulating dates and times easily. The `+` operator with `Hour(bump)` increments the time by `bump` hours. \n\nTesting this function:\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3) # Returns DateTime 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,286],"elapsed":3.211641131,"_type":"aimessage"}]
