If another value is passed, it has to be of DateTime type.\n- The second argument, `bump`, is an integer that denotes how much you want to increase the timestamp by. Defaults to 3 hours if not provided.\n\nThe function checks whether the first argument (`dt`) is a DateTime type or not. If not, it throws an exception with a message \"Input must be of DateTime type\". \n\nIf `dt` is a DateTime type, it adds `bump` number of hours to the datetime object and returns the new datetime object.","status":200,"tokens":[0,255],"elapsed":2.854264198,"_type":"aimessage"}]
