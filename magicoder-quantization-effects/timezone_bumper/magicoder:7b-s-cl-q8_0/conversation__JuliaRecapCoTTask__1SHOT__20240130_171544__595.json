[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible Julia solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump = 3)\n    # Check if input type is DateTime. Throw error for Date type.\n    @assert dt isa DateTime \"Input must be of DateTime type.\"\n    \n    # Add bump hours to the timestamp\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\ntimestamp = DateTime(\"2021-10-30T00:00\") \nnew_timestamp = timezone_bumper(timestamp)   # new timestamp is \"2021-10-30T03:00\"\nanother_timestamp = timezone_bumper(timestamp, 5)  # another timestamp is \"2021-10-30T05:00\"\n```\n\nIn the above code, `DateTime` is a type in the Dates module of Julia that represents date and time. The function `timezone_bumper` takes an argument `dt::DateTime` which ensures it gets called only on DateTime instances. If another datatype is passed as an argument, it raises an error with message \"Input must be of DateTime type.\"\n\nThe second parameter `bump=3` has a default value which means if we do not pass the bump parameter in function call, it will take 3 by default. This behavior can be changed based on requirements. The operation `dt + Hour(bump)` is used to increase the timestamp by bump hours.\n\nYou can replace \"2021-10-30T00:00\" with any valid DateTime string format. \n\nThis function will throw an error if you pass a Date object instead of DateTime object. If you want to handle that scenario, you need to add additional code to check if the provided input is of type `Date` and convert it to `DateTime`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,441],"elapsed":5.037168188,"_type":"aimessage"}]
