[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's a simple function in Julia that solves your problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates  # Import the date module from Julia's standard library\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump = 3)\n    if typeof(dt) != DateTime\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be a DateTime type\"))\n    end\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, we've defined a function `timezone_bumper` that takes one required argument (`dt`) and two optional arguments (`; bump = 3`). The `DateTime` type check at the start of the function ensures that only DateTime types are accepted as input. If an incompatible type is provided, an ArgumentError is thrown.\n\nThe function then returns a new DateTime that has been increased by the number of hours specified by `bump`. This is done using Julia's built-in `+` operator with `Hour(bump)` from the Dates package.\n\nNote: `DateTime` and `Date` are different types in Julia, so this function will throw an error if a Date type is passed in. \n\nYou can call the function as follows:\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(\"2021-12-31T22:00:00\")\nbump = 3\nnew_datetime = timezone_bumper(dt, bump=bump)\nprintln(new_datetime)  # Outputs \"2022-01-01T05:00:00\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,356],"elapsed":4.060612282,"_type":"aimessage"}]
