If it isn't, an error will be thrown. The second optional parameter `bump` is set to 3 by default but you can provide any Int value. The function then returns the result of adding the provided number of hours to the input timestamp.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(2018,1,1,12) # Create a DateTime object.\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, 5) # Increase dt by 5 hours.\nprintln(bumped_dt) # Prints \"2018-01-01T17:00:00\".\n```","status":200,"tokens":[103,278],"elapsed":3.146215834,"_type":"aimessage"}]
