If it's a Date (which is a subtype of DateTime), then it throws an error. Otherwise, it adds the number of hours specified by bump to the datetime object and returns the result. \n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n```julia\ndt = now()\nbump_by3 = timezone_bumper(dt) # default bump is +3 hours\nbump_by5 = timezone_bumper(dt, 5) # bump by 5 hours\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,217],"elapsed":2.430093624,"_type":"aimessage"}]
