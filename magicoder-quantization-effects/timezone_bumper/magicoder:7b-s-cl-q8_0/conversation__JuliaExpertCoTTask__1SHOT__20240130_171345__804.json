If not, an error is thrown. Otherwise, it adds `bump` hours to `dt`, defaulting to 3 hours if no `bump` value is provided.\n\nWe can then test the function with your given data:\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3) # It should return DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 15, 0)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,213],"elapsed":2.381689549,"_type":"aimessage"}]
