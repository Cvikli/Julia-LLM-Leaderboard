[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple solution that leverages the built-in `DateTime` and `TimeZone` functionalities in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates  # Import the date and time functions from the Dates package.\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump=3)\n    if typeof(dt) != DateTime\n        throw(ErrorException(\"The provided type is not of DateTime type\"))\n    end\n    \n    return dt + Hour(bump)  # Return a new datetime after adding the specified number of hours.\nend\n```\nIn this function, we first check if the input `dt` is actually a `DateTime`. If it's not, we throw an exception. Otherwise, we add the provided number of hours to the time and return the result.\n\nThe function can be called with a DateTime object like:\n\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(2023, 1, 1, 12)  # Create a datetime object.\nbumped_time = timezone_bumper(dt)  # Bump the time by default +3 hours.\nprintln(bumped_time)  # Print the bumped time.\n```\n\nThe function also supports passing an explicit value for `bump` parameter:\n\n```julia\nbumped_time = timezone_bumper(dt,4)  # Bump the time by +4 hours instead of default +3 hours.\nprintln(bumped_time)  # Print the bumped time.\n```\n\nThe above code is based on Julia's built-in `Dates` package for handling dates and times.","status":200,"tokens":[0,364],"elapsed":4.14884741,"_type":"aimessage"}]
