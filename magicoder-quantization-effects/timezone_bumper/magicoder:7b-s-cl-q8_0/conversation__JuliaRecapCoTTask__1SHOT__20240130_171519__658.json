[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia function to solve this problem. The instructions are given a priority over the general guidelines:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump = 3)\n    if typeof(dt) != DateTime\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be of DateTime type.\"))\n    end\n    dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `Dates` package which is built-in in Julia. The function `timezone_bumper` takes a `DateTime` and an optional keyword argument `bump`. By default, if no value for `bump` is passed, it'll bump the time by 3 hours.\n\nThis function works as follows:\n1. It checks whether the provided input is of DateTime type or not. If it is not a DateTime object, it throws an error.\n2. Then it adds the number of hours given by `bump` to the DateTime object and returns the result.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n```julia\ndt = now()  # get current time\nbumped_time = timezone_bumper(dt)  # bump by default 3 hours\nbumped_time = timezone_bumper(dt, 5)  # bump by 5 hours\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,296],"elapsed":3.370228472,"_type":"aimessage"}]
