If it's not, an error is thrown. Then, if the `bump` parameter isn't provided, its default value is 3 hours. Finally, the function returns a new DateTime object that represents `dt` time shifted by `bump` hours.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n```julia\nt = now(Dates.UTC) # Get current date and time\nprintln(timezone_bumper(t)) \n# Outputs the current date and time, but with a time shift of +3 hours\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,224],"elapsed":1.914495378,"_type":"aimessage"}]
