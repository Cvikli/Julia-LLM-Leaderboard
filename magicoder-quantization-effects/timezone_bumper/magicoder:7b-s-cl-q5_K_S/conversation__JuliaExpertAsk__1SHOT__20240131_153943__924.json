Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia code that implements this functionality:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)\n    if typeof(dt) != DateTime \n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be of type DateTime\"))\n    end\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nIn this code, `Dates` is a Julia standard library which defines types and functions for date and time manipulation. The function `timezone_bumper` takes a `DateTime` object as input and an optional argument `bump`. If no value of `bump` is provided it defaults to 3 hours.\n\nThe function first checks whether the input type is DateTime or not, if it's not then throws an error with a message \"Input must be of type DateTime\".\n\nIf the input is of correct type, then it adds the number of hours specified by `bump` to the input datetime and returns the result. The addition operation is done using the `+` operator which in this case is overloaded for DateTime objects to perform time arithmetic. Here `Hour(bump)` represents a duration of `bump` hours.\n\nYou can use the function like this:\n```julia\ndt = timezone_bumper(now())\nprintln(dt)\n```\nThis will print the current datetime with 3 hours added to it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,306],"elapsed":2.628966373,"_type":"aimessage"}]
