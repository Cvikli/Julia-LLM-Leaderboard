For example:\n\n```julia\nprintln(timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)) # Outputs: 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n```\nThis function will throw an error if a Date object is passed in place of a DateTime object. For example:\n\n```julia\nprintln(timezone_bumper(Date(2023, 4, 10))) # Throws ArgumentError: Input must be of type DateTime\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,256],"elapsed":2.200624148,"_type":"aimessage"}]
