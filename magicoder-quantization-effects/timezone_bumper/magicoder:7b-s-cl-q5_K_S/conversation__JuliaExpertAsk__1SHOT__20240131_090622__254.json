The second argument, `bump` (defaulted to 3), is how many hours you want to increase the timestamp by.\n\nThe function first checks if the input type of `dt` is DateTime. If it's not a DateTime type, an ArgumentError will be thrown with the message \"Input must be a DateTime type\".\n\nIf `dt` is indeed a DateTime, then the function adds `bump` hours to `dt` and returns the result. The `Hour(bump)` part of the code is what increases the timestamp by `bump` hours.","status":200,"tokens":[0,225],"elapsed":1.939347944,"_type":"aimessage"}]
