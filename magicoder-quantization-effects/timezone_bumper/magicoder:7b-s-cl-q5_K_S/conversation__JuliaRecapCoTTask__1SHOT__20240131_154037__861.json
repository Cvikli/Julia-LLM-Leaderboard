[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

By default, it increases the time by 3 hours. If you want to increase the time by a different amount, you can pass this as an argument when calling the function. The function checks if the input is of type DateTime, and throws an error if it's not.\n\nYou can call this function with a `DateTime` object like this:\n```julia\ndt = now()\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt)  # bumps dt by 3 hours\n```\nOr you can pass the number of hours to bump as an argument:\n```julia\ndt = now()\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, 5)  # bumps dt by 5 hours\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,261],"elapsed":2.293970113,"_type":"aimessage"}]
