Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can implement such a function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates  # Import the Dates module for working with dates and times\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)\n    if bump <= 0 || typeof(dt) != DateTime\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Expected a DateTime type but got $dt\"))\n    end\n    \n    return dt + Hour(bump)  # Increase the timestamp by `bump` hours.\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a date-time object (of type `DateTime`) and an optional integer value to bump up the time (defaults to 3). If `bump` is not provided, it defaults to 3. It first checks if the given argument is of type `DateTime`, if not it throws an error. Afterward, it increases the time by `bump` hours and returns the new date-time object.\n\nLet's test this function:\n\n```julia\ndt = now()  # Get current datetime\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(dt)  # Bump the timestamp up by default (3 hours)\nprintln(\"Original Time: \", dt, \"\\nBumped Time: \", new_dt)\n```\nThe function will increase the current date-time object `dt` by default of 3 hours and print both original and bumped date-times.\n\nPlease note that this function works for DateTime types only. If you try to pass a Date type it will raise an error as expected:\n\n```julia\nbump_date = Date(2021,4,28)\nnew_time = timezone_bumper(bump_date)  # This should throw an ArgumentError\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,394],"elapsed":3.42097213,"_type":"aimessage"}]
