If it's not, we throw an error with the message \"Input must be a DateTime type\".\n- If the input is valid, we return the result of adding `bump` hours to the original datetime.\n- Finally, we call our function on a DateTime object and print out the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,237],"elapsed":2.05496019,"_type":"aimessage"}]
