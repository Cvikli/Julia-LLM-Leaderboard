The default value for bump is set to 3. If you pass an argument other than Integer or DateTime to the function, an error will be thrown.\n\nThe second function `timezone_bumper` throws an ArgumentError if you try to call it with a Date object.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that you are using Julia's built-in DateTime and Date types. If you are using other packages such as TimeZone or Dates.jl, the solution might be different.","status":200,"tokens":[0,275],"elapsed":2.342964241,"_type":"aimessage"}]
