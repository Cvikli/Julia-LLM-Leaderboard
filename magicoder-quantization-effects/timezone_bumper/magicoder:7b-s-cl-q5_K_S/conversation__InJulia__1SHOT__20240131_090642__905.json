The second argument, `bump` (defaulting to 3), is how many hours to add to the timestamp. If `dt` is not a DateTime type, an error is thrown. Otherwise, it returns the new DateTime after adding the specified number of hours.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\njulia> dt = now()\n2021-03-18T14:57:59.623\n\njulia> timezone_bumper(dt)\n2021-03-18T17:57:59.623\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,249],"elapsed":2.141623369,"_type":"aimessage"}]
