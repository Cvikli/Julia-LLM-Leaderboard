It first checks if `dt` is of type `DateTime`. If it's not, an error is thrown. Then it adds `bump` hours to `dt` and returns the result.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(2022, 1, 1, 12)\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt)\nprintln(bumped_dt) # Outputs: 2022-01-01T15:00:00\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,230],"elapsed":1.980619964,"_type":"aimessage"}]
