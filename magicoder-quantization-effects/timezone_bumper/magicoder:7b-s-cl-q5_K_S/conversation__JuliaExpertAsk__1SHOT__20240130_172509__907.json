It simply adds the hours specified by bump to the provided DateTime. Note that this works only with DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\nFor example, if you call `timezone_bumper(now())`, it will increase the time of the current DateTime object by 3 hours. If you want to change the number of hours, you can do so by calling something like `timezone_bumper(now(),5)`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,208],"elapsed":1.820214736,"_type":"aimessage"}]
