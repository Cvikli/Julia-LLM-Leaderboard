[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

This function uses the `DateTime` from the Dates package to deal with date/time, and also checks if the input is indeed of type DateTime. It raises an exception when it encounters an error instead of returning an error code. \n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\n\"\"\"\n    timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump::Int = 3)\nIncrease the provided datetime object by 'bump' hours. Default is 3 if not specified. \nThis function only works with DateTime type and throws an error for Date types.\n\"\"\"\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump::Int = 3)\n    # Check if dt is of DateTime type, else throw exception\n    if typeof(dt) != DateTime\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be of DateTime type\"))\n    end\n    \n    # Increase the datetime by 'bump' hours\n    bumped_dt = dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\n    return bumped_dt\nend\n```\n\nHere is a usage example: \n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\n# Create DateTime object\ndt = now()\n\n# Increase timezone by 3 hours\nnew_datetime = timezone_bumper(dt)\nprintln(\"New date and time after bumping timezone by +3 hours is : $(new_datetime)\")\n```\n\nIn the above example, `now()` function returns the current DateTime in your local system. We are passing it to the `timezone_bumper` function which increases the timezone of the datetime object by 3 hours.\n\nFor any special instructions you may have, such as the need for the timestamp to be rounded to a specific hour or minute interval, this can be easily achieved by modifying the logic inside the `timezone_bumper` function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,416],"elapsed":3.655169455,"_type":"aimessage"}]
