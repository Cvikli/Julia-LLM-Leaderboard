[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump=3)\n    error(\"Can't apply timezone bump on Date type.\")\nend\n```\n\nIn the above code:\n- `Dates` is a standard library in Julia that provides functions for dealing with dates and times.\n- `DateTime` and `Date` are types from Dates library, representing date and time respectively.\n- `Hour(bump)` is an instance of `TimePeriod`, which represents a duration. Here it's used to increase the given DateTime by bump hours.\n- A function named `timezone_bumper` is defined that takes a DateTime and an optional Int parameter (defaulting to 3). It returns the result of adding the bump amount to the input DateTime.\n- Another function named `timezone_bumper` is defined for Date type, with same parameters but throws an error if it's called with a Date type as argument.\n\nPlease note that this function will increase the timezone by +3 hours irrespective of the timezone from where the date/time is taken. If you want to adjust timezone based on location, then you might need to use third-party libraries like `TimeZoneDatabase` or `TzDatabase`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,316],"elapsed":2.769340821,"_type":"aimessage"}]
