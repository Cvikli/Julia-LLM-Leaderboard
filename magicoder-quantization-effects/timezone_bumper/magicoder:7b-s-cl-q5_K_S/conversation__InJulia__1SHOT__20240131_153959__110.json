Please use DateTime instead.\")\nend\n```\nIn this code, `timezone_bumper` is a function that takes in two arguments: `dt`, which is the date-time to be modified and `bump`, which is an integer representing how many hours you want to add to the time. If no `bump` value is provided, it defaults to 3 hours.\n\nThe first function checks if the input type is DateTime. If it is, it adds the number of hours specified by `bump` to the date-time and returns the result.\n\nThe second function checks if the input type is Date. If it is, it throws an error saying that this function does not support Date types.","status":200,"tokens":[0,225],"elapsed":1.913707764,"_type":"aimessage"}]
