Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is an implementation of the problem in Julia using `ThreadsX` package for multithreading:\n\n```julia\nusing ThreadsX\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    results = Vector{Union{Nothing, String}}(nothing, length(words))\n    function transform_word(index)\n        word = words[index]\n        if isempty(word) || (first(word) == 'a' && length(word) > 1 && lowercase(last(word)) == 'y')\n            results[index] = word\n        else\n            results[index] = string(word[2:end], word[1]) * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n    ThreadsX.map((i)->transform_word(i), 1:length(words))\n    return filter(!isnothing, results)\nend\n```\nThis function first initializes an array to store the transformed words with nothing (null in Julia). It then defines a nested function `transform_word` that takes an index of an element from the input vector and transforms it into pig latin. This function modifies the corresponding entry in the results array. Finally, we use `ThreadsX.map()` to apply this transformation to each word concurrently using multiple threads. After all words are transformed, we filter out the entries that remain as nothing (null in Julia) and return the resultant vector of transformed words. \nPlease install ThreadsX package by running `Pkg.add(\"ThreadsX\")` before running above code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,341],"elapsed":2.549869439,"_type":"aimessage"}]
