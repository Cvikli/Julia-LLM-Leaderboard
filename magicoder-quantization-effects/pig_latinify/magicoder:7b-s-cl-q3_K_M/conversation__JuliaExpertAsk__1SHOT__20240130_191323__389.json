It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use the Julia language's parallel computing capabilities to achieve this. Here is an example of how you could implement `pig_latinify` using Julia's multi-threading functionality:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    num_threads = Threads.nthreads()\n    words_per_thread = ceil(Int, length(words) / num_threads)\n    @sync begin\n        for i in 1:num_threads\n            let words = words[i*words_per_thread:(i+1)*words_per_thread]\n                Threads.spawn() do\n                    pig_latinify(words)\n                end\n            end\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(word::AbstractString)\n    vowels = [\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"]\n    isuppercase(c::Char) = 'A' <= c < 'a' || c in ['E', 'I', 'O', 'U'] \n    word = replace(lowercase(word), vowel => uppercasefirst(vowel) for vowel in vowels) * \"ay\"\nend\n```\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function will transform each string in the input vector to pig latin, while creating a separate thread for each transformation. The helper function `pig_latinify` is defined to perform this transformation on an individual string.\n\nPlease note that in real-world scenarios you would probably want to consider the case sensitivity and other special characters in your strings as well, which are not considered here for simplicity's sake.","status":200,"tokens":[142,381],"elapsed":14.893920946,"_type":"aimessage"}]
