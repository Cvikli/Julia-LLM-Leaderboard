Also `Distributed`, and `Transformers` are imported for parallel processing and threading support respectively.\n\nThis code defines two functions:\n1) `pig_latinify(str)` - a single string pig latin transformation.\n2) `pig_latinify_vector(strings::AbstractVector{<:AbstractString})` - vector of strings transformer. It uses `Threads.mmap` function to iterate over each element in the vector and runs it on different threads using `@async`.\n\nYou can call this function like so: \n```julia\nstrings = [\"apple\", \"orange\", \"banana\"]\npig_latinify_vector(strings)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,367],"elapsed":2.870142083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
