[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The problem requires creating an asynchronous program in Julia that translates English words into Pig Latin. In the Pig Latin language, we move the first consonant or consonant cluster of each word to the end and add \"ay\" to it. If a word starts with vowel sounds like \"e\", \"y\", \"o\" etc., just add \"ay\".\n\nHere's an example of how to solve this:\n```julia\nusing Unicode\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    results = asyncmap((w) -> begin\n        first = w[1] == ' ' ? \"\" : w[1]\n        rest  = length(w) > 1 ? string(w[2:end]) : \"\"\n        islowercase(first) && return first * \"ay\" * rest\n        return string(rest, first, \"ay\")\n    end, words; threads=true) |> fetch\n    return results\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `asyncmap` function to apply the transformation asynchronously to each word. The result is then fetched using the `fetch` function.\n\nTo use this function, you could do something like:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\"]\npiglatin_words = pig_latinify(words)\nforeach(println, piglatin_words)\n```\nThis will print the Pig Latin versions of each word in `words`.","status":200,"tokens":[403,326],"elapsed":17.35036467,"_type":"aimessage"}]
