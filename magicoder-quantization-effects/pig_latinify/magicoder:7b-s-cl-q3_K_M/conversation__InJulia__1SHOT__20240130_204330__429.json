It then uses Julia's `@spawnat :any` macro to distribute this transformation over multiple threads.\n\nPlease replace `\"your-data.jl\"` with your actual data file name. The `@load` macro is used to load a data array from a saved `.jl` file. You can save your data array using the `save(\"your-data.jl\", data)` function in Julia. \n\nRemember that this solution assumes that you have already partitioned your data into chunks that are suitable for processing by multiple threads.","status":200,"tokens":[0,474],"elapsed":3.574516589,"_type":"aimessage"}]
