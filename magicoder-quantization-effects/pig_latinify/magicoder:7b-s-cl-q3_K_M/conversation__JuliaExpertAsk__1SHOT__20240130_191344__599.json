However, Julia's standard library does not include a built-in way to create threads from scratch. You would typically use a package like `ThreadsX` for that. \n\nLet's assume we have such a package installed. Here is how you can write the function:\n\n```julia\nusing ThreadsX\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    # Create an empty vector to store results from each thread\n    results = Vector{Union{}}()\n\n    @threads for string in strings\n        push!(results, pig_latinify(string))\n    end\n    \n    return results\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(s::String)\n    # Your function to convert a string into Pig Latin\n    # Here is an example:\n    words = split(s)  # Split the string into words\n    first_letter = words[1][1]  # Get the first letter of the word\n    rest_of_word = words[1][2:end]  # Everything else in the word\n    \n    return \"$rest_of_word$first_letteray\"  # Join the rest with the first letter and add \"ay\" at the end\nend\n```\nPlease note that this example function does not work as a stand-alone Pig Latin translator. It just shows how you can use `Threads.@threads` macro and iterate over vector of strings in different threads. Your actual implementation of pig latin function would need to be adjusted according to your specific requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,363],"elapsed":2.854561477,"_type":"aimessage"}]
