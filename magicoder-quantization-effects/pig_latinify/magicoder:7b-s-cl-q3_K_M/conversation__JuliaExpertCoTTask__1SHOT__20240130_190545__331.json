[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this task using the Julia programming language with parallel computing capabilities. Here is a solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)\n    function shift_word(word)\n        first = split(word, '')[1]\n        return string(first, word[2:end], \"ay\")\n    end\n    \n    # Create a Threads.Task for each word in the vector\n    tasks = [Threads.@spawn shift_word(string) for string in strings]\n\n    # Retrieve results from each thread\n    results = fetch.(tasks)\n\n    return results\nend\n\nprintln(pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]))\n```\n\nThis program creates a function `shift_word` which takes a word and moves the first letter to the end with an \"ay\" suffix.\n\nThen it uses a loop to create a new task for each string in the input vector, and fetches all of these tasks. These tasks run concurrently on separate threads thanks to Julia's `Threads.@spawn` macro.\n\nFinally, it prints out the resultant pig latin words.","status":200,"tokens":[0,265],"elapsed":2.052516232,"_type":"aimessage"}]
