To create such function we will use the `Threads` package in Julia.\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strs::Vector{String})\n    # Create an empty vector to store results\n    result = fill(\"\", length(strs))\n\n    @threads for i in 1:length(strs)\n        str = strs[i]\n        result[i] = pig_latin_transform(str)\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_transform(str::String)\n    # Split the string into words\n    words = split(str, ' ')\n    \n    # Transform each word and join them back together with spaces\n    transformed_words = [pig_latin_word(w) for w in words]\n    return join(transformed_words, ' ')\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_word(word::String)\n    # Pig Latin rules:\n    # 1. If a word starts with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), move it to the end of the word and add \"ay\"\n    # 2. If a word starts with any other consonant, move it to the end of the word and add \"ay\" unless the word is only one letter long\n    vowels = [\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"]\n    \n    first_letter = lowercase(word[1])\n    if first_letter in vowels || length(word) == 1\n        return string(word, \"ay\")\n    else\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n```\nPlease note that the `pig_latinify` function will not preserve original strings' case, as pig latin is a noun-based language. For preserving the casing of words you can use some different approach.","status":200,"tokens":[0,462],"elapsed":3.629700211,"_type":"aimessage"}]
