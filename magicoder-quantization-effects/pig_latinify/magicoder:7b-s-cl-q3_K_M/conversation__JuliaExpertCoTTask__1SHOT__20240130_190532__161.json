Once all tasks are completed, it appends the results to an output list, which is returned by the `pig_latinify` function.\n\nYou can call this function like so:\n```python\nprint(pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]))  # Outputs ['elloway', 'applepay', 'ongstrugsay', 'orldway']\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,302],"elapsed":2.343072975,"_type":"aimessage"}]
