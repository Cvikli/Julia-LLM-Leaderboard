It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation in Julia which uses the built-in `replace` function for strings and list comprehension:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)::Vector{String}\n    # Create an empty vector to store results\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(strings))\n\n    @threads for i in 1:length(strings)\n        # Split the string by spaces to get words\n        words = split(strings[i], ' ')\n        \n        # Convert each word and join them back together with spaces\n        result[i] = join([pig_latinify_word(w) for w in words], ' ')\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_word(word::String)::String\n    # Check if the word starts with a vowel or consonant. If it's a vowel, append \"ay\" to it. If it's a consonant, move it to the end and append \"ay\".\n    if islowercase(word[1]) && in(\"aeiou\", lowercase(first(word)))\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    elseif isuppercase(word[1]) && in(\"AEIOU\", first(word))\n        return uppercase(word) * \"AY\"\n    else \n        # For consonant starting words\n        return join([ch for ch in reverse(word)], '') * 'a' * 'y'\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function transforms each word of the input string to pig latin. The `pig_latinify_word` helper function takes a single word and returns its pig latin equivalent. This function uses threads so that each transformation can run on a separate thread.","status":200,"tokens":[0,399],"elapsed":2.995287349,"_type":"aimessage"}]
