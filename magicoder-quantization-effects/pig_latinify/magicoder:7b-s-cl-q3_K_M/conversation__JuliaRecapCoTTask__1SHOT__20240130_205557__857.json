[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

This means that each iteration of the loop will be run in its own thread. We then split the input string into words with `split(strs[i])`, add \"ay\" to the end of each word with `.* \"ay\"` and reverse the resulting list of words with `reverse(words)`. Finally, we join all pig latin words into a sentence with `join(piglatin_words, \" \")`.\n\nYou can call this function by providing it with an array of strings:\n```julia\nstrs = [\"hello\", \"world\"]\nresult = pig_latinify(strs)\nprintln.(result)\n```\nThe expected output would be:\n```\nellohay orldway\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,352],"elapsed":2.72599,"_type":"aimessage"}]
