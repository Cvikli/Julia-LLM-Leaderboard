This is done using the `*` operator for string concatenation. The `for i in 1:length(strs)` loop iterates over each word in the input array of strings. `@async begin...end` creates an asynchronous task which modifies a copy of the string (i.e., it doesn't modify the original array directly).\n\nPlease note that in Julia, strings are immutable, so we can't change elements in place like you would do with mutable types. Therefore, each thread creates its own local copy of the word and changes this copy. These copies are then discarded after the task has completed. Thus, there is no need to handle any concurrency or synchronization issues.\n  \nRunning the above code with input [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"] would return [\"ellohay\", \"appleyay\", \"rongpay\", \"orldpay\"].","status":200,"tokens":[230,364],"elapsed":15.393972071,"_type":"aimessage"}]
