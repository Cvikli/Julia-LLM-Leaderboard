Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\nimport time\nfrom multiprocessing import Pool, cpu_count\nimport functools\n\ndef pig_latinify(word):\n    word = word[1:] + word[0] + \"ay\" if len(word) > 0 else ''\n    return word\n\ndef applyParallel(words, fn):\n    with Pool(cpu_count()) as p:\n        return p.map(functools.partial(fn), words)\n\ndef applySerial(words, fn):\n    for word in words:\n        print(fn(word))\n\n# Test the function\nwords = [\"apple\", \"orange\", \"banana\"]\nstart_time = time.time()\napplyParallel(words, pig_latinify)\nend_time = time.time()\nprint(\"Execution took %.2f sec\" % (end_time - start_time))\n```\nThis code defines a function that changes English words to Pig Latin and applies it in parallel for multiple words. It uses Python's multiprocessing library to create multiple threads.\n\nNote: This implementation is using Pool.map() which spawns processes, not threads. The difference being that each process spawned by Pool.map() runs in a separate memory space. Thus, the shared state between them is limited and should be safe. But keep in mind that it's not recommended to use this approach for CPU-bound tasks.\n\nPlease replace \"apple\", \"orange\" and \"banana\" with your actual list of strings if you are using a different set.","status":200,"tokens":[0,359],"elapsed":2.741732563,"_type":"aimessage"}]
