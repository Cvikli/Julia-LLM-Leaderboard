It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can achieve this using Julia's multi-threading capabilities with the `@parallel` macro:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)\n    @parallel for s in strings\n        # Split the string into words and reverse each word but not the first one.\n        words = split(s, ' ')\n        firstword = popfirst!(words)\n        restofwords = words[1:end]\n        \n        # Combine all the reversed words back together with spaces in between.\n        new_string = join([reverse(word) * \"ay\" for word in restofwords]..., ' ', firstword)\n    end\nend\n```\nPlease note that you need to define `popfirst!` function for popping and modifying the first element of an array at the same time. Below is a sample implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction popfirst!(array::Array{T,1}) where {T}\n    if length(array) == 0\n        error(\"Cannot pop from empty array\")\n    end\n    return array[end], splice!(array, 1, 1)\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,261],"elapsed":1.92320642,"_type":"aimessage"}]
