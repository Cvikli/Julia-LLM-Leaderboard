The helper function `translate` is defined to convert each input string into Pig Latin. Then, the map method of the executor object is used to apply this function to every string in the input list. Finally, the results are returned as a list.\n\nThis solution is concise and efficient, as it uses multithreading for concurrent processing, making the code run faster on multi-core machines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,297],"elapsed":2.273909976,"_type":"aimessage"}]
