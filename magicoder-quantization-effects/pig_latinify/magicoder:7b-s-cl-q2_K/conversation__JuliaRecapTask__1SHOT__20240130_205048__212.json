[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The result is then returned as an array of integers, where each integer represents the number of seconds (with leading zeroes) after which a word was found in the list of words to be translated into pig latin. \n\nIn the function `shift`, we shift letters based on their positions in the alphabet, taking into account whether they are vowels or not. If there is no vowel at position 1 (i.e., it is a consonant), we shift it back to the end of the word. If there is a vowel before that position, we shift it there. \n\nPlease note, due to limitations in the text representation of integers with leading zeroes and the specifics of how Julia handles threading, it's not guaranteed that these will be accurate as expected. The exact output may vary based on the order of operations due to parallelism.","status":200,"tokens":[0,527],"elapsed":4.054319906,"_type":"aimessage"}]
