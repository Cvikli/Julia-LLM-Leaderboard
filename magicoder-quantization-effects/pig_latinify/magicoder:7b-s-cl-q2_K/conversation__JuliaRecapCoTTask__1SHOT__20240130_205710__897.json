[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem using Julia's multithreading capabilities. Below is the code for the `pig_latinify` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)\n    @sync begin\n        for i in eachindex(strings)\n            @spawn onerror=resume try \n                strings[i] = pig_latinify_single(strings[i])\n            catch e \n                println(\"Caught an error: $(e)\")\n            end\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, the function `pig_latinify_single` is applied to each string in parallel using Julia's multithreading and asynchronous processing capabilities. If there are any errors during this process, it will catch them and continue with the next string.\n\nHere's a simple example of how you might define `pig_latinify_single`:\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify_single(str::AbstractString) \n    str_split = split(str, ' ')\n    new_str_split = map(str_split) do word\n        first_letter = first(word)\n        rest_of_word = word[2:end] * \"ay\"\n        lowercase(first_letter) * rest_of_word\n    end\n    return join(new_str_split, ' ')\nend \n```\n\nThis function splits the string into individual words and then processes each one. It takes a word from pig Latin and puts it back together with the \"ay\" at the end to form the new word. The resulting words are then joined back into a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[406,375],"elapsed":16.248585699,"_type":"aimessage"}]
