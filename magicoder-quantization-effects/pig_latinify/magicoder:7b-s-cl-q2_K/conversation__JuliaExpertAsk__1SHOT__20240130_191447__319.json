However, for this example let's assume that we are working with a hypothetical `MultiThreadingJulia` programming language where multi-threading would work.\n\nHere's an example of how you could implement it:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(str_vec)\n    @threads for str in str_vec\n        pig_latin(str)\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(str)\n    words = split(str)\n    words = map(words) do word\n       if islowercase(first(word))\n           word * \"ay\"\n       else\n           capitalize(word[2:end]) * word[1] * \"ay\"\n       end\n    end\n    return join(words, ' ')\nend\n```\n\nPlease note that this code isn't truly running because we don't have the Julia programming language. However, you should be able to understand the general idea. We define a function `pig_latinify` which iterates over each string in the input vector and applies the `pig_latin` function to it. The `pig_latin` function translates an individual word into pig Latin. The operations are multithreaded so that they can be performed concurrently.\n\nPlease make sure you've installed Julia before running this code, if not you could install it via your package manager (apt, yum, etc). \n\nFinally, remember that Python is often a better choice for such tasks due to its simplicity and extensive standard library.","status":200,"tokens":[0,386],"elapsed":2.911999184,"_type":"aimessage"}]
