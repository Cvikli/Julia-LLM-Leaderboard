[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"First, let's define what we mean by Pig Latin:\n- If the word begins with a consonant, take the rest of the word and add \"ay\". So you'd take \"hello\" and turn it into \"ellohay\", as in English \"take the rest of the word after the first letter (e.g., \"hello\") and append it to form a new word.\"\n- If the word begins with a vowel, move the initial consonant(s) to the end and add \"ay\". So you'd take \"apple\" and turn it into \"appleqay\", as in English \"move the first consonant(s) to the end of the word.\"\n\nHere is an example code for a `pig_latinify` function. This function will convert each string in the input list to pig Latin. It uses multiple dispatch (generics and abstract types) for different types of inputs:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify{T}(input::Vector{T}) where {T<:AbstractString}\n    # Create a channel that will be shared by the worker tasks\n    c = Channel(100)\n\n    function worker()\n        while !isempty(c)\n            item = take!(c)\n            put!(pig_latinify(item))\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Create a separate task for each worker (to avoid blocking the main thread)\n    for _ in 1:min(Threads.nthreads(), length(input))\n        Threads.threadid_current() do id; put!(c, input[id]); end\n    end\n\n    # Wait for all tasks to finish before returning\n    wait(c)\nend\n```\n\nPlease note that this function assumes a certain level of Julia proficiency and may not run as expected for people unfamiliar with the language.","status":200,"tokens":[0,416],"elapsed":3.178784639,"_type":"aimessage"}]
