[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function transforms an individual string into pig latin. It first splits the input string into words, then iterates over these words applying the `pig_latin_word` function to each word.\nThe `pig_latin_word` function checks if a word starts with lowercase letter (excluding 'I') and has more than one character, and if so it transforms this word into pig latin by moving the first character to the end followed by \"_ay\". If a word is uppercase or starts with an 'I', it remains the same.\n\nPlease provide instructions for customization, if any, in terms of parallelizing the execution of `pig_latinify` function over multiple threads.","status":200,"tokens":[0,417],"elapsed":3.178943669,"_type":"aimessage"}]
