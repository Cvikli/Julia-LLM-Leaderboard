Each thread takes an item off of the queue, translates it into pig latin (either using the regular way or the words' order swapped), and then prints out the result along with its original index.\n\nWe assume that there are four threads, so each word will be translated by one of these threads. After all work is done, each thread puts None onto the queue to signal it's time to quit.","status":200,"tokens":[0,433],"elapsed":3.389254143,"_type":"aimessage"}]
