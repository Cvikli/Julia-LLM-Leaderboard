[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

This code uses multithreading to speed up the translation process:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    threads = Threads.@threads for word in words\n        pig_latinified_word = pig_latin_transform(word)\n        println(\"Pig Latinified word is: \", pig_latinified_word)\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_transform(word::String)\n    # Split the string into words\n    split_word = split(word, ' ')\n    \n    if length(split_word) > 1\n        return \"Invalid input.

This function uses Julia's `@threads` macro, which automatically partitions the workload among all available threads in your CPU and executes each part concurrently. \n\nEach thread then calls the `pig_latin_transform` function on a different word from the input vector. The `pig_latin_transform` function transforms a single string into pig latin (moving the first letter of the string to the end and adding 'ay').","status":200,"tokens":[0,366],"elapsed":3.235645318,"_type":"aimessage"}]
