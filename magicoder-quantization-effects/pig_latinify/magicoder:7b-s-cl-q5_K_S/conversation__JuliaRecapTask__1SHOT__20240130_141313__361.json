[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin.

The `@sync begin ... end` block is used to create a synchronous scope, and the inner loop `@async println(word * \"ay\")` creates an asynchronous task for each string in the array.\n\nThis implementation does not guarantee the order of output since it uses async tasks (also known as coroutines or green threads), which allow for concurrent execution. However, Julia guarantees that all synchronous tasks will finish before continuing on with asynchronous tasks. This means that this function should work correctly even if you call it with a very large vector of words.\n\nYou could also use the `Base.Threads.@threads` macro to parallelize over the elements of an array, although keep in mind that this has some additional overhead and is less efficient than using async tasks:\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    @threads for word in words\n        println(word * \"ay\")\n    end\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,312],"elapsed":2.746450978,"_type":"aimessage"}]
