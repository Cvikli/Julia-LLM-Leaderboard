It then uses Python's concurrent.futures module to apply the `convert_to_piglatin` function to each string in parallel using threads. The result is a list of pig latin translations.\n\nThe `convert_to_piglatin` function checks if the first letter of the input string is a vowel, and if so, appends \"way\" to it; otherwise, it moves all consonants to the end of the word and adds \"ay\". This is the standard pig latin rule.\n\nWhen you run this script with the list `[\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]`, it will print out the following: \n`['ellohay', 'appleyay', 'rongstray', 'orldway']`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,355],"elapsed":3.03579708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
