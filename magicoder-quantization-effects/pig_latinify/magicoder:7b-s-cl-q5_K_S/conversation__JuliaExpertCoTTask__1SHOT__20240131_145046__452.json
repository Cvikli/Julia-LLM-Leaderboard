It then uses `@distributed` to run this function on each element of the input array in parallel. The result is a vector of transformed strings, with each transformation done in its own thread.\n\nWhen you run this script with your example data, it will return: \n\n```julia\n[\"ellohay\", \"appleyay\", \"strongway\", \"orldway\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,229],"elapsed":1.948657883,"_type":"aimessage"}]
