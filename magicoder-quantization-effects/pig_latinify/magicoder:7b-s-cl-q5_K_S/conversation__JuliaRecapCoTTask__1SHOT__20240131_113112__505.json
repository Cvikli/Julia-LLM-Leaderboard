[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia code for solving this task:\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String}, instructions...)\n    @sync begin\n        for word in words\n            @async begin\n                println(pig_latin(word, instructions...))\n            end\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word::AbstractString, instructions...)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    if first_letter in vowels\n        return string(first_letter * \"ay\")\n    else\n        return string(word[2:end, :]*\"ay\", first_letter)\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this code, the `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings and any number of instructions as arguments. It uses `@sync begin ... @async begin ... end` to create threads for each word in the input vector. The `pig_latin` function is used inside the thread to convert each word into pig latin.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function checks if the first letter of the word is a vowel. If it is, it appends \"ay\" at the end of the word and returns it. Otherwise, it moves all letters except for the first one to the end of the word and adds \"ay\" at the beginning.\n\nThe instructions are passed as additional arguments to `pig_latin` function but not used in this solution because the problem doesn't specify how these instructions should be applied on each word. If you want to use these instructions, please provide more details about the instructions and their expected format.","status":200,"tokens":[0,379],"elapsed":3.298138647,"_type":"aimessage"}]
