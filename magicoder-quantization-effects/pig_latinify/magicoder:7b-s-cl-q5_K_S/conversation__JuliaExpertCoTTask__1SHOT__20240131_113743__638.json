If the first letter of the word is a vowel, it appends 'way' to the end of the word. Otherwise, it moves the first letter to the end of the word and adds 'ay'.\n\nThe function `pig_latinify_vector` takes in a list of words and applies `pig_latinify` to each one using multithreading. It uses the `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` class, which creates a pool of threads that can all run tasks simultaneously. The `map` function applies the `pig_latinify` function to every element in the input list and returns a list of results.\n\nWhen you call `pig_latinify_vector`, it prints out the pig latin versions of the words:\n```python\n['ellohay', 'appleway', 'strongray', 'orldway']\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,392],"elapsed":3.356177845,"_type":"aimessage"}]
