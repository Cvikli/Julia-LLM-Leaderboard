It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia code for `pig_latinify`:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n@everywhere function pig_latinify(words)\n    @sync for word in words\n        @async println(pig_latin(word))\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word::AbstractString)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    firstletter = word[1]\n    restofword = word[2:end]\n    \n    if !(firstletter in vowels)\n        return string(restofword, firstletter, \"ay\")\n    else\n        return string(word * \"ay\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, we define a function `pig_latinify` that takes an array of words as its argument. It uses `@sync for word in words` to iterate over each word on a separate thread using `@async`. For each word, it calls the `pig_latin` function which checks if the first letter is a vowel or not and converts the word accordingly.\n\nThe `@everywhere` macro is used to ensure that the `pig_latin` function is available on all workers for parallel execution. The `@sync for word in words` loop ensures that the threads are synchronized properly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,304],"elapsed":2.584442325,"_type":"aimessage"}]
