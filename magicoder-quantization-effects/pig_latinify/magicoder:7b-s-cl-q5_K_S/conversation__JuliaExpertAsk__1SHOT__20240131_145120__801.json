Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could implement the `pig_latinify` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    @sync for word in words\n        @spawn if !isempty(word)\n            # Split the word by spaces and convert each part to pig latin\n            parts = split(word, \" \")\n            pig_latin_parts = [pig_latin(part) for part in parts]\n            \n            # Join the parts back together with spaces\n            result = join(pig_latin_parts, \" \")\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word::AbstractString)\n    word = lowercase(word)\n    \n    if first(word) in vowels\n        return string(word*\"ay\")\n    else\n        return string(word[2:end]*\"ay\", word[1])\n    end\nend\n\nvowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n```\nThis program defines a function `pig_latinify` that takes in a vector of words and converts each one to pig latin. It does this by creating a new thread for each word, where the transformation is performed.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function is used within `pig_latinify` to convert individual words into their Pig Latin equivalents. This function uses recursion to handle the case when a single word contains multiple spaces (i.e., it splits the word by spaces and converts each part separately).\n\nIt's important to note that this is an overly simplified implementation of pig latin, and real-world usage would require more complex logic for handling punctuation and capitalization.","status":200,"tokens":[0,403],"elapsed":3.428067787,"_type":"aimessage"}]
