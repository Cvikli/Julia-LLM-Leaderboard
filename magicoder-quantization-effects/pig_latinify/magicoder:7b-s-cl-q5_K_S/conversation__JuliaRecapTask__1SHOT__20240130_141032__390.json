[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is the code which can be used for the above problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n@everywhere begin \n    function pig_latinify(word::AbstractString)\n        first_letter = word[1]\n        if occursin(r\"^[aeiou]\", lowercase(first_letter))\n            return \"$(lowercase(word))ay\"\n        else\n            return string(word[2:end], first_letter, \"ay\")\n        end\n    end\n    \n    function pig_latinify_vector(words::AbstractArray{T, 1}) where {T <: AbstractString}\n        results = Array{Any}(undef, length(words))\n        @sync for (i, word) in enumerate(words)\n            results[i] = @distributed pig_latinify(word)\n        end\n        return results\n    end\nend\n``` \nThis code will define a `pig_latinify` function that transforms an input string into Pig Latin. It checks if the first letter is a vowel, and if it is, adds \"ay\" to the end. If not, it moves all letters after the first one and puts them before the first character, then adds \"ay\".\n\nThen `pig_latinify_vector` function creates a new array of results using multiple threads for each word in the input array. The `@distributed` macro tells Julia to run this code on a worker process if possible (i.e., when there are more than one workers). \n\nYou can use `pig_latinify` and `pig_latinify_vector` as follows:\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\nprintln.(pig_latinify_vector(words))\n```\nThis will print out the Pig Latin versions of each word in the array. The `.` after `println` is used to call `println` on every element of the returned array, which makes it print each transformed word on a separate line.","status":200,"tokens":[369,462],"elapsed":4.135351275,"_type":"aimessage"}]
