The helper function `_pig_latinify` checks if the first character of a word is a letter (not punctuation or digit), and if it is, moves the letter to the end and adds 'ay'. Otherwise, it keeps the original word as it is not a valid English word.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n```julia\nstrings = [\"hello\", \"world\"]\nresult = pig_latinify(strings)\nprintln.(result)\n```\nThis will print: \n`ellohay orldway`","status":200,"tokens":[0,423],"elapsed":3.592923131,"_type":"aimessage"}]
