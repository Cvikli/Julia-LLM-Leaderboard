It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can solve this problem using Julia's parallel computing capabilities. For simplicity, we assume all words in the input list are separated by spaces (and not punctuation), and that all words start with an alphabet letter:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    @sync begin\n        for word in words\n            @async begin\n                if isempty(word) || !isascii(word)\n                    continue\n                end\n                first = word[1]\n                rest = word[2:end] * first * \"ay\"\n                println(\"$rest-ay\")\n            end\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function takes a list of words as input, and for each word, it creates a new thread to perform the pig latin transformation. The `@sync` macro ensures that all tasks are executed in parallel. In the `begin`-`end` block, there's an implicit loop over every element in `words`.\n\nNow, you can call this function with your list of words like so: \n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"orange\", \"grape\"]\npig_latinify(words)\n```\n\nThis will print the pig latin versions of each word on a new line. Please note that the parallel processing might be slower than sequential for small inputs due to overheads associated with thread creation and management in Julia, but it can be very efficient when dealing with large amounts of data.","status":200,"tokens":[0,336],"elapsed":2.88803105,"_type":"aimessage"}]
