[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin.

The `for word in words` loop is run on separate threads thanks to Julia's multithreading capabilities.\n\nIf you call this function with an array of words, it will convert each one into Pig Latin:\n\n```julia\npig_latinify([\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"])\n```\nThis script assumes that the input is an array of strings and prints out the results. If you want to modify this script so that it returns a new vector containing the Pig Latin words, then you can do so by creating a new vector `piglatin_words` and adding each word to it inside the loop:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::AbstractVector{<:AbstractString})::AbstractVector{<:AbstractString}\n    piglatin_words = String[]\n    @showprogress \"Converting to Pig Latin...\" for word in words\n        if first(word) isalpha()\n            upper = uppercasefirst(word)\n            rest = lowercase(word[2:end]) * \"ay\"\n            push!(piglatin_words, \"$upper-$rest\")\n        else\n            push!(piglatin_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return piglatin_words\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,433],"elapsed":3.858590758,"_type":"aimessage"}]
