It uses Julia's threading feature (`Threads.@threads`) to parallelize the transformation across multiple threads. \n\nIn Pig Latin, we move the first consonant or consonant cluster (considered as a single unit) of an English word to the end and add \"ay\". If the word starts with a vowel, we simply add \"ay\" at the end. \n\nThe `pig_latin_word` function does this transformation for each word individually, returning the transformed version. The `println` function is used to print out the transformed words.","status":200,"tokens":[0,340],"elapsed":2.931307882,"_type":"aimessage"}]
