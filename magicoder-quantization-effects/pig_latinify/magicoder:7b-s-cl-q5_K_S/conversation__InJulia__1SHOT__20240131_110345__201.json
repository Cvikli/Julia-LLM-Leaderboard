The `@sync begin ... end` block ensures that the entire operation is synchronous.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function is then used to convert each word into pig latin. Pig Latin works by moving the first letter to the end of the word and adding \"ay\".\n\nThis code assumes you have Julia installed with the Distributed module, which allows for parallel processing. If you don't have this module, you can install it using `Pkg.add(\"Distributed\")`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,293],"elapsed":2.48101711,"_type":"aimessage"}]
