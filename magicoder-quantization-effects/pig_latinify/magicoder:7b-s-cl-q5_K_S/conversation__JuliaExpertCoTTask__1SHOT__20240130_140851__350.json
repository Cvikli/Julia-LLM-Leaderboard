It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem, we can use Python's threading library to create threads for each string in the vector. We will follow these steps:\n\n1. Define a function `pig_latinify` that takes a single word as input and translates it into pig latin. \n2. Use a lock (`threading.Lock`) to ensure thread-safety when printing each result on the console.\n3. For each string in the vector, create a new thread which will call `pig_latinify` with that string as argument.\n4. To keep our program from exiting before all threads have finished, we can use the `join()` method for each of them.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport threading\n\ndef pig_latinify(word):\n    \"\"\"Translates a word into Pig Latin.\"\"\"\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    \n    if word[0].lower() in vowels:\n        return f\"{word}way\"\n    else:\n        return f\"{word[1:]}{word[0]}ay\"\n\ndef process_words(words, lock):\n    \"\"\"Translates the given words into Pig Latin.\"\"\"\n    for word in words:\n        with lock:\n            print(pig_latinify(word))\n\nwords = [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]\nlock = threading.Lock()\n\nthreads = []\nfor word in words:\n    t = threading.Thread(target=process_words, args=(word, lock))\n    threads.append(t)\n    t.start()\n\n# Wait for all threads to finish\nfor t in threads:\n    t.join()\n```\n\nNote that this will print the Pig Latin translation of each word on a new line because we are using a lock to ensure thread safety when printing.","status":200,"tokens":[0,439],"elapsed":3.81521309,"_type":"aimessage"}]
