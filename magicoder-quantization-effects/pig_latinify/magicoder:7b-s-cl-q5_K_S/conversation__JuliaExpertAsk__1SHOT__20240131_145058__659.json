The `pig_latin` function is defined elsewhere in this file and used by `pig_latinify`.\n\nPlease note: This code assumes you have Transducers installed in your environment. If not, you can install it using the command `Pkg.add(\"Transducers\")`. The `@everywhere` macro is used to make the function available on all workers (threads).","status":200,"tokens":[0,247],"elapsed":2.090699709,"_type":"aimessage"}]
