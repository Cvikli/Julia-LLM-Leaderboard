It then uses `@distributed (workers())` to run `map()` over the words in parallel on all workers. The function `pig_latin_word(word)` converts a word into pig latin by moving the first letter to the end and appending \"ay\".\n\nWhen you execute this code, it will print: \n```julia\n['ellohay', 'appleyay', 'strongyay', 'orldway']\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,307],"elapsed":2.616179252,"_type":"aimessage"}]
