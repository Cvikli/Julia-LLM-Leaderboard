It applies the `pig_latinify` function to each string in parallel using multiple threads. The `pig_latinify` function converts an individual string into pig latin, which is just the input string with its first letter moved to the end and appended with 'ay'.\n\nNote: Julia uses 1-based indexing and doesn't have a separate list type, so we convert the string to a vector of characters using `collect(word)`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,256],"elapsed":2.208223668,"_type":"aimessage"}]
