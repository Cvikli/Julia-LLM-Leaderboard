The `pig_latin_word` function is used to transform an individual word into pig latin. It checks if the first letter of the word is lowercase, then it moves all letters after the first one to the end and adds \"ay\". If the word starts with a capital letter or only has one character, it simply appends \"ay\" at the end.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\npig_latinify(words)\n```\nThis will print:\n```\nappleyay\nanabaynaay\nerrychay\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,308],"elapsed":2.610994072,"_type":"aimessage"}]
