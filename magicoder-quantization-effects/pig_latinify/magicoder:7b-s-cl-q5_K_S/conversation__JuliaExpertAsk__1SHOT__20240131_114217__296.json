Move the first letter to the end of the word and add 'ay'\n        #                  2. If the word starts with a vowel, just add 'way' at the end\n        if islowercase(first(word)) && !('a':'z' in word)\n            return string(word[2:end], \"way\")\n        elseif isuppercase(first(word)) && !('A':'Z' in word)\n            return uppercase(string(word[2:end], \"Way\"))\n        else\n            return string(word[2:end], \"ay\")\n        end\n    end\nend  # end of @everywhere block\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `pig_latinify` that takes a vector of strings and returns the same vector, but with each word transformed into pig latin. The transformation is done in parallel across multiple threads using Julia's Distributed module.\n\nPlease note that this code needs to be run on a Julia environment which supports multi-threading and distributed computing.","status":200,"tokens":[0,544],"elapsed":4.655828866,"_type":"aimessage"}]
