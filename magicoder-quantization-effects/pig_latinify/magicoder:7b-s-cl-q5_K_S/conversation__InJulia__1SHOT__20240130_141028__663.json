We're creating a thread for each word and applying a function that prefixes each word with \"ay\" to convert it into pig latin. Finally, we use `reduce` to combine all threads into a single output value.\n\nNote: `pmap` is used in conjunction with `@threads`. The `@threads` macro is an extension that allows for parallel execution of code on multiple threads.\n\nHere's how you can call the function:\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\npig_latinify(words)\n```\nThis will output: `[\"appleyay\", \"ananabay\", \"errychay\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,271],"elapsed":2.318378005,"_type":"aimessage"}]
