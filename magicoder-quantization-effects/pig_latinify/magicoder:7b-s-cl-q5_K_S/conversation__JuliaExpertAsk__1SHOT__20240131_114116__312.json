Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem using Julia's multithreading capabilities:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    # Start up the workers\n    addprocs()\n    \n    @everywhere begin\n        function pig_latinify_word(word)\n            vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n            first_letter = word[1]\n            \n            if first_letter in vowels\n                return string(word, \"way\")\n            else\n                return string(word[2:end], first_letter, \"ay\")\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Distribute the work across workers\n    results = @distributed (vcat) for word in words\n        pig_latinify_word(word)\n    end\n    \n    return results\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first creating a new worker process if one isn't already running. Then, it defines the `pig_latinify_word` function on each worker. This function checks whether the first letter of the input string is a vowel. If it is, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word. Otherwise, it moves all letters after the first one to the end and adds the first letter followed by \"ay\". \n\nFinally, it uses `@distributed` to distribute the work across available workers. The result is a vector containing the pig latin versions of each input string. Note that this function assumes that words are separated by spaces and do not contain punctuation.","status":200,"tokens":[0,365],"elapsed":3.097077755,"_type":"aimessage"}]
