Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can do this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n\n    @threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        word = words[i]\n        if islowercase(word[1])\n            result[i] = string(word[2:end], word[1], \"ay\")\n        elseif isuppercase(word[1])\n            result[i] = uppercase(string(word[2:end], word[1], \"ay\"))\n        end\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a vector of strings and transforms each string into pig latin. The `@threads` macro is used to parallelize the operation over different threads. \n\nThe `islowercase` and `isuppercase` functions are used to check if the first character of the word is lower or upper case, respectively. If it's a lowercase letter, we append \"ay\" at the end of the string and move all other characters to the beginning. If it's an uppercase letter, we convert the result back into uppercase before appending \"ay\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,283],"elapsed":2.401183771,"_type":"aimessage"}]
