Each thread translates the word according to pig latin rules and stores the translated word in an array which is then joined back into a string. This allows the function to translate multiple words simultaneously, hence it uses multithreading.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the input vector consists of lowercase English words separated by spaces only. The function also includes simple error handling for unrecognized characters and does not take care of punctuation or numbers in the input. If you need to handle these cases, you would need to expand on the translation rules accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,598],"elapsed":5.198994344,"_type":"aimessage"}]
