Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n@everywhere begin\n    function pig_latinify(str::String)\n        words = split(str, ' ')\n        pig_latin_words = [pig_latin_word(w) for w in words]\n        return join(pig_latin_words, \" \")\n    end\n\n    function pig_latin_word(word::String)\n        if length(word) > 1 && islowercase(first(word))\n            word = reverse(word) * \"-ay\"\n        elseif length(word) > 1 && isuppercase(first(word))\n            word = uppercase(reverse(word)) * \"-AY\"\n        end\n        return word\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_vector(strings::Vector{String})\n    num_threads = min(length(strings), nprocs() - 1) # Use all available threads, minus one for the main thread.\n    results = @distributed (threads=num_threads) [pig_latinify(s) for s in strings]\n    return results\nend\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `pig_latinify` that takes a string and transforms it into pig latin. It then defines another function `pig_latin_word` which operates on each word of the input string to transform it into pig latin. \n\nThe `@everywhere begin ... end` macro is used to define these functions so they can be accessed in a distributed context.\n\nFinally, we have the main function `pig_latinify_vector` which takes a vector of strings and applies the `pig_latinify` function on each string using `@distributed (threads=num_threads)`. This will run each transformation on a separate thread, taking advantage of multithreading capabilities in Julia.\n\nPlease note that this is a simple implementation and may not cover all edge cases or handle different capitalization styles correctly. You might need to adjust the `pig_latin_word` function according to your specific needs.","status":200,"tokens":[0,487],"elapsed":4.191490408,"_type":"aimessage"}]
