[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Then it applies the `pig_latin_word` function on each word in a parallelized way using the `@distributed for` construct from the Julia parallel computing library. It then joins the transformed words back together and returns the result.\n- The second function is applied per word by the first function, which determines whether the word starts with a vowel (if it does, \"way\" is appended to the end; otherwise, we move the last character of the word to the front followed by \"ay\"). \n\nThis code snippet assumes that you have already defined the necessary libraries. If not, Julia's package manager can be used to add them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,481],"elapsed":4.303213062,"_type":"aimessage"}]
