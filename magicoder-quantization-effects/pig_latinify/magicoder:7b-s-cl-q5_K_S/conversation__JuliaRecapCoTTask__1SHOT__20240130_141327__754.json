[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

This code defines the `pig_latinify` function that takes a vector of strings, transforms each string into pig latin and returns a vector with the transformed strings. In order to run it on separate threads, we'll use the `@parallel` macro from Julia's Parallel Computing Toolkit (PTools).\n\nPlease note that this example assumes you have Julia v1.6 or higher installed in your environment.\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\n# Pig Latin Transformer\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    # Regular expression to split words by whitespace and punctuation\n    split_regex = r\"\\s|[.,;!?]\"\n    # Function to convert word into pig latin\n    function to_pig_latin(word)\n        if isempty(word)\n            return \"\"\n        elseif startswith(word, vowel)\n            return \"$(uppercase(word[1]))ay\" * lowercase(word[2:end])\n        else\n            return \"$(uppercase(word[1]))$(word[2:end])$(uppercase(vowel))ay\"\n        end\n    end\n    # Transform each word into pig latin and join them together\n    return reduce((x, y) -> x * \" \" * y, map(to_pig_latin, split(join(words), split_regex)))\nend\n\n# Create a vector of words to transform\nwords = [\"apple\", \"orange\", \"banana\"]\n\n# Start the parallel runtime and run our function on separate threads\n@everywhere begin\n    vowels = Set(['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'])\nend\n@parallel pig_latinify(words)\n```\n\nIn this example, we use `@parallel` to apply `pig_latinify` to each element of `words`. The `@everywhere begin ... end` block is used to define the `vowels` set and the `to_pig_latin` function that transforms words into pig latin.\n\nThe function `pig_latinify(words)` takes a vector of strings, splits each string by whitespace or punctuation using regular expressions, maps over each word to convert it into pig latin (using the defined function), and then joins the transformed words back together into a single string. \n\nPlease replace `{{instructions}}` with your specific instructions if any.","status":200,"tokens":[11,563],"elapsed":5.011844029,"_type":"aimessage"}]
