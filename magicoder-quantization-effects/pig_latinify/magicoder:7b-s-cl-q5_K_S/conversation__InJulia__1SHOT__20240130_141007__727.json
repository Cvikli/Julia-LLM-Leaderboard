Below is an implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    @assert !isempty(words)\n    results = []\n\n    function translate(word::AbstractString)\n        first_letter = word[1]\n        if 'a' <= first_letter <= 'z' \n            return uppercase(first_letter * string(\"ay\")) * word[2:end]\n        elseif 'A' <= first_letter <= 'Z'\n            return lowercase(first_letter * \"ay\") * word[2:end]\n        end\n    end\n\n    @threads for word in words\n        result = translate(word)\n        push!(results, result)\n    end\n\n    return results\nend\n```\nThis function accepts a vector of strings (words), and then translates each string to pig latin. It uses the `@threads` macro for running the translation process on different threads. \n\nIt's important to note that this solution might not be optimal in terms of performance, because the overhead of creating separate threads and synchronization can significantly increase the time it takes to execute the function. However, this solution serves as a simple demonstration of how you could create such function.\n\nFor larger tasks, consider using a parallelized or distributed computing library like DistributedArrays in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[0,316],"elapsed":2.731207279,"_type":"aimessage"}]
