The _pig_latin function takes a string and transforms it into pig latin, by adding 'ay' to the end of the word (followed by the first letter of each subsequent word). The executor map method applies this transformation to every element in the input list, using multiple threads. \n\nPlease note that Python's Global Interpreter Lock(GIL) may not fully utilize multithreading benefits and might be slower than languages like Julia or R which natively support multi-threading.","status":200,"tokens":[230,330],"elapsed":6.093008023,"_type":"aimessage"}]
