Otherwise, take the first letter of the word and put it at the end, then add \"ay\".\n    vowels = [\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"]\n    if startswith(word, vowels)\n        return \"$(word)way\"\n    else\n        return \"$(split(word, \"\")[2:end])ay $first\"\n    end\nend\n```\nThis script defines a function `pig_latinify` that takes in an array of strings. It then starts a new process on each string using the `@spawnat 2 pig_latin(string)` expression (which means spawn the process on worker 2), and then waits for all processes to finish with the `@sync begin ... end` construct.\n\nPlease replace `2` with whatever is the id of your secondary worker in your Julia configuration. You can check this by running `Distributed.workers()`.\n\nThis script also defines a helper function `pig_latin` that takes a single word and converts it to pig latin according to the rules defined above.","status":200,"tokens":[99,367],"elapsed":4.151127585,"_type":"aimessage"}]
