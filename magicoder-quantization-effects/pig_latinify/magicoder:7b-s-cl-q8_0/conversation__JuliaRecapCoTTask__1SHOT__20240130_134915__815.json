[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To implement the function `pig_latinify`, we first need to define what \"Pig Latin\" is: In this language, every word begins with its first consonant cluster, followed by \"ay\". If a word starts with a vowel sound, \"way\" is added at the end. So if you have the sentence \"apple\", it becomes \"applaYay\".\n\nHere's an example of how to implement this function in Julia using threads:\n```julia\nimport Base.@threaded\nimport Dicts\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    @threaded for string in strings\n        println(pig_latin_word(string))\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_word(word::AbstractString)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    rest = word[2:end]\n\n    if first_letter in vowels\n        return \"$restway\"\n    else \n        return \"$(rest)$first_letteray\"\n    end\nend\n```\nPlease replace \"{{instructions}}\" with your special instructions. They can be anything related to the problem, for example, additional rules or performance considerations. The `pig_latinify` function is now threaded and will print each transformed word on a separate line.","status":200,"tokens":[0,317],"elapsed":3.611941936,"_type":"aimessage"}]
