[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

This function works by iterating over each word and moving the first vowel it encounters to the end. If no vowels are found, it simply returns the original word as it is.\n\nThis solution uses Julia's built-in multithreading capabilities (via `pmap`) which allows for efficient parallel processing of the strings in the input array.","status":200,"tokens":[0,297],"elapsed":3.369581907,"_type":"aimessage"}]
