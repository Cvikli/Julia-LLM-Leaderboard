It extracts the first letter of the word (`word[1]`) and then adds it to the end of the rest of the word (`word[2:end]`). It also adds \"ay\" at the end.\n\nYou can call `pig_latinify` on your example array like this:\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]\npig_latinify(words)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,315],"elapsed":3.551613691,"_type":"aimessage"}]
