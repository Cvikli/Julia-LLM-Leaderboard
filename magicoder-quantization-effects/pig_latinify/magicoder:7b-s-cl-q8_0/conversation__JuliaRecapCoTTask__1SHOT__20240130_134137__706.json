[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Then, each thread takes one word out of this queue, checks if it starts with a vowel or not, applies the appropriate transformation (keeping in mind that Pig Latin treats \"qu\" as an exception), and puts the result into another Channel `results`. \n\nFinally, we collect all results from the `results` channel and return them as a vector. \n\nThe above function doesn't use any external packages and is fairly straightforward to understand. Note that in Pig Latin, \"qu\" prefixes are not moved to the end of words (as they don't count as consonants). \n\nThe `Threads.@threads for _ in 1:Threads.nthreads()` construct starts a number of threads equal to the number of CPU cores available on your machine. For each thread, it repeatedly takes words from the queue and processes them until there are no more words left.","status":200,"tokens":[0,565],"elapsed":6.536235503,"_type":"aimessage"}]
