The main logic is in the `pig_latin` function, which transforms one string into its pig latin equivalent. It uses multithreading to parallelize the transformation of each word. The channel `chan` holds the transformed words until they can be retrieved by the caller.","status":200,"tokens":[0,352],"elapsed":3.997957613,"_type":"aimessage"}]
