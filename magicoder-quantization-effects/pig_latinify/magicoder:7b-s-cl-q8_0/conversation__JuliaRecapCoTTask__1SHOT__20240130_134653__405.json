[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is the code you asked for:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\naddprocs() # Start an additional process\n@everywhere using SharedArrays\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::SharedArray)\n    @sync begin\n        for i in workers()\n            @spawnat i pig_latinify!(strings, i)\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify!(strings, workerid)\n    @showprogress \"Translating...\" for (i,str) in enumerate(strings[workerid])\n        strings[workerid][i] = string(str[1], \"_\", str[2:end], \"ay\")\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function creates a new process using `addprocs()`, which allows us to use the `@spawnat` macro for distributing the computation across different threads. The `pig_latinify!` is run in each thread, and it applies the pig latin transformation on the strings owned by that particular worker.\n\nRemember to replace `\"Translating...\"` with whatever string you want to see as a progress bar during computation. This is just a placeholder for now.\n\nAlso, ensure you have installed the `SharedArrays` package and imported it in your code. If not, you can install it using the following command: \n```julia\nPkg.add(\"SharedArrays\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,318],"elapsed":3.648810954,"_type":"aimessage"}]
