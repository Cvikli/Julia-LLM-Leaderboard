Each task is defined with a separate thread. \n\nNote that this implementation only prints the pig latin version of the strings and it does not return anything as \"pig latin\" isn't stored in the same place as the original string, so there isn't any useful data to return. \n\nAlso note that for real use cases, you might want a function that stores the result or handles errors differently (e.g., by using `Future` objects).","status":200,"tokens":[0,197],"elapsed":2.245686276,"_type":"aimessage"}]
