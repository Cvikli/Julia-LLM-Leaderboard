Each word from our input vector is put into this channel.\n- We then start up as many worker threads as there are cores on our machine, and each of them pulls a word off the channel and translates it to Pig Latin. The results are appended to an array that we return at the end.\n\nThis implementation uses Julia's multi-threading capabilities, making maximum use of your CPU resources.","status":200,"tokens":[0,407],"elapsed":4.54497086,"_type":"aimessage"}]
