[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `@sync begin ... end` block ensures that all asynchronous operations (the transformation of each word to pig latin) are performed concurrently, which can significantly improve performance for large inputs. \n\nThe `pig_latinify_word` function handles the conversion of a single word to pig latin. It checks if the first letter is a vowel and adjusts the translation accordingly. If not, it moves the first letter to the end of the word and appends \"ay\". The `@async println(pig_latinify_word(word))` line in the `pig_latinify` function runs each word transformation on a separate thread.\n\nPlease note that this solution is using the Transformers.jl package, which has been used for demonstration purposes but not strictly necessary to solve the problem.","status":200,"tokens":[0,456],"elapsed":3.568402862,"_type":"aimessage"}]
