[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It then defines a nested helper function `convert_word` that changes a single word to pig latin and stores it in `result`. This helper function checks if the first letter is uppercase or not, and then applies Pig Latin transformation accordingly.\n\nFinally, the main `pig_latinify` function iterates over each index using `@threads`, creating a new thread for each conversion operation. The threads are joined after all conversions have been performed.\n\nTo use this function:\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"banana\"]\npig_latinified = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln.(pig_latinified)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[403,346],"elapsed":10.384361814,"_type":"aimessage"}]
