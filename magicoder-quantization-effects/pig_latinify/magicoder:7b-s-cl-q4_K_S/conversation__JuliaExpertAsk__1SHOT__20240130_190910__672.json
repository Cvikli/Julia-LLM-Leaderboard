Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might accomplish this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\n# Pig Latin Translator Function \nfunction pig_latinify(s::AbstractString)\n    words = split(s, \" \")\n    piglatin_words = map(words) do word\n        first_letter = word[1]\n        rest_of_word = word[2:end]\n        \n        if islowercase(first_letter) \n            return string(\"ay\", rest_of_word, first_letter)\n        elseif isuppercase(first_letter) \n            return uppercase(string(\"AY\", rest_of_word, lowercase(first_letter)))\n        end\n    end\n    \n    piglatin = join(piglatin_words, \" \")\n    return piglatin\nend\n\n# Main Function \nfunction main()\n    # Vector of Strings \n    strings = [\"hello\", \"world\"]\n    workers = addprocs(2) # add two new processes to pool\n    \n    @sync begin\n        for worker in workers\n            @spawn on(worker) do \n                result_strings = pig_latinify.(strings) \n                println(\"Pig Latin Translation: \", result_strings)\n            end\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nmain()\n```\n\nThis program works by breaking down the work into chunks and assigning each chunk to a separate worker process. The `pig_latinify` function is applied to each string in parallel using `@spawn on(worker) do ... end`. \n\nPlease note that this is just an example, and might not cover all edge cases of Pig Latin grammar.","status":200,"tokens":[0,395],"elapsed":3.094502519,"_type":"aimessage"}]
