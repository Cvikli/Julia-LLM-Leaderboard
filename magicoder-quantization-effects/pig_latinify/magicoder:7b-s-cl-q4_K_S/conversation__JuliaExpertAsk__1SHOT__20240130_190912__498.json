It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example solution written in Julia using multithreading:\n\n```julia\nimport Base.Threads: @spawn\nusing Distributed\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    # Start a new process for each string, to take advantage of multithreading\n    threads = @spawn [pig_latinify_one(s) for s in strings]\n    return fetch(threads)\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_one(str::String)\n    words = split(str, \" \") # Split into individual words\n    result = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        first_letter = word[1]\n        rest = word[2:end]\n\n        # Move the first letter to the end and append it with \"ay\"\n        piglatin_word = string(rest * first_letter * \"ay\") \n        result = result == \"\" ? piglatin_word : \" $piglatin_word\"\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n```\nThe `pig_latinify` function is responsible for creating a new process (thread) for each string in the input array. It then waits for all these threads to finish and returns their results. \n\nThe `pig_latinify_one` function operates on a single string, converting it to pig latin by moving the first letter to the end and appending \"ay\". Note that this is a very simple implementation of pig Latin transformation and doesn't handle all possible edge cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,348],"elapsed":2.692852234,"_type":"aimessage"}]
