It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's an example of how you could do this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(input::Array{String})\n    results = Array{String}(undef, length(input)) # pre-allocate results array \n    threads = Threads.nthreads() \n    chunksize = div(length(input), threads) + 1\n    \n    @sync begin\n        for i in 1:threads\n            t = @spawn Threads.threadid() == i ? pig_latinify_chunk(input, results, i, chunksize) : nothing\n            push!(results, t)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return results\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_chunk(input::Array{String}, results::Array{String}, threadid::Int64, chunksize::Int64)\n    for j in ((threadid-1)*chunksize + 1):min((threadid*chunksize), length(input))\n        word = input[j]\n        vowel_index = findfirst(isequal('a'), reverse(word))\n        \n        if vowel_index != nothing # check for consonant at the beginning of a word\n            results[j] = word[vowel_index+1:end]*\"ay\"*word[1:vowel_index-1]\n        else \n            results[j] = word*\"ay\"\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\nThis script creates two functions `pig_latinify` and `pig_latinify_chunk`. The first one distributes the work over different threads, the second is a chunk of work for each thread to complete. \n\nIt's important to note that this solution assumes that all words in input array are separated by spaces which might not always be true, and also it does not handle capital letters or punctuation.\n\nPlease, modify as per your needs.","status":200,"tokens":[0,449],"elapsed":3.527204329,"_type":"aimessage"}]
