It uses `@threads` macro to spawn separate threads for each word in the input vector. Each thread calls the `pig_latin` function and pushes the result into the resulting array `result`.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function takes a string as an argument, checks whether the first letter is vowel or not, and then changes it to pig latin according to the rules.  If the first letter of the word is a vowel, it adds \"ay\" at the end; otherwise, it moves all letters in the string starting from the second one and adds them before the first letter, followed by \"ay\".","status":200,"tokens":[103,330],"elapsed":28.730915567,"_type":"aimessage"}]
