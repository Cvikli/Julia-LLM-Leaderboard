[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Here's an example:\n\n```julia\nusing DistributedArrays\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strs::Vector{String})\n    da = distribute(strs) # Distribute array on workers\n    \n    result = @distributed for str in da\n        words = split(str, \" \") \n        [pig_latin_word(w) for w in words] |> join(\" \")\n    end\n\n    return fetch(result) # Gather result from distributed computation\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_word(word::String)\n    if islower(first(word)) \n        word * \"ay\"\n    else\n        capitalize(word[2:end] * \"-\" * word[1]) * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn the above code, we have a function called `pig_latinify` which operates on an array of strings. The `@distributed` macro is used to divide the computation into parts and distribute these parts among different workers (processes) in parallel.\n\nYou can use it like this:\n```julia\nstrs = [\"hello\", \"world\"]\npig_latinify(strs)\n```\n\nNote that this code assumes you have Julia installed with the `DistributedArrays` package available. If not, you can install it via the Pkg REPL mode:\n```julia\n]add DistributedArrays\n```\nThen you can run your Julia script with multiple processes using `julia -p 4 myscript.jl` (replace 4 with number of workers) to take advantage of parallelism.","status":200,"tokens":[0,422],"elapsed":3.32407852,"_type":"aimessage"}]
