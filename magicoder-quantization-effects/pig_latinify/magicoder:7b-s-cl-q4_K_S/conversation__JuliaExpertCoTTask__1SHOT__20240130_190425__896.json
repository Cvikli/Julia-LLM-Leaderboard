It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia using multi-threading:\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words) \n    function translate(word)\n        first_letter = word[1]\n        rest = word[2:end] * \"ay\"\n        return \"$rest $first_letter\"\n    end\n    \n    threads = @async [translate(word) for word in words]\n    wait(threads)  # Wait until all threads finish\n    \n    return collect(threads)\nend\n```\nHere, the `pig_latinify` function creates a new function called `translate` that translates each word into pig latin. It then uses `@async` to create an array of threads, each running the `translate` function on one of the words in the input list. The `wait` function is used to pause execution until all threads finish. Finally, we collect the results from the threads into a single array and return it.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the input strings are just regular English words (i.e., they don't contain any special characters or punctuation). If your task allows for more complex inputs, you would need to modify this code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,273],"elapsed":2.138464661,"_type":"aimessage"}]
