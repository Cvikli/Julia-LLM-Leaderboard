It first checks if the first letter of the word is a vowel (one of 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o' or 'u'). If it is, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word. Otherwise, it moves all letters after the first one to the end of the word and adds \"ay\". The function returns the transformed array.","status":200,"tokens":[0,306],"elapsed":2.400860174,"_type":"aimessage"}]
