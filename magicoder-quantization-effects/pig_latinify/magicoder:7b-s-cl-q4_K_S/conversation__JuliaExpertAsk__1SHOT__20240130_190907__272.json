The helper function `convert_word` checks if the first letter of the word is a vowel or not, then transforms it accordingly. \n\nThe `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` is used here because this task can be done in parallel for all words, thus improving performance. \n\nPlease note that Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) might limit the true benefits of multithreading with threads in Python due to its single-threaded nature, but it should still run faster than a single thread solution as it utilizes multiple cores.","status":200,"tokens":[0,285],"elapsed":2.221762486,"_type":"aimessage"}]
