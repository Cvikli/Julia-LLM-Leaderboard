It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the python code for the problem statement using concurrent.futures module:\n\n```python\nimport concurrent.futures \n\ndef pig_latinify(word):\n    return word[1:] + word[0] + 'ay' if word[0] in 'aeiou' else word + 'ay'\n\ndef translate_phrase(words):\n    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:\n        futures = {executor.submit(pig_latinify, word) for word in words}\n    \n    return [future.result() for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures)]\n```\n\nYou can use it like this:\n\n```python\nprint(translate_phrase(['hello', 'world']))\n```\n\nThis code creates a pig latin translator function called `pig_latinify`. If the first letter of the input word is a vowel, the word is moved to the end and 'ay' is appended. Otherwise, the word is added at the end with 'ay'. The function `translate_phrase` takes in an array of words and translates each word into pig latin using separate threads. \n\nNote: This code works for English words. Non-English words may not be correctly translated.","status":200,"tokens":[0,296],"elapsed":2.280587451,"_type":"aimessage"}]
