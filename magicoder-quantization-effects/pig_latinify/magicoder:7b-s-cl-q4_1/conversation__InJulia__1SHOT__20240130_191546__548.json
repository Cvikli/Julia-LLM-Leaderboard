It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::AbstractVector{String})\n    Threads.@threads for word in words\n        # Split the string into characters and reverse it \n        reversed_word = collect(reverse(word))\n        \n        # Get the first consonant (if any) and push the rest to the end of the array \n        consonants = [c for c in 'a':'z' if islowercase(c)]\n        i = 0\n        for char in reversed_word\n            if !in(char, consonants)\n                break\n            end\n            push!(reversed_word, pop!(reversed_word))\n        end\n        \n        # Combine the characters back into a string and add 'way' to the end \n        word = join(reverse(reversed_word)) * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function is designed for English language text. It does not account for spaces between words or special cases like capitalized first letters, non-English characters, and so on. \n\nNote that this code may cause race conditions due to shared mutable state (the `word` variable). For a completely threadsafe version, you would need to create a unique mutable object for each word in the array and pass that into the function instead of just sharing one variable across threads. Also, it does not perform any error checking or validation on its inputs. You might want to add those checks depending on your specific use case.","status":200,"tokens":[0,340],"elapsed":2.707681066,"_type":"aimessage"}]
