If it's a vowel, it puts it at the end and appends \"ay\" otherwise it takes the first two letters from the word and put them at the end and append \"ay\". The `@threads for` loop applies this transformation on each string in the vector `words`.\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output: \n\n```bash\n[\"elloHay\", \"applepay\", \"strongray\", \"orldway\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,281],"elapsed":2.253540565,"_type":"aimessage"}]
