The function `pig_latinify()` uses the `@spawnat :anywhere` macro from Distributed package to spawn tasks that execute in parallel on different threads. In this case, it is running a task for each word in the list.\n\nThe `process_word(word::String)` function implements the Pig Latin transformation rule: words start with their initial consonant or vowel letter followed by \"ay\". The first letter of the word becomes uppercase to maintain consistency with standard English spelling rules for loanwords (e.g., \"apple\" -> \"appleyay\").\n\nThe `@spawnat :anywhere` macro spawns a new task on the same process where it's called. This is useful when you want to ensure tasks run in separate threads, especially when using Distributed computing tools. \n\nNote: To use this function, you need to add `using Distributed`. It will not work if distributed computing package is not installed and loaded.","status":200,"tokens":[0,395],"elapsed":3.192214708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
