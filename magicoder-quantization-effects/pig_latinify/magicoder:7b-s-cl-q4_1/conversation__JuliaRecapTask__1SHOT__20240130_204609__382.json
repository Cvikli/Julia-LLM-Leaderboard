[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

This will use the `pmap` function from Distributed.jl to apply the transformation to each word on a different thread:\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    @sync for word in words\n        @async push!(result, pig_latinify(word))\n    end\nend\n\n# result now contains the transformed words.\n```\nRemember to replace `result` with the actual collection that you are using to store the results. \n\nThis code assumes that you're running Julia on a multi-core machine, and each word in `words` is a string. It also assumes that you've previously activated parallel computation with `@everywhere using Distributed`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,403],"elapsed":3.36721536,"_type":"aimessage"}]
