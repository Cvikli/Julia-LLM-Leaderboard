[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses shared memory for parallelization, and it relies on Julia's built-in multi-threading capabilities.\n\nPlease note that this code has to be run inside a REPL which supports multiple threads, or else you might get errors as not all systems support multiple threads. For running the code in parallel, one can use a library such as DistributedArrays or SharedArrays (from Transducers.jl) for handling shared memory.\n  \nAlso note that the output from this program may be slightly different than what's expected because it depends on your systemâ€™s ability to spawn multiple threads and run them simultaneously.","status":200,"tokens":[0,540],"elapsed":4.385063575,"_type":"aimessage"}]
