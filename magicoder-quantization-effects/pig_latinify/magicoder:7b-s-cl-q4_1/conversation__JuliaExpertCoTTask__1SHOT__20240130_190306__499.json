Here is how your function might look:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strs)\n    # Define the function to be applied on each string\n    function translate(s::String)\n        words = split(s, \" \")\n        for i in 1:length(words)\n            word = words[i]\n            if islowercase(word[1])\n                words[i] = lowercase(word * \"ay\")\n            else\n                words[i] = uppercase(word * \"ay\")\n            end\n        end\n        return join(words, \" \")\n    end\n    \n    # Translate each string in the vector using a separate thread for each one\n    return [Threads.@spawn translate(str) for str in strs]\nend\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\n```\n\nPlease note that Threads in Julia are not real parallel computing threads. They are lightweight tasks that can run independently on the same CPU core, but they do not actually run in parallel. The @spawn macro is used to create a new task for each word being translated and return their results asynchronously.\n\nAlso note that this will only speed up the process if there are enough strings to translate to warrant additional threads. On smaller vectors of strings, it might even be slower due to the overhead of creating and managing multiple threads.","status":200,"tokens":[0,336],"elapsed":2.714560974,"_type":"aimessage"}]
