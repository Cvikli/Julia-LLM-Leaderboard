It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of the `pig_latinify` function:\n\n```julia\nimport Base.Threads: @spawn\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::AbstractVector{String}) \n    pig_latin_words = similar(words)\n    \n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        word = words[i]\n        \n        if occursin(r\"^[aeiou]\", lowercase(word))\n            pig_latin_words[i] = \"ay_\" * word\n        else\n            pig_latin_words[i] = lowercase(replace(word, r\"^(.*?)([bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz])(.*)$\", s -> \"$2$1ay\")) \n        end\n    end\n    \n    return pig_latin_words\nend\n```\nThis function takes a vector of strings as input and returns the same vector transformed into Pig Latin. The `if else` condition checks if the word starts with a vowel, in which case \"ay_\" is added to the start; otherwise, it uses a regular expression to find the first consonant cluster (letters that come before any vowels), and adds that to the end of the word plus \"ay\". This process is performed on each string separately.\n\nPlease note that `Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)` creates a loop over indices of `words` array, where each index will be processed by different thread.\n\nAlso keep in mind that you may need to add error handling and edge-cases based on your needs.","status":200,"tokens":[0,365],"elapsed":2.937781622,"_type":"aimessage"}]
