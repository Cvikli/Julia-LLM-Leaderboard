[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

You can create an async function which will be executed in parallel using different threads. This is achieved by using the `@async` macro, and `fetch` function to get the result of each thread. Also, don't forget that you need to have a good understanding about how asynchronous programming works in Julia, especially dealing with shared state, deadlocks etc.\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    @sync for string in strings\n        @async begin\n            result = @distributed [] for word in split(string) \n                pig_latin(word)\n            end\n            println(result)\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word::String)\n    if islowercase(first(word))\n        return string(word, \"ay\")\n    else\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function `pig_latinify` takes a vector of strings as input and transforms each string into pig latin. Each string is processed in parallel using different threads thanks to `@sync for`. Inside this loop, another loop is added which splits the string into words and applies the `pig_latin` function to it. The result of these transformations are printed out sequentially because of the `println` statement inside the `@async begin ... end` block. \n\nPlease remember that you need to install Distributed package using Pkg.add(\"Distributed\") if not installed yet and make sure you have Julia with multi-threading enabled by calling `JULIA_NUM_THREADS=n julia`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,373],"elapsed":3.010862829,"_type":"aimessage"}]
