We use `@Threads`, which is Julia's parallel computing macro for multi-threading, to iterate over each string in separate threads. The helper function `_pig_latinify` does the actual transformation per word, while `isletter` checks if a character is an English letter (ignoring 'y'). The function assumes that words are not capitalized and do not end with punctuation.\n\nThis implementation translates each English word to pig Latin by moving the first consonant or vowel to the end of the word followed by \"ay\". If a non-vowel, non-consonant character is found before a vowel, it moves that character to the end and replaces it with \"ay\". The function also ignores 'y' which may be seen as both a consonant or a vowel depending on your dialect of English.\n\nSo if you run `pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])`, the output will be `['ellohp', 'appley', 'rongsway', 'orldway']`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,518],"elapsed":4.205559265,"_type":"aimessage"}]
