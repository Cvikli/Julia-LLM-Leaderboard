Let's start by defining our `pig_latinify` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    # define our translator function\n    translate_word(word) = isempty(word) ? \"\" : string(word[end], word[1:(end-1)], \"ay\")\n\n    # use map to apply the translation to each word in the vector\n    return map(translate_word, words)\nend\n```\n\nNow we can use `DistributedArrays.splitdistribute` and `DistributedArrays.collect` functions to distribute our work across multiple threads:\n\n```julia\nusing DistributedArrays\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::AbstractVector{String})\n    # split the vector into chunks for each worker\n    chunked = splitdistribute(words)\n\n    # apply the translation to each word in a separate thread\n    translated_chunks = [pmap(translate_word, chunk) for chunk in chunked]\n    \n    # collect the results and return them as a single vector\n    return collect(translated_chunks)\nend\n```\n\nPlease note that this will only work if you have multiple threads or workers available. You can increase the number of workers using `addprocs()`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,321],"elapsed":2.562767099,"_type":"aimessage"}]
