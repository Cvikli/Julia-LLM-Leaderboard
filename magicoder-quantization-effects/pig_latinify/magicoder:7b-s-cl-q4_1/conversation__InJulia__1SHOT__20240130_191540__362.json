Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the code that meets your requirement in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads, Distributed\n\n@everywhere function pig_latinify(str::AbstractString)\n    words = split(lowercase(str), ' ')\n    pig_latin = join([pig_latin_word(w) for w in words], \" \")\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{T}) where T <: AbstractString\n    Threads.@threads foreach(string -> @show pig_latinify(string), strings)\nend\n\n@everywhere function pig_latin_word(w::AbstractString)\n    return endswith(w, 'e') ? string(w[2:end], w[1]) * \"way\" : string(w[2:end] * \"-\" * w[1] * \"ay\")\nend\n```\nYou can call the `pig_latinify` function with a vector of strings as follows:\n```julia\nstrings = [\"apple\", \"orange\", \"banana\"]\nprintln(pig_latinify(strings))\n```\nThis program first defines three functions.\nThe `pig_latinify` function takes in a Vector{String} and uses `@threads foreach` to iterate over each string on separate threads, calling the inner `pig_latinify` function for that string. The `@everywhere` macro is used here so that these functions are defined globally so they can be picked up by other workers when using Distributed.\nThe `pig_latin_word` function takes in a String and converts it to pig latin by moving the first letter of each word to the end of the word with \"ay\" appended, and if the word ends in an \"e\", just append \"way\".\nPlease note that the `@show` macro is used in order to display the result of each translation for each thread.","status":200,"tokens":[0,430],"elapsed":3.448483475,"_type":"aimessage"}]
