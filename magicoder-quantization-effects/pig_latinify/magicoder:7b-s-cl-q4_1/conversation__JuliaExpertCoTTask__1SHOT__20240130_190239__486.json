This function takes an argument `word`, and checks if the first letter is a vowel (or uppercase vowel). If it's not, then we take the substring of `word` from second character onwards, and append the first character to end. We make sure that we convert the first character to lowercase before appending it to avoid any inconsistencies with case.\n\nIf the first letter is a vowel (or uppercase), we simply return the word as it is. \n\nThe `pig_latinify` function returns the transformed string. We then apply this function to every element of our vector using `@distributed for`. This starts a new thread for each word in the array, allowing us to perform operations on them concurrently. \n\nPlease note that pig Latin is typically pronounced with an English accent, and usually only applied to words that start with a vowel or consonant sound. Therefore, this implementation assumes English language contexts. If you need to implement for another language, please provide more specific rules.","status":200,"tokens":[230,516],"elapsed":13.40580291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
