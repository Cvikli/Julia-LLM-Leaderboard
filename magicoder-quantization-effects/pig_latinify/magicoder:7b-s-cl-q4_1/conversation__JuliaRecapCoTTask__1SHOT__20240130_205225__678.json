[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

If there are no special instructions, you can leave this part empty.\n  \nThe function `isuppercase(word[1])` checks if the first character is uppercase and `!islowercase(word[2])` verifies that it is not lowercase to check for capitalized first letter. \n\nIf a word starts with a vowel, \"ay\" is appended at the end of the word. For any other characters, we leave them untouched. The `|>` operator here is a shorthand for `reduce(..., Transducers.Identity(), ...)` where you replace `...` with your transducer operation.\n  \nIn the function body, `@threads` starts threads, and inside the loop, it applies the rules to each word in parallel. The `|> collect` at the end gathers all results into a Vector. \n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\"]\npig_latinify(words) # returns [\"elloHay\", \"orldway\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[406,408],"elapsed":19.553187403,"_type":"aimessage"}]
