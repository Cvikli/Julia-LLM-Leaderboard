[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem, we will need a few things:\n1) A way of transforming English words into pig Latin.\n2) A way to handle the multi-threaded operations. \n3) We may also want to take special instructions into account.\n\nIn Julia, we can achieve multi-threading by using the Threads library and making use of the `@spawn` macro provided by it. For example:\n```julia\nThreads.@spawn while condition continue end\n```\n\nAs for converting English words to pig Latin, you could consider breaking down each string into individual words, then applying a function to each word. This function would take an English word as input and return the transformed piglatin word. \n\nHere is the implementation:\n```julia\nusing Threads\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String}, instructions...)\n    # Break down string into words\n    words = map(split, strings)\n    \n    # Apply function to each word in parallel\n    new_words = [Threads.@spawn convertWordToPigLatin(word[1]) for word in words]\nend\n\nfunction convertWordToPigLatin(word::String)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']  # English vowels\n\n    if startswith(word, vowels)\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        return replace(word, r\"^([bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz]+)\", s\"\\1ay\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\nPlease note: this is a basic implementation and doesn't handle all the specifics of the piglatin language. It also assumes that words are always separated by spaces, and does not handle punctuation or multiple spaces between words. You would need to add extra logic for these cases if they apply to your instructions.","status":200,"tokens":[0,427],"elapsed":3.45384074,"_type":"aimessage"}]
