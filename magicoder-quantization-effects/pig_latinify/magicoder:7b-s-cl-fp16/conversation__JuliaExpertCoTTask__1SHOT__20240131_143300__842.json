[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

This translation simply moves the first letter of the word to the end of the word followed by \"ay\".\n\nThe `@threads` macro is used to create a new thread for each iteration. This allows us to run the iterations concurrently, which can speed up our program if we're working with many words.","status":200,"tokens":[0,307],"elapsed":5.328399693,"_type":"aimessage"}]
