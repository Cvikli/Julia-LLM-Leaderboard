We then use `@sync begin ... end` to ensure all threads are joined before the main function returns. The `@async println(pig_latinify(word))` expression creates a new thread for each word in `words`, where `println` is called with the result of `pig_latinify`.\n\nWhen you run this code, it will print out:\n```julia\nellohay\nappleyay\nstrongway\norldway\n```","status":200,"tokens":[230,255],"elapsed":53.575430731,"_type":"aimessage"}]
