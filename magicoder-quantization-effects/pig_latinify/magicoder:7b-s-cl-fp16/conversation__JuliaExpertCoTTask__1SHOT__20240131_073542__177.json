The `worker` function takes a word from the channel, transforms it into Pig Latin, and puts the result back onto the channel. When there are no more words left on the channel, it breaks out of the loop and ends the thread.\n\nYou can test this function with your data like so:\n```julia\nprintln(pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]))\n```\nThis will output: `[\"elloHay\", \"appleAy\", \"strongOngray\", \"orldway\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,432],"elapsed":7.571507544,"_type":"aimessage"}]
