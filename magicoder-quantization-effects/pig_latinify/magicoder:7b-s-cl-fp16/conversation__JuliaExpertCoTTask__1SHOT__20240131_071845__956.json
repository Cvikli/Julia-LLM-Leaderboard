[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the code in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    # Create an empty vector to store the transformed words\n    transformed_words = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each word in the input array\n    for word in words\n        # Split the word into a list of characters\n        chars = collect(word)\n        \n        # If the word starts with a vowel, add \"way\" to the end and append it to the transformed_words vector\n        if first(chars) âˆˆ ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n            push!(transformed_words, string(word * \"way\"))\n            \n        # If the word starts with a consonant, move the first letter to the end and add \"ay\" at the end\n        else\n            push!(transformed_words, string(chars[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\"))\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Return the transformed words vector\n    return transformed_words\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each word in the input array. For each word, it checks whether the first letter is a vowel or not and transforms the word accordingly. The transformation is done using string manipulation operations in Julia. \n\nTo run this function on multiple threads, you can use `Threads.@threads` macro:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    transformed_words = Threads.@spawn pig_latinify(words)\nend\n```\n\nThe `@spawn` function creates a new task that will run in the background. The `Threads.@threads` macro then waits for all spawned tasks to complete before returning control back to the caller.","status":200,"tokens":[0,404],"elapsed":7.337638836,"_type":"aimessage"}]
