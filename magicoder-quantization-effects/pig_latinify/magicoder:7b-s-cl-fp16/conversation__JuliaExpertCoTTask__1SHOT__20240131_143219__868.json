[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `@everywhere` macro is used to make this function available on all worker processes in the cluster.\n\nThen, `pmap` (a parallel map) is used to apply this function to each element of the input array in a separate thread. The results are collected and returned as an array.","status":200,"tokens":[0,252],"elapsed":4.374274073,"_type":"aimessage"}]
