Note that Pig Latin is a bit more complex than just adding one letter at the end, but here we will add 'ay' to the end of each word:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    # Create an empty array for the results\n    result = fill(\"\", length(strings))\n\n    # Define a function that will run on each thread\n    @threads for i in 1:length(strings)\n        word = split(strings[i]) do word\n            vowel_regex = r\"^([aeiou]|x(?!(ai)|ea)|y(?!au))\"\n            if match(vowel_regex, first(word)) !== nothing || isempty(first(word)) \n                join(word) * \"ay\"\n            elseif length(word) > 1 && match(vowel_regex, last(word)) === nothing\n                word[end] = word[end-1]*word[end]\n                join(word) * \"ay\"\n            else\n                join(word) * \"ay\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Update the results with our transformed words.\n    Threads.@spawn for (i, word) in enumerate(word_threads)\n        result[i] = word\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function will transform each string in a vector of strings into pig latin and return these transformed versions. It does so by creating one thread per string. Each thread takes an index and converts the corresponding string into Pig Latin using a regular expression to check if a word starts with a vowel, and then adds 'ay' to the end. The results are written back into the `result` array in the order of their original indices.\n\nPlease note that this solution may not be optimal for very long vectors or very complex strings, due to overheads associated with creating and managing threads. Also remember that Julia's `Threads.@spawn` is non-blocking, which means it will return immediately, before the task has completed. If you need to wait for the tasks to complete before continuing, consider using Threads.wait().","status":200,"tokens":[0,506],"elapsed":8.861515301,"_type":"aimessage"}]
