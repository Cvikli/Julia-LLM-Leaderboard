[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could implement this in Julia:\n```julia\nusing Distributed, Transducers\n\npig_latinify(words::AbstractVector{String}) = \n    Threads.@threads map(words) do word\n        if isempty(word) || (first(word) == 'a' && length(word) > 1 && lowercase(last(word)) in ('e', 'y'))\n            word * \"ay\"\n        elseif first(word) in uppercase('a'):uppercase('z')\n            word[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\"\n        else\n            word * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n```\nThis function uses the `Distributed.jl` package to run each iteration of the transformation in a separate thread. It checks if the first letter is a vowel (and it's not empty or single-letter and ends with 'e' or 'y'), then adds \"ay\" at the end. If it's not a vowel, it moves all the letters after the first one to the end of the word and appends the first letter followed by \"ay\".\n\nIf you want to use transducers for this task, you can do so as follows:\n```julia\nusing Distributed, Transducers\n\npig_latinify(words::AbstractVector{String}) = \n    Threads.@threads Transducer.foldl((word)->begin\n        if isempty(word) || (first(word) == 'a' && length(word) > 1 && lowercase(last(word)) in ('e', 'y'))\n            word * \"ay\"\n        elseif first(word) in uppercase('a'):uppercase('z')\n            word[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\"\n        else\n            word * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end, Transducer.identity, words)\n```\nThis function uses the `Transducers` package to apply a transducer that applies the transformation to each element in the input iterable (in this case, an array of strings). The `@threads` macro is used to run these transformations in separate threads.","status":200,"tokens":[0,491],"elapsed":8.634720758,"_type":"aimessage"}]
