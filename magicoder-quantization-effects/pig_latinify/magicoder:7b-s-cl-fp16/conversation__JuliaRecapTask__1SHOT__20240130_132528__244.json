[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how this function could be implemented in Julia using multiple dispatch, threads, and parallel computing:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{T}) where T <: AbstractString\n    # Start a pool of threads\n    p = Threads.ThreadPool(length(strings))\n\n    # Define function to be applied in each thread\n    function worker(string)\n        word_list = split(string, ' ')\n        new_words = [piglatin_word(word) for word in word_list]\n        join(new_words, ' ')\n    end\n\n    # Apply the function to each string in parallel\n    piglatin_strings = @showntasks Threads.@spawn map(worker, strings)\nend\n\nfunction piglatin_word(word)\n    if islowercase(word[1])\n        return \"$(word[2:end])ay\"\n    elseif isuppercase(word[1])\n        return uppercase(word)[2:end]*\"ay\"\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function `pig_latinify` takes a Vector of strings and applies the function `worker` to each string, which translates each word in the sentence to pig latin. The `@spawn` macro runs this function on a separate thread for each element of the vector, allowing for parallel processing.\nThe `piglatin_word` function takes one word at a time and checks if it starts with a lowercase or uppercase letter. If it does, it appends 'ay' to the rest of the word. This is the standard way pig latin works by adding 'ay' to the end of words that start with a vowel (in this case, any English alphabetic character).","status":200,"tokens":[0,401],"elapsed":7.109824143,"_type":"aimessage"}]
