It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads, Distributed\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(strings))\n    @sync for (i, s) in enumerate(strings)\n        @spawnat :any results[i] = pig_latin_transform(s)\n    end\n    return results\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_transform(s::String)\n    words = split(s, \" \")\n    pig_latin_words = [pig_latin_word(w) for w in words]\n    return join(pig_latin_words, \" \")\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_word(w::String)\n    if length(w) > 0 && islowercase(first(w))\n        first_letter = w[1]\n        rest = w[2:end] * \"-ay\"\n        return string(rest, first_letter)\n    elseif length(w) > 0 && isuppercase(first(w))\n        first_letter = uppercase(w[1])\n        rest = w[2:end] * \"-AY\"\n        return string(rest, first_letter)\n    else\n        return w * \"-ay\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function spawns a new thread for each word in the input vector. Each thread calls the `pig_latin_transform` function on its word, which transforms that word into pig latin and stores it in the results array. The `@sync` macro ensures that all threads are joined before returning the results.\n\nThe `pig_latin_word` function is a helper function used by `pig_latin_transform`. It checks whether the first letter of the word is uppercase or lowercase and applies the pig latin transformation accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,450],"elapsed":7.856435955,"_type":"aimessage"}]
