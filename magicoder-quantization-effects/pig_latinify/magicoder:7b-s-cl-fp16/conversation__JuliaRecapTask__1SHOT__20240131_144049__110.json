[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the code for the `pig_latinify` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    @sync begin\n        for word in words\n            @async println(pig_latin(word))\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word::AbstractString)\n    if length(word) > 1 && isletter(word[1]) && isletter(word[2])\n        word = reverse(word) * \"ay\"\n    elseif isletter(word[1])\n        word = word * \"ay\"\n    end\n    return word\nend\n```\nIn this code, the `pig_latinify` function uses a `@sync begin ... @async end` block to start multiple threads. Each thread calls the `pig_latin` function on a different element of the input vector. \n\nThe `pig_latin` function checks if the word is more than one letter long and if the first two letters are alphabetic characters. If they are, it reverses the word and appends \"ay\". If only the first character is an alphabetical character, it simply appends \"ay\" to the end of the word. \n\nPlease note that this code assumes that you're printing each translated word as soon as it's finished translating. If you want to collect all translated words into a list and print them at the end, you would need to use a different approach (like using `fetch` on an `@async` call or storing results in a vector).","status":200,"tokens":[0,349],"elapsed":6.113711865,"_type":"aimessage"}]
