[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution for the problem:\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(strings))\n    @sync begin\n        for (i, s) in enumerate(strings)\n            result = @spawnat :any pig_latin_word(s)\n            results[i] = fetch(result)\n        end\n    end\n    return results\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_word(s::String)\n    words = split(s, \" \")\n    pig_latin_words = String[]\n    for word in words\n        if startswith(word, vowel)\n            push!(pig_latin_words, word * \"ay\")\n        else\n            push!(pig_latin_words, word[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\")\n        end\n    end\n    return join(pig_latin_words, \" \")\nend\n\nvowel = [\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"]\n```\nThis solution uses the `@sync` macro to ensure that all threads are joined before returning. The `@spawnat :any` function is used to spawn a new task on any available worker process, and `fetch(result)` is used to get the result of the task once it has finished executing. \n\nThe `pig_latin_word` function splits each string into words, then transforms each word into pig latin. If the word starts with a vowel, it appends \"ay\" at the end; otherwise, it moves the first letter to the end and adds \"ay\". The transformed words are then joined back together into a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,391],"elapsed":6.842846199,"_type":"aimessage"}]
