It creates a channel and pushes each string into the channel, then it uses transducers to apply the pig latin transformation concurrently on each string. The result is collected into an array of transformed strings.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function splits the input string into words, transforms each word using a parallelized version of the `pig_latin_word` function, and then joins the transformed words back together to form the final output string.\n\nThe `pig_latin_word` function implements the pig latin transformation: if a word starts with a vowel (either lowercase or uppercase), it moves that vowel to the end of the word and appends \"ay\". If the word starts with a consonant, it moves all following consonants to the end of the word and appends \"ay\".","status":200,"tokens":[69,614],"elapsed":10.650711849,"_type":"aimessage"}]
