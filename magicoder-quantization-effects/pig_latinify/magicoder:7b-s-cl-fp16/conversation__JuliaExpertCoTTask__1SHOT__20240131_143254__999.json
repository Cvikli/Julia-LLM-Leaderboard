The `pig_latinify_word` helper function takes in a word and checks whether it starts with a vowel. If it does, \"way\" is appended to the end; otherwise, all letters after the first are moved to the end and then the first letter is added at the end of the new string followed by \"ay\".\n\nYou can test this function with your data like so: \n```julia\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\n```\nThis will print out each word transformed to pig latin on separate lines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,339],"elapsed":5.88862764,"_type":"aimessage"}]
