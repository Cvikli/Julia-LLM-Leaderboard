It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can create such function using Julia's multithreading capabilities:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    @sync begin\n        for word in words\n            @async println(pig_latin_word(word))\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_word(word::String)\n    first = word[1]\n    rest = word[2:end] * \"ay\"\n    return \"$rest $first\"\nend\n```\nIn this code, `pig_latinify` is a function that takes in a vector of words and transforms each one into pig latin. It uses the `@sync begin ... end` construct to ensure that all asynchronous tasks (`@async`) are properly synchronized. Each word is transformed using the separate `pig_latin_word` function, which operates on a single word at a time.\n\nPlease note: This code doesn't actually print anything because it uses `@async` and `@sync` to run code in parallel threads but does not send output anywhere. If you want to see the output, just remove the `@async` from `println(pig_latin_word(word))`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,283],"elapsed":4.89823627,"_type":"aimessage"}]
