Inside this function, it uses `@sync begin ... end` to create a new task for each word in the input array and then waits for all tasks to finish using `@async`. \n\nThe `pig_latin` function is used within the `pig_latinify` function to convert each word into pig latin. It takes a word as input, separates it into the first letter (which will be moved to the end of the new word) and the rest of the letters in the word. Then it returns the new word.\n\nWhen you call `pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])`, it will print out each word translated into pig latin on a separate line, because each translation is done in its own task.","status":200,"tokens":[0,293],"elapsed":5.061526428,"_type":"aimessage"}]
