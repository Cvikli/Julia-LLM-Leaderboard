It accepts a vector of words (`words`), and returns an array of Boolean values indicating whether each word in the input array could be correctly transformed into Pig Latin. Note that we're using Julia's `@threads` macro to perform this operation across multiple threads, which allows us to perform these transformations concurrently, thus speeding up the overall process.\n\nWe then call `pig_latinify` with an array of words, and print the output. If a word could be correctly transformed into Pig Latin, its corresponding value in the result is `true`; otherwise, it's `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,453],"elapsed":7.970073382,"_type":"aimessage"}]
