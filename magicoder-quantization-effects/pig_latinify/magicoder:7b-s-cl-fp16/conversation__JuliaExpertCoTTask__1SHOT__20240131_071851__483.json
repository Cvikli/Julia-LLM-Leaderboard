Inside this block, it iterates over each word in the input vector using a for loop. For each word, it creates an asynchronous task (using `@async`) which calls `pig_latin` function on that word and prints the result. \n\nThe `pig_latin` function takes a word as input, extracts its first letter, and then appends this letter to the end of the rest of the word followed by \"ay\". This is how we transform words into pig latin.\n\nFinally, it calls `pig_latinify` with an array of words [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"] as input and prints the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,330],"elapsed":5.784224125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
