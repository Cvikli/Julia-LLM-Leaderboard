Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(strings))\n    @sync for (i, s) in enumerate(strings)\n        result[i] = @spawnat :any pig_latin_transform(s)\n    end\n    return result\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_transform(str::String)\n    words = split(str, ' ')\n    transformed_words = map(pig_latin_word, words)\n    return join(transformed_words, \" \")\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_word(word::String)\n    if length(word) > 1 && islowercase(first(word))\n        word = uppercase(first(word)) * word[2:end] * \"ay\"\n    elseif !isuppercase(first(word))\n        word = first(word) * \"ay\"\n    end\n    return word\nend\n```\nIn this code, `pig_latinify` is the main function that takes a vector of strings and returns a new vector with each string transformed into pig latin. It uses `@sync for ... @spawnat :any` to create a separate thread for each iteration. The `pig_latin_transform` function splits the input string into words, applies `pig_latin_word` to each word, and then joins them back together with spaces in between. Finally, `pig_latin_word` transforms an individual word into pig latin.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that a word is any sequence of characters separated by spaces (i.e., it doesn't handle punctuation or capitalization). You might need to adjust the logic in `pig_latin_word` depending on your specific requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,430],"elapsed":7.426338729,"_type":"aimessage"}]
