It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python implementation for your problem:\n\n```python\nimport concurrent.futures\nimport functools\n\ndef pig_latinify(word):\n    if word[0] in 'aeiou':\n        return f'{word}way'\n    else:\n        return f'{word[1:]}{word[0]}ay'\n\ndef apply_pig_latinify(words):\n    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:\n        results = list(executor.map(pig_latinify, words))\n    return results\n\n# Usage\nwords = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\nprint(apply_pig_latinify(words))\n```\n\nThis program defines a `pig_latinify` function that takes a word and transforms it into pig latin. It checks if the first letter of the word is a vowel, in which case it simply appends 'way' to the end of the word (making sure not to add an extra space). If the first letter is a consonant, it moves that letter to the end of the word and adds 'ay'.\n\nThe `apply_pig_latinify` function uses the concurrent.futures library to create a thread pool executor for applying `pig_latinify` across multiple threads. It maps `pig_latinify` over a list of words using the executor's map method, then collects the results into a list using list().\n\nFinally, it tests this function with a list of strings and prints the result.\n\nPlease note that Python's threading model is not suitable for IO-bound tasks like string transformations because creating new threads has overhead and managing them can be difficult. In case of high volume of data, it might be better to use multiprocessing instead of multithreading.","status":200,"tokens":[0,421],"elapsed":7.373065833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
