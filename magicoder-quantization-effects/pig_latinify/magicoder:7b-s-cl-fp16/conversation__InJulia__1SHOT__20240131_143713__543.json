Then, we add a new process to our Julia session using `@everywhere begin`. This allows us to use the same function definition across multiple processes. We then use `@distributed` to apply this function concurrently to every element of `strings`, and collect the results into a single vector using `vcat`.\n\nNote: The `@everywhere` macro is used here to make sure that the function `pig_latinify` is defined in all workers. It's worth noting that you should be careful with this because it can lead to race conditions if not used correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[69,541],"elapsed":9.39006862,"_type":"aimessage"}]
