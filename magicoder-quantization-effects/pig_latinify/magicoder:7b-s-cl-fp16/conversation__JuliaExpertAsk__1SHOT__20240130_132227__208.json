It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is an example of how you could approach this using the Julia language. \n\nFirstly, we need to import `Threads` package if not already imported.\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n```\n\nThen let's define our pig latin transformer function `pig_latinify`.\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    for word in words\n        println(\"$(word[end])ay $(word[1:(end-1)])us\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\nHere, we are just printing the transformed words. We could modify this to actually return the transformed array of words.\n\nNext, let's create a vector of strings (words) to apply our function on.\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n```\n\nFinally, we use `Threads.@threads` macro to apply our function concurrently on each word in the words array. \n\n```julia\nThreads.@threads for word in words\n    pig_latinify(word)\nend\n```\n\nIn the above code, `@threads` causes the body of the loop to be executed by a new thread for each element in `words`. This allows multiple transformations to occur at once. Each iteration runs on a separate thread.\n\nThis is just an example and it doesn't handle capital letters or punctuation, you would need to add error checking code if you plan on using this in production environment.","status":200,"tokens":[0,336],"elapsed":5.930337111,"_type":"aimessage"}]
