[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin.

The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as input, splits each string into words using the `split` function, applies the `pig_latin` transformation to each word with the `map` function, then concatenates the transformed words back together.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function takes a single word as input and transforms it by moving its first letter to the end of the word and adding \"ay\".\n\nNote that this solution uses Julia's `@async` macro to create asynchronous tasks for each word in the string, and then waits on all these tasks to complete before returning the result. The `wait` function is a blocking operation that waits until all input tasks have completed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,452],"elapsed":7.935661715,"_type":"aimessage"}]
