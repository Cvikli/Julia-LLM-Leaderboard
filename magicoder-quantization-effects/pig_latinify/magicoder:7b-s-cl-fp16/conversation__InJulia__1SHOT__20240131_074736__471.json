The `pig_latin` function is then applied to each string, and the result is printed out.\n\nNote: This code assumes that you're using Julia 1.6 or later because it uses the `@threads` macro for multithreading. If you're on an earlier version of Julia, you can use `Base.Threads.@spawn` instead of `@threads`. Also note that this function does not return anything and just prints out the transformed strings. If you want to collect all transformed strings into a single vector, you would need to modify it slightly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,350],"elapsed":6.037279698,"_type":"aimessage"}]
