It uses `@sync begin ... end` to ensure all threads are joined before the function returns. Inside this block, it runs a loop over each string in the input vector using `@async begin ... end`. This starts up a new thread for each string and then immediately moves on to the next one.\n\nThe `translate_to_pig_latin` function splits the input string into words, translates each word to pig latin, and then joins them back together with spaces in between.\n\nThe `translate_word_to_pig_latin` function takes a single word as its argument, moves the first letter to the end of the word, and adds \"ay\" at the end.\n\nPlease note that this program assumes that words are separated by spaces. If your strings can contain punctuation or other non-word characters, you'll need to modify `translate_to_pig_latin` accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,459],"elapsed":8.001839675,"_type":"aimessage"}]
