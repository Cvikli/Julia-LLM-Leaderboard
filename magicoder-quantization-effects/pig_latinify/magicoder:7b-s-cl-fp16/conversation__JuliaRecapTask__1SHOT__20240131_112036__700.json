[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Inside the function, we use `@sync begin ... end` to ensure all threads are joined at the end. Then, for each word in the input vector, we spawn a new thread using `@async`.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_word` function is then called on each word in its own thread. This function checks if the first letter of the word is a vowel. If it is, it appends \"ay\" to the end of the word and returns the result. If not, it moves all letters after the first one to the end of the word and adds \"ay\" at the beginning.\n\nYou can call this function with a vector of strings as follows:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\npig_latinify(words)\n```\n\nThis will print out the pig latin versions of each word in the console.","status":200,"tokens":[0,382],"elapsed":6.810260155,"_type":"aimessage"}]
