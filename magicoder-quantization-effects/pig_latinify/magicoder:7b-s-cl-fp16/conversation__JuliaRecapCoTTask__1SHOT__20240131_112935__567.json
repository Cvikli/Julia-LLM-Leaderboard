[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `map` function is used with a lambda function to transform each word in the string. If the first letter of the word is lowercase, it's transformed into pig latin where \"ay\" is added at the end and if it starts with a vowel, then that vowel is replaced by its equivalent ending in \"way\". If the first letter is uppercase, it's just converted to uppercase and \"Ay\" is appended. Otherwise, it's transformed into pig latin where \"ay\" is added at the end. The transformed words are then joined back together with spaces between them.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the input strings do not contain punctuation or special characters other than spaces. If such characters are present in the input, they should be handled appropriately before calling `pig_latinify`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,508],"elapsed":8.920744074,"_type":"aimessage"}]
