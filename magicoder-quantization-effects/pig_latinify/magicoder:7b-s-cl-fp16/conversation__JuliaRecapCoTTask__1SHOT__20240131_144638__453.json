[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is an example of how you could write such function:\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    results = Vector{String}()\n    @sync for word in words\n        push!(results, @async begin\n            word_array = split(word, ' ')\n            pig_latin_word = [pig_latin(w) for w in word_array]\n            join(pig_latin_word, \" \")\n        end)\n    end\n    return results\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word::String)\n    if islowercase(first(word)) || (first(word) == 'a' && !isuppercase(second(word)))\n        word = uppercase(word[2:end]) * lowercase(word[1]) * \"ay\"\n    else\n        word = word[2:end] * lowercase(word[1]) * \"ay\"\n    end\n    return word\nend\n```\nHere, `pig_latinify` is a function that takes in a vector of strings and returns a new vector where each string has been transformed into pig latin. The transformation is done by the `pig_latin` function, which appends \"ay\" to the end of the word and moves all consonants from the beginning of the word to the end (unless the first character is a vowel or a consonant followed by an uppercase vowel).\n\nThe `@sync for...end` loop runs each iteration on a separate thread, which should help speed up the process if there are many words in the input vector. The `@async begin...end` construct creates a new task that is scheduled to run on a worker thread as soon as it becomes available.\n\nNote that the function `pig_latin` assumes that words are separated by spaces, and doesn't handle punctuation or capitalization in any special way. If you need these features, you would have to modify the `pig_latin` function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,454],"elapsed":7.971594403,"_type":"aimessage"}]
