[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses a helper function, `pig_latinify`, to apply the transformation on a single string. \n\nThe `pig_latinify` function checks if the word starts with a vowel or not. If it does, it appends \"ayway\" at the end of the word. If it doesn't start with a vowel but contains any vowels in the rest of the word, then it moves all the consonants before the first vowel to the end and append \"ay\". \n\nThe code also includes helper functions for checking if a character is a vowel or not, and if a word contains at least one vowel. These can be useful in determining the rules for Pig Latin translation.","status":200,"tokens":[0,603],"elapsed":10.728422646,"_type":"aimessage"}]
