Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    @sync begin\n        for str in strings\n            @async println(pig_latin(str))\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word)\n    # Your implementation of the Pig Latin transformation here.\nend\n```\n\nThis code uses `@sync` to ensure that all threads are joined before returning from `pig_latinify`. The `@async` macro is used to spawn a new task for each string in the vector, allowing them to be processed concurrently. Each of these tasks calls `pig_latin` on its input word and prints out the result.\n\nRemember to implement the `pig_latin` function according to your own Pig Latin transformation rules. The way it's implemented might depend on whether you treat punctuation as separate words, or if you want to keep them attached to their preceding word.","status":200,"tokens":[0,227],"elapsed":3.929391114,"_type":"aimessage"}]
