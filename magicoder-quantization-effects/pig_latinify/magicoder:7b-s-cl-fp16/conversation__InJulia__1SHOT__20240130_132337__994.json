Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you could implement the function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    result = String[]\n    @threads for string in strings\n        push!(result, pig_latin_transformer(string))\n    end\n    return result\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_transformer(input::String)\n    words = split(lowercase(input), ' ')\n    first_letter = popfirst!(words)\n    rest = join(words, \" \")\n    return \"$rest$first_letteray\"\nend\n```\nThis program will take a vector of strings as input and apply the `pig_latin_transformer` function to each string in a separate thread. The `pig_latin_transformer` function takes an input string, converts it to lowercase and splits it into words. It then removes the first word from the list and joins the remaining words back together. Finally, it appends the original first word (which has been removed) onto the end of the resulting string with \"ay\" added on for the pig latin sound.\n\nPlease note that this is a simple solution and doesn't handle punctuation or capitalization. It also assumes the input strings will always be English words, which aren't capitalized.","status":200,"tokens":[69,301],"elapsed":5.276777019,"_type":"aimessage"}]
