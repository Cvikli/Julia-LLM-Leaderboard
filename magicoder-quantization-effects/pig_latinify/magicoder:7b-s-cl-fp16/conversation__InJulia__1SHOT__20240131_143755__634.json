It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the code for the `pig_latinify` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    @threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        word = words[i]\n        if islowercase(first(word))\n            firstletter = lowercase(first(word))\n            restofword = word[2:end] * \"ay\"\n            results[i] = string(firstletter, restofword)\n        elseif isuppercase(first(word))\n            firstletter = uppercase(first(word))\n            restofword = word[2:end] * \"AY\"\n            results[i] = string(firstletter, restofword)\n        end\n    end\n    return results\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes in a vector of strings `words` and returns a new vector where each string has been transformed to pig latin. If the first letter of the word is lowercase, it changes that letter to lowercase and appends \"ay\". If the first letter of the word is uppercase, it changes that letter to uppercase and appends \"AY\".\n\nThe `@threads` macro allows us to run each iteration over `words` on a separate thread. This function will automatically handle multi-threading for you, making it much faster for large inputs compared to doing it sequentially.","status":200,"tokens":[0,330],"elapsed":5.70333014,"_type":"aimessage"}]
