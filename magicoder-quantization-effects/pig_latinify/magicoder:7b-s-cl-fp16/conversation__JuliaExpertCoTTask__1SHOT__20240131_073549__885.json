It uses channels to pass each word to the `pig_latin_transform` function. The `pig_latin_transform` function is run in separate threads using Julia's `@async` macro. Each thread fetches a word from the channel, transforms it and returns the result.\n\nThe `fetch` function is used to get the result of each thread. This code assumes that the number of threads equals the number of CPU cores on your machine. If you want to use fewer threads, change the argument passed to `@async`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,407],"elapsed":7.067836561,"_type":"aimessage"}]
