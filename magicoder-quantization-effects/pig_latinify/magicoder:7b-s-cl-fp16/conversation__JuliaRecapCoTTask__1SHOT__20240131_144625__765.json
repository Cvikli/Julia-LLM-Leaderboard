[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of the `pig_latinify` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    # Create a channel to store transformed words\n    word_channel = Channel{String}(10)\n    \n    # Start a separate thread for each word\n    @sync begin\n        for word in words\n            @async put!(word_channel, pig_latinify(word))\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Collect transformed words from the channel and return them as a vector\n    result = Vector{String}()\n    for i in 1:length(words)\n        push!(result, take!(word_channel))\n    end\n    return result\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(word::AbstractString)\n    # Split the word into a list of characters\n    chars = collect(word)\n    \n    # If the word starts with a vowel, add 'ay' to it and move all consonants to the end\n    if !isempty(chars) && islower(chars[1]) && ('a':'z' in chars[1] || 'A':'Z' in chars[1])\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    else\n        # Otherwise, move all consonants to the end and add 'ay' at the beginning of the word\n        return join(chars[[findall(!islower, chars)]], \"\") * \"ay\" * lcfirst(word)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we create a channel that will be used to store transformed words. We then start a separate thread for each word in the input vector `words`. Each thread takes a word from the channel and transforms it into pig Latin. After all threads have finished their work, we collect the transformed words from the channel and return them as a vector.\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function itself is also implemented as an asynchronous function that works with channels. It splits each word into characters, checks if the first character is a vowel, and if not, moves all consonants to the end of the word and adds 'ay' at the beginning.\n\nNote: This code assumes that words in the input vector `words` are lowercase English alphabetic strings. It also does not handle punctuation or capital letters, which could be added if necessary.","status":200,"tokens":[0,526],"elapsed":9.248206163,"_type":"aimessage"}]
