[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might approach the problem using Julia, following the guidelines outlined above:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed, Transducers # to demonstrate parallel computing\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    Threads.@threads for word in words\n        first_letter = first(word)\n        rest = word[2:end] * \"_\"  # \"a\" becomes \"_a\", \"apple\" becomes \"apple_\"\n        println(\"$restay\")         # concatenate the rest to the end of the word\n    end\nend\n\n# Testing\npig_latinify([\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"])\n```\n\nIn this example, we use Julia's built-in `Distributed` module to parallelize the pig Latin translation. We take each word from the input array and create a new string that starts with all characters of the word except for its first one (which is moved at the end). Finally, we print out the newly created words.\n\nThis code assumes that the first letter of each word in your list will be a vowel sound (\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", or \"u\"). If there could be consonant sounds as well (like \"p\", \"b\", \"c\", etc.) at the start of words, you would need to adjust the `first_letter` variable accordingly.\n\nAlso note that this code will not preserve capitalization in the input words. If you want to keep case, you'll have to add extra logic to handle that.","status":200,"tokens":[0,343],"elapsed":6.150314669,"_type":"aimessage"}]
