It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Python code for your problem:\n\n```python\nimport concurrent.futures\nimport re\n\ndef pig_latinify(words):\n    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:\n        results = list(executor.map(lambda word: pig_latin_word(word), words))\n    return ' '.join(results)\n\ndef pig_latin_word(word):\n    if re.match('[aeiou]', word, re.I):\n        word += \"way\"\n    else:\n        word = word[1:] + word[0] + \"ay\"\n    return word\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `pig_latinify` that accepts a list of words and applies the `pig_latin_word` function to each one using multiple threads. The `pig_latin_word` function changes a word into pig latin by moving the first letter to the end and appending \"ay\" (unless it's a vowel, then append \"way\").\n\nPlease note that this code requires Python 3.4 or later due to use of concurrent.futures module. Also, remember that Python is not designed for real-time multithreading, so you might face performance issues if your input list is very large.","status":200,"tokens":[0,296],"elapsed":5.12554919,"_type":"aimessage"}]
