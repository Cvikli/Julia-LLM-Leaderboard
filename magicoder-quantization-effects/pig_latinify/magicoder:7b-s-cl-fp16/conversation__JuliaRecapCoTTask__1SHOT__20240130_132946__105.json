X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The rules for the translation are as follows: \n- If the word starts with a vowel, add \"way\" to end. \n- If the word starts with a consonant (not including 'qu'), move all letters after the first one to the end and add \"ay\".\n- For words starting with 'qu', keep only the last letter and move it to the end and add \"ay\".\n\nHere is a possible solution:\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Array{String,1})\n    result = Array{String,1}()\n    @sync for word in words\n        push!(result, @async begin\n            first_letter = word[1]\n            rest_of_word = word[2:end]\n            if lowercase(first_letter) in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']  # vowels\n                return \"$rest_of_word$word\" * \"way\"\n            elseif first_letter == 'q' && length(word)>2  # 'qu'\n                return \"$rest_of_word$word\" * \"ay\"\n            else\n                return \"$rest_of_word$first_letter$word\" * \"ay\"\n            end\n        end)\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `@sync` macro which ensures all asynchronous operations are performed in order. The function `pig_latinify` iterates over each word in the input array and creates a new thread for each one using the `@async begin ... end` construct. The transformed words from these threads are then added to an output array `result`, which is returned by the function at the end. \n\nThis function assumes that the input array of strings will not be empty, and it does not handle capital letters or punctuation, so make sure your inputs meet these requirements when using this function. The `@sync` macro can also lead to performance issues if used improperly (for example, if a thread takes too long), so use it judiciously. \n\nPlease replace \"{{instructions}}\" with the specific instructions you want to add for the task.","status":200,"tokens":[0,509],"elapsed":9.043048408,"_type":"aimessage"}]
