It then creates a nested function `transform_word`, which takes a single word and transforms it into pig latin by moving the first letter to the end and appending 'ay'. \n\nThe outer function uses `@threads` macro from Julia's Threads package to create multiple threads, one for each word in the input array. Each thread calls `transform_word` on its assigned word and prints the result.\n\nWhen you run this code with the given data, it should print:\n```\nelloHay\nappleAy\nstrongOgpay\norldWay\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,290],"elapsed":5.137791305,"_type":"aimessage"}]
