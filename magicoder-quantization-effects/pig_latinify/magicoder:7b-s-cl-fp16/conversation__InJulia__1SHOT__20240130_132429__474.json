It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Firstly, ensure you have the Julia programming language installed in your machine. Below is the code snippet for the `pig_latinify` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    len = length(words)\n    @threads for i=1:len\n        words[i] = pig_latin_transform(words[i])\n    end\n    return words\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_transform(word)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    if length(word) == 0 || word[1] in vowels\n        return word*\"ay\"\n    else\n        return word[2:end]*\"ay\"*word[1]\n    end\nend\n```\nThe `pig_latinify` function launches a separate thread for each string in the input vector. It calls the `pig_latin_transform` function on each string, which translates the word to pig latin. The resulting words are collected into an array and returned. \n\nPlease note that this code won't work properly with multithreading if the strings in your input vector are very long because Julia doesn't support concurrent modification of arrays. If you need to process extremely large inputs, consider using a generator function or other I/O-bound parallelism techniques instead.","status":200,"tokens":[0,314],"elapsed":5.492566142,"_type":"aimessage"}]
