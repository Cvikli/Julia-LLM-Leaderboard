[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can use the `Base.Threads.@threads` macro for multi-threading support. Here's how you can solve this task:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    function transform(word)\n        first_letter = word[1]\n        if islowercase(first_letter) || isdigit(first_letter)\n            return string(word, \"ay\")\n        else\n            return string(word[2:end], first_letter, \"ay\")\n        end\n    end\n    \n    Base.Threads.@threads for word in words\n        println(transform(word))\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a vector of strings as input and applies the pig latin transformation to each string in parallel. The `transform` function checks whether the first letter is lowercase or digit, if so it appends \"ay\" at the end of word otherwise it moves all letters after the first one before the first one and then append \"ay\".\n\nTo use this function:\n```julia\npig_latinify([\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"])\n```\nThis will print each transformed word on a separate line, with each transformation being done in its own thread.","status":200,"tokens":[0,280],"elapsed":4.899098851,"_type":"aimessage"}]
