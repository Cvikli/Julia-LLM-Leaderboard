The function uses Julia's `@async` macro to create new threads for each word translation. Each thread calls the `pig_latin_word` function on its respective word. This function is responsible for translating a single word into Pig Latin.\n\nThe Pig Latin transformation works by moving the first letter of the word to the end and appending \"ay\". All other letters are removed. \n\nWhen you run this script, it will print: [\"elloHay\", \"appleAy\", \"strongOngray\", \"orldway\"].","status":200,"tokens":[0,422],"elapsed":7.343342252,"_type":"aimessage"}]
