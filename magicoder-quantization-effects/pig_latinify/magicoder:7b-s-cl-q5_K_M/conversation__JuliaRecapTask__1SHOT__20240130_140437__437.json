[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin.

The `@sync begin ... end` syntax is used to create a new synchronization context that will block until all spawned tasks have completed. Inside the `begin` block, there's an asynchronous loop (`@async`) for each task that runs in a separate thread.\n\nPlease note: You need Julia 1.6 or newer to use `@sync`.\n\nThe `translate_to_pig_latin` function takes a single string and transforms it into Pig Latin. It does this by taking the first letter of the word, appending it at the end of the rest of the word with \"ay\" appended, and then returning the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,373],"elapsed":3.345805584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
