[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an implementation of the `pig_latinify` function using Julia's multiple dispatch, threads, and standard libraries:\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    result = fill(\"\", length(words)) # initialize results array with empty strings\n    threaded_transform!(result, words) \nend\n\n@threads for i in eachindex(words)\n    word = words[i]\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    \n    if islowercase(first_letter) || isuppercase(first_letter) # check if the first letter of word is a vowel\n        result[i] = word * \"ay\" \n    else\n        result[i] = string(word[2:end], first_letter, \"ay\") # move all letters except the first one to end and add 'ay' at the end\n    end\nend\nreturn result\n```\nThis function works by transforming each word in the input array of strings into pig latin. The transformation process is threaded using `@threads` macro for multicore performance. Each iteration is performed on a separate thread thanks to Julia's built-in support for multithreading.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the first letter of the words is always a letter (not punctuation, numbers, or other special characters). If your input can contain such cases, you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,319],"elapsed":2.856691274,"_type":"aimessage"}]
