It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia code for the `pig_latinify` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    @sync begin\n        for word in words\n            @async begin\n                print(translate_word(word))\n            end\n        end\nend\n\nfunction translate_word(word::AbstractString)\n    # Pig Latin rules: move first consonant cluster to end, then add \"ay\"\n    letters = collect(lowercase(word))\n    if isempty(letters) || (isletter(letters[1]) && !isletter(letters[2]))\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    elseif isletter(letters[1])\n        return word[2:end] * letters[1] * \"ay\"\n    else\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n```\nThis code defines a `pig_latinify` function that iterates over each string (or \"word\") in the input vector. For each word, it spawns a new thread via `@async begin ... end` and then prints out the transformed word using `@sync`. \n\nThe `translate_word` function is called within this process to transform individual words into pig latin. In pig latin, we simply move the first consonant cluster (if any) from the start of a word to the end and add \"ay\". If there are no letters in the word or if the first letter is a vowel but followed by a consonant, we just append \"ay\" at the end.","status":200,"tokens":[0,348],"elapsed":3.049894836,"_type":"aimessage"}]
