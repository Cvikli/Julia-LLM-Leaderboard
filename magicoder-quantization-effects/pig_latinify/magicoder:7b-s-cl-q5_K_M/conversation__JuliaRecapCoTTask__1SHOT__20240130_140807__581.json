[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Special instructions \n- Use Julia's `Threads.@threads` for multithreading. \n- You may use Python's `str.split()`, `str.lower()`, `str.replace()` and `str.join()`.\n- Avoid mutating strings, instead create new ones as needed to avoid race conditions in multi-threading. \n- Keep track of the state with a mutable object (like an array) to ensure accuracy across multiple threads.\n\n# Code\n\nHere is a basic solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String}, instructions::String=\"\")\n    # create an empty vector for storing the results\n    result = Vector{String}()\n    \n    Threads.@threads for word in words\n        push!(result, word[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\")\n    end\n    \n    return join(result, ' ') # convert to a string and join with spaces\nend\n```\n\nThis function will transform each word in the vector `words` into pig latin. It does this by taking the substring from the second character onwards (which contains all of the letters in the word), appending that to the first letter of the word, then appending \"ay\". The transformed words are then joined together with a space delimiter and returned as the result.\n\nThe `@threads` macro will automatically distribute the work across multiple threads if there is more than one CPU core available. If there's only one thread, it will run the same way in Julia 1.x but in Julia 0.6 you might want to use `for word in words`.\n\nThe `push!(result, ...)` line is safe because pushes onto an array in Julia are atomic and so can be safely performed by different threads concurrently without worrying about race conditions. \n\nYou might also modify this function based on specific instructions provided.","status":200,"tokens":[11,415],"elapsed":3.696462015,"_type":"aimessage"}]
