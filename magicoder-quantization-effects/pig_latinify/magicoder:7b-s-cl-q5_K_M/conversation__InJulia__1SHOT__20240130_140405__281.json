It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, we can use the `Threads.@threads for` loop to iterate over a collection in parallel threads. Here's an example of how you might implement this:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads  # import Threads package\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    function pig_latin_word(w)\n        if islowercase(w[1]) || w in [\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"]\n            return string(w, \"ay\")\n        elseif !isascii(w)  # check for non-ASCII character\n            error(\"Non-ASCII characters are not supported.\")\n        else\n            return join([w[2:end], w[1], \"ay\"], \"\")\n        end\n    end\n    \n    Threads.@threads for word in words\n        print(pig_latin_word(lowercase(word)), \" \")  # transform and print each word in a new thread\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function will take as input an array of strings, `words`, and convert each string into pig latin. It makes use of the `Threads.@threads for` loop to parallelize the transformation process across multiple threads.\n\nPlease note that this program does not handle non-ASCII characters. If you have words with non-ASCII characters in your input, you would need to add additional error checking or conversion code to ensure they can be correctly translated into pig latin.","status":200,"tokens":[0,327],"elapsed":2.864174392,"_type":"aimessage"}]
