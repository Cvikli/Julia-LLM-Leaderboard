Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, we can use the Multithreading module for this task. Here is an example:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\nimport Base.Threads: @spawn\n\n# function to convert word to pig latin\nfunction piglatin_word(word)\n    if length(word) > 1 && startswith(word, vowel) # check if the first letter of the word is a vowel\n        return string(word[2:end], word[1], \"ay\") # yes -> move the first letter to end and add 'ay' at the start\n    else\n        return string(word, \"ay\") # no -> just add 'ay' at the end\n    end\nend\n\n# function for converting sentence to pig latin\nfunction pig_latinify(sentence)\n    vowel = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    words = split(sentence, ' ') # split sentence into individual words\n    result = [] \n    \n    @sync begin\n        for word in words\n            push!(result, @spawn piglatin_word(word))\n        end\n        \n        for job in result\n            wait(job)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return join([fetch(job) for job in result], \" \") # join the transformed words back into a sentence\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, we're using `@spawn` macro to create a new task (or thread). We then wait for all tasks to finish by using `wait` function. \n\nThis will ensure that the tasks are executed simultaneously and we can use multithreading.\n\nPlease note that the performance of multithreaded programs heavily depends on your system's capabilities. If you have a lot of data, this might not be as efficient as it could be due to the overhead of thread creation/management.","status":200,"tokens":[0,418],"elapsed":3.677408275,"_type":"aimessage"}]
