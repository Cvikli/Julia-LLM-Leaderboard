[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

This is done in order to take full advantage of the multi-core nature of modern computers and minimize any overhead associated with thread creation or context switching.\n\nEach new process will call the `pig_latin_word` function on the given index, which translates a word into pig latin by moving its initial consonant letters to the end of the word followed by \"ay\". The translated word is then stored back in the shared array.\n\nPlease note that if you want this function to work in an environment with multiple processors/cores, you should run Julia with the `--machine-model=multi` flag. This flag indicates that Julia should generate machine code suitable for a multi-core processor system.\n\nIf you want to use different number of threads than available CPUs, you can set `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` environment variable. For example, if you have 8 cores and you want to utilize only 4 of them, then you should set `JULIA_NUM_THREADS=4`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,575],"elapsed":5.225448594,"_type":"aimessage"}]
