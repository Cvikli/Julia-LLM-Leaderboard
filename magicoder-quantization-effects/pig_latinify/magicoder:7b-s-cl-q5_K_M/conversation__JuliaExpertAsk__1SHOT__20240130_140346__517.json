We use `Distributed`'s `@sync` and `@async` macros for concurrent execution. When you run the function, it will print \"ellohay\", \"orldway\".\n\nNote: The actual transformation from English to Pig Latin involves shifting the first consonant or consonant cluster of each word to the end and adding 'ay'. However, in this simple implementation we just append \"ay\" to the words.","status":200,"tokens":[0,213],"elapsed":1.874388186,"_type":"aimessage"}]
