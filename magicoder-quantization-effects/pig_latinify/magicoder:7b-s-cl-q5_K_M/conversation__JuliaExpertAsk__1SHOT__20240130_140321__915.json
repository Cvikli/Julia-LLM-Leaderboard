It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example solution written in Julia programming language:\n```julia\nusing Threads, Distributed\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    function transform_word(word)\n        first_letter = word[1]\n        if first_letter isa Char && first_letter âˆˆ 'aeiou'\n            return \"$(word)way\"\n        else\n            return \"$(word[2:end])ay $(word[1])\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    Threads.@threads for word in words\n        println(transform_word(word))\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this function, `transform_word` is a helper function which transforms one word into pig latin. It checks if the first letter of the word is a vowel or not. If it's a vowel, it simply appends \"way\" to make it pig latin. Otherwise, it moves all the characters starting from the second character and then appends them with the first character followed by \"ay\".\n\n`Threads.@threads for word in words` makes sure that these transformations are run on separate threads. The results will be printed out one after another as they're ready.","status":200,"tokens":[99,270],"elapsed":2.399042894,"_type":"aimessage"}]
