Then we use the `map` function from the Base.Iterators module, which applies `translate_word` to each element of `words` in parallel (because it's running on multiple threads thanks to Threads), and finally we convert the result to an array with `|> collect`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,260],"elapsed":2.29096579,"_type":"aimessage"}]
