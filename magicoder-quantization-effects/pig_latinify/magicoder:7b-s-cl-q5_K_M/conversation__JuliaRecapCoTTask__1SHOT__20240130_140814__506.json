[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a solution written in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    @sync for word in words\n        @async println(pig_latin_translation(word))\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_translation(word::AbstractString)\n    if length(word) > 1 && isalpha(first(word))\n        first_letter = word[1]\n        rest_of_word = word[2:end]\n        return \"$(rest_of_word)$(first_letter)ay\"\n    elseif length(word) == 1 && isalpha(word)\n        return \"$(word)ay\"\n    else\n        return word\n    end\nend\n```\nThe function `pig_latinify` iterates over each string in the vector of strings using a loop. For each string, it creates a new thread (task in Julia parlance) to translate that string into pig latin using `pig_latin_translation`. This allows for translations to occur concurrently.\n\nThe function `pig_latin_translation` checks if the word is more than one character long and starts with an alphabetic character, then it transforms that word into pig latin by appending the first letter at the end of the rest of the word and adding \"ay\". If the word is only one character long or not alphanumeric, it simply returns the original word.\n\nThis solution respects the instructions for using `@sync` to manage asynchronous operations across multiple threads. It also uses `@async` to create a new task that will run concurrently with other tasks. \n\nPlease replace {{instructions}} with your specific requirements and constraints in this context, as they could influence the solution significantly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,398],"elapsed":3.576248031,"_type":"aimessage"}]
