This array will hold the results from each thread.\n- It then runs an asynchronous loop over the input strings where each string is processed in a separate thread. For each string, it calls the inner `pig_latinify` function to transform that string into pig latin and stores the result back into the shared array.\n- Finally, it returns all of the transformed strings as a single string separated by spaces.\n\nThe inner `pig_latinify` function does something similar but for each individual word in the input string:\n- It splits the input string into words.\n- It then creates another shared array to hold the transformed words from different threads.\n- It runs an asynchronous loop over these words and, in each iteration, adds \"ay\" at the end of a word and stores it back into the shared array.\n- Finally, it joins all the transformed words together into a single string and returns that string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,490],"elapsed":4.27525526,"_type":"aimessage"}]
