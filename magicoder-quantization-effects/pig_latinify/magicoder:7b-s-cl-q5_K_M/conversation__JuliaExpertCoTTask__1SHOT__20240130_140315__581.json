Then we define a function `pig_latinify` that takes a string as an argument and converts it into pig latin. We use `@everywhere begin ... end` to broadcast the definition of the `pig_latinify` function to all available threads.\n\nWe also have a main function, which creates an array of words and then runs a for loop that starts new tasks (threads) for each word in the array. The `@sync` macro makes sure that these tasks are executed sequentially, not concurrently (i.e., one task finishes before another one is started). \n\nEach task calls `pig_latinify(words[i])` and prints out its result, which is the word in pig latin.","status":200,"tokens":[0,358],"elapsed":3.146878859,"_type":"aimessage"}]
