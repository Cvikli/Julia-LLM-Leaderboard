It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example using Python's concurrent futures module:\n\n```python\nimport concurrent.futures\n\ndef pig_latinify(words):\n    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:\n        translations = list(executor.map(lambda word: _pig_latinify(word), words))\n    return translations\n\ndef _pig_latinify(word):\n    if word[0] in 'aeiou':\n        return f\"{word}way\"\n    else:\n        return f\"{word[1:]}{word[0]}ay\"\n```\n\nIn this example, the `pig_latinify` function creates a ThreadPoolExecutor for handling concurrent tasks. The `map` method of the executor is used to apply the _pig_latinify function to each word in the input list, and these results are collected into a list using the `list` constructor.\n\nThe `_pig_latinify` function is a helper function that performs the actual transformation for a single word. If the first letter of the word is a vowel, it appends \"way\" to the end; otherwise, it moves the first letter to the end and adds \"ay\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,278],"elapsed":2.429064643,"_type":"aimessage"}]
