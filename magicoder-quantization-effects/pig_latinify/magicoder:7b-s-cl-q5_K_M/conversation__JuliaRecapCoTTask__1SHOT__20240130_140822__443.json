[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Here is the function `pig_latinify` which converts an input string into Pig Latin:\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(str::AbstractString)\n    word = split(lowercase(str)) # split the sentence into words and convert to lower case\n    for i in eachindex(word)\n        if startswith(word[i], 'a') || startswith(word[i], 'e') || startswith(word[i], 'i') || startswith(word[i], 'o') || startswith(word[i], 'u')\n            word[i] = string(word[i], \"way\") # append way to the vowel words\n        else\n            word[i] = string(word[i][2:end], word[i][1], \"ay\") # move first letter of consonant word to end and add 'ay'\n        end\n    end\n    return join(word, \" \")  # join all words back into a sentence with spaces between them\nend\n```\nNow let's create a function that operates on vectors of strings using Julia's `Threads.@threads` for parallel processing:\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify_vector(strings::Vector{String})\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(strings)) # preallocate the result array\n    @threads for i in eachindex(strings)\n        result[i] = pig_latinify(strings[i]) \n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\nYou can use this function to convert a vector of strings into Pig Latin as follows:\n```julia\nstrs = [\"Hello\", \"World\"]\nprintln.(pig_latinify_vector(strs)) # print each word in the sentence\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,421],"elapsed":3.814568126,"_type":"aimessage"}]
