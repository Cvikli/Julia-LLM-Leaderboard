For example:\n\n```julia\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\n```\nThis would output each word transformed into Pig Latin on a separate line.\nPlease note, Pig Latin is traditionally not case sensitive and doesn't consider the first character of words, however this implementation does these adjustments for the sake of simplicity. Also, please make sure you have installed the `Base.Threads` package using the command `]add Base.Threads`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,367],"elapsed":3.179488563,"_type":"aimessage"}]
