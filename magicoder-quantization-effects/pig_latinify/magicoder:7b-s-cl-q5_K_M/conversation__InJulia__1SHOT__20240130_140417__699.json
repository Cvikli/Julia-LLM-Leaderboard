If you'd like to include more complex rules (like treating y as a vowel when it is at the start of a word), this would require additional logic in `pig_latin_transform`.\n\nThe `@async` macro is used to allow the function `pig_latinify` to return before all threads have finished. The Threads.@spawn macro is used to spawn a new task for each word transformation, which allows them to run in parallel on different threads. The result of each thread is collected into an array by the comprehension `[pig_latin_transform(word) for word in words]`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,432],"elapsed":3.770736888,"_type":"aimessage"}]
