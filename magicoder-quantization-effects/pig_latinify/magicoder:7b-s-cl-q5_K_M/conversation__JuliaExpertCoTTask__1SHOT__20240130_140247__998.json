When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The result is an array of transformed words. Each transformation is performed on a separate thread, resulting in parallel execution. \n\nThe pig latin translation scheme is simple: we move the first letter to the end of the word and append \"ay\" to it.","status":200,"tokens":[230,233],"elapsed":9.648486949,"_type":"aimessage"}]
