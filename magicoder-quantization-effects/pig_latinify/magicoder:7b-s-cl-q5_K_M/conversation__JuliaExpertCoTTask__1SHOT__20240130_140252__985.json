It uses `@sync begin ... end` to wait for all threads to finish. The `piglatin_thread` function takes a word and its index, then it changes the first letter of the word to \"ay\" and appends it at the end of the rest of the word. If there are multiple words in the string (indicated by space between them), all remaining words are concatenated with \" \".\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes English language grammar and is not perfectly accurate, as pig latin is a bit more complex than just changing the first letter to \"ay\". However, it should give a good enough demonstration of how you can use Julia's parallel computing features.\n\nTo run this code:\n```julia\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,473],"elapsed":4.188981547,"_type":"aimessage"}]
