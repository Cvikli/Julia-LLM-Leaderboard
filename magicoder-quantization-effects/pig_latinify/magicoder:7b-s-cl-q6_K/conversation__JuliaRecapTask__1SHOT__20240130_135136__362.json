[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is an implementation of the task in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)\n    @sync begin\n        for str in strings\n            @async print(pig_latinify(str))\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(word::AbstractString)\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    if islowercase(first_letter)\n        return string(word, \"ay\")\n    elseif isuppercase(first_letter)\n        return uppercase(string(word[2:end], first_letter, \"ay\"))\n    end\nend\n```\nIn the above code snippet, we define a `pig_latinify` function that takes in an array of strings. We use `@sync begin ... @async ... end` construct for threading. For each word in the array, a new task is spawned with `@async print(pig_latinify(word))`.\n\nThe inner `pig_latinify` function checks whether the first letter of the input string is uppercase or lowercase and converts it to pig latin accordingly. The check for capitalization is needed because in Pig Latin, only the first letter of a word should be capitalized while others are not.\n\nPlease note that this code will print the transformed strings one by one on separate lines due to the asynchronous nature of the tasks. If you want all transformed words printed together (possibly with newline characters), you might need to modify it accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[369,340],"elapsed":3.410612459,"_type":"aimessage"}]
