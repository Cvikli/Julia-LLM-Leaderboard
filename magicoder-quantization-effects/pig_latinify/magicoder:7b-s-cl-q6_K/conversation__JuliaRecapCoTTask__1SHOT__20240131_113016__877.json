[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

We then create the main function `pig_latinify` which accepts a vector of strings as input. Inside this function, we use `@sync begin ... end` to ensure all asynchronous tasks are executed in order. For each string in the input vector, we spawn an asynchronous task using `@async`, which will run on a separate thread.\n\nThe `pig_latinify` helper function is defined with `@everywhere` so that it can be accessed from any worker process (including those created by `@sync`). This is necessary because Julia's multi-threading model does not allow functions to be called asynchronously on different threads unless they are defined in the global scope.\n\nPlease note, this code assumes that you have a basic understanding of the pig latin language and how it works. The `pig_latin` function is not included here because its implementation depends on the specific rules of pig latin you want to apply.","status":200,"tokens":[0,388],"elapsed":3.816556577,"_type":"aimessage"}]
