It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nimport Base.Threads.@spawn\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    @sync for (i, word) in enumerate(words)\n        result = @spawn pig_latin(word)\n        results[i] = fetch(result)\n    end\n    return results\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word::String)\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    rest_of_word = word[2:end] * \"ay\"\n    return \"$rest_of_word $first_letter\"\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, the `pig_latinify` function uses `@spawn` to create a new thread for each word in the input vector. The `pig_latin` function is then called on each word in its own thread. The results are collected into a new array and returned. \n\nPlease note that this code assumes that words are separated by spaces, as per standard English grammar rules. If your input strings can have punctuation or other non-alphabet characters, you'll need to modify the `pig_latin` function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,289],"elapsed":2.755758937,"_type":"aimessage"}]
