Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    @sync begin\n        for string in strings\n            @async begin\n                println(\"Pig latinified version of $string is \", pig_latin(string))\n            end\n        end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(s::String)\n    words = split(s, \" \")\n    pig_latin_words = [pig_latin_word(w) for w in words]\n    return join(pig_latin_words, \" \")\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_word(w::String)\n    if islowercase(first(w)) || first(w) == '!'\n        return string(w[2:end], w[1]) * \"ay\"\n    elseif isuppercase(first(w))\n        return string(w[2:end], w[1]) * \"Ay\"\n    end\n    return string(w, first(w)) * \"ay\"\nend\n```\nThis code defines a function `pig_latinify` that takes in a vector of strings and prints out the pig latin version of each string. It uses `@sync begin ... end` to ensure that all threads are joined before the main thread continues. Each string is processed by an asynchronous task (`@async begin ... end`) which runs on a separate thread.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function splits the input string into words, and then applies the `pig_latin_word` function to each word. The `pig_latin_word` function checks if the first character of the word is uppercase or lowercase, and adjusts the translation accordingly.\n\nPlease note that this code doesn't actually modify the original vector of strings in place; instead, it prints out the pig latin version of each string. If you want to modify the original vector, you would need to add a line to assign the result back to the original variable: `strings = pig_latinify(strings)`.","status":200,"tokens":[142,477],"elapsed":12.500730159,"_type":"aimessage"}]
