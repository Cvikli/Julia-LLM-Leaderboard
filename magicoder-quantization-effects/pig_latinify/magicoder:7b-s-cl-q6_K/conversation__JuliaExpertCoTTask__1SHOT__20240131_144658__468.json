This solution uses a Channel to pass the transformed words back from the worker threads. It's important to note that this is not actually multi-threaded in the sense of running on separate CPU cores, but it does run in parallel because of Julia's async programming model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,348],"elapsed":3.352260906,"_type":"aimessage"}]
