[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Note, however, that Python's threading capabilities are not well-suited to tasks like this one because they tend to be slower and less reliable than their multiprocessing counterparts due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). Also, Python doesnâ€™t support true parallelism because of its GIL. Here, I will demonstrate how you could use Julia's multi-threading capabilities for a similar task.\n\n```python\ndef pig_latinify(words):\n    vowels = 'aeiou'\n    first_vowel_indices = {word: next((i for i, char in enumerate(word) if char.lower() in vowels), len(word)) \n                           for word in words}\n    \n    return [f\"{word[first_vowel_indices[word]]}{word[:first_vowel_indices[word]][1:]}{'ay'}\" if word.lower() not in vowels \n            else f\"{word}ay\" for word in words]\n```\n\nHowever, Julia is designed to perform concurrent programming and has libraries that allow us to achieve true parallelism:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    results = Channel{String}(length(words))\n    \n    @spawnat 2 begin\n        vowels = 'aeiou'\n        first_vowel_indices = Dict()\n        \n        for word in words\n            if !haskey(first_vowel_indices, word)\n                index = next((i for i in 1:length(word) if lowercase(string(word[i])) in vowels), length(word))\n                first_vowel_indices[word] = (index == length(word) ? -1 : index) # If no vowel, set to -1. This will be useful later on in the else clause\n            end\n        end\n        \n        for word in words\n            if lowercase(string(first_vowel_indices[word])) in vowels || first_vowel_indices[word] == -1\n                put!(results, string(word)*\"ay\")\n            else\n                put!(results, string(word[first_vowel_indices[word]+1:end]*\"ay\", word[1:first_vowel_indices[word]]))\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    piglatinwords = [take!(results) for _ in words] # This will block until all results have been received\n    return piglatinwords\nend\n```\n\nRemember, this is Julia pseudo-code.
