X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latin` helper function checks whether the first letter is a vowel or not, and transforms words accordingly. \n\nRemember that Julia is designed for concurrency which means it will use multithreading by default when creating new tasks. So, `@async` will spawn a new task running on a separate thread. `@sync` ensures that all the asynchronous tasks started within its block are completed before proceeding to the next line.\n\nYou can call this function with an array of strings:\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\"]\npig_latinify(words)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,298],"elapsed":2.944258866,"_type":"aimessage"}]
