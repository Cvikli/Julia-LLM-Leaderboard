For each string in the vector, it creates a new string by moving the first character to the end of the string and appending \"ay\". This new string is the pig latin version of the original word. The `@threads` macro from Julia's Threads package is used to run the for loop on separate threads.\n\nHere is how you can use this function:\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"banana\"]\npig_latinify(words)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,212],"elapsed":2.037906682,"_type":"aimessage"}]
