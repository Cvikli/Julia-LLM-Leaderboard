[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function splits the input into words, then applies the `pig_latin` function to each word in a separate thread.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function transforms a single word to Pig Latin: if it starts with a vowel, it adds \"way\" at the end; otherwise, it moves the first letter to the end and adds \"ay\".\n\nYou can specify special instructions in the second argument of `pig_latinify`. This could be used for example to add more rules or change the behavior of the program. \n\nPlease note that this is a very basic implementation and doesn't cover all possible cases in Pig Latin (for instance, it does not handle punctuation or capital letters). It also assumes words are separated by spaces.","status":200,"tokens":[0,485],"elapsed":4.77896999,"_type":"aimessage"}]
