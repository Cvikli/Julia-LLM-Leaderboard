The transformation is done by splitting the string into words, then appending \"ay\" to the end of each word (making sure to capitalize the first letter if it was originally uppercase). The result is then joined back together with spaces in between.\n\nThe `@threads` macro from Julia's Base.Threads package allows us to run this loop over the strings in parallel, which can significantly speed up the process for large vectors of strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,295],"elapsed":2.85445809,"_type":"aimessage"}]
