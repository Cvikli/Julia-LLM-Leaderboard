Pig Latin is a language game where we move the first consonant or consonant cluster (like \"qu\") to the end of the word and then add \"ay\". If a word starts with a vowel, just add \"way\" at the end.\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    @sync begin\n        for word in words\n            @async begin\n                if lowercase(word[1]) âˆˆ 'aeiou'\n                    println(\"$(word)way\")\n                else\n                    println(\"$(lpad(word,2))ay\")\n                end\n            end\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\nThe `@sync` macro ensures that the function doesn't return until all threads have finished. The `@async` macro lets Julia know to create a new thread for the block of code it's used in. `lpad(word,2)` just adds two spaces before each word to make sure the output is aligned correctly when printed.\n\nLet's test this function with an array of strings:\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"orange\", \"grape\"]\npig_latinify(words)\n```\nThe output will be:\n```\nappleway\norangeway\ngrapeay\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,305],"elapsed":2.955455177,"_type":"aimessage"}]
