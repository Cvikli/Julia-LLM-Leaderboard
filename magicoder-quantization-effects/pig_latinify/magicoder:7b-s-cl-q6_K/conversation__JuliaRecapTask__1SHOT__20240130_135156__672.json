[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

If a word starts with a vowel, \"way\" is added at the end. Here's how we can solve this task using Julia's multi-threading capabilities:\n\n```julia\nusing Transform\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    @threads for word in words\n        vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n        first_letter = word[1]\n\n        # Check if the first letter is a vowel, and if so, add \"way\" at the end.\n        if first_letter in vowels\n            println(word * \"way\")\n        else\n            # If not, move all letters starting with a vowel to the end of the word.\n            for i = 2:length(word)\n                letter = word[i]\n                if letter in vowels\n                    new_word = String(word[i+1:end]) * word[1:i-1] * \"ay\"\n                    println(new_word)\n                    break\n                end\n            end\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\nYou can then call this function with a vector of words you want to transform into Pig Latin. Here's an example of how you might use it:\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"orange\", \"banana\"]\npig_latinify(words)\n```\nThis will print out the pig latin equivalents of each word in the array on separate lines.\n\nNote that this is a simple solution and doesn't handle some more complex cases (like punctuation or multiple spaces between words), but it should work fine for most basic inputs.","status":200,"tokens":[0,427],"elapsed":4.235217296,"_type":"aimessage"}]
