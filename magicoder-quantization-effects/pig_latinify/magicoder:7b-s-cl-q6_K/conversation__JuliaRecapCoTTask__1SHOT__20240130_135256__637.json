[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It iterates over each word in the provided vector of strings. For every word, it uses `@spawnat :any` to start a new thread that will run on any available processor. The worker function `pig_latin_worker` is defined elsewhere in this script and takes an AbstractString as input, which represents one word from our original sentence. It then applies the rules of Pig Latin to the word.\n\nThis solution uses multiple dispatch to ensure that our pig latin program works seamlessly for both words and strings that start with capitalized letters. The `@showprogress` function is used to give a visual indication of how many words have been processed. If you want to print status updates, replace this line with a normal `println` call.\n  \nRemember, the pig latin program assumes that words are separated by spaces and punctuation like commas or periods shouldn't be present in the input strings. For more complex scenarios (like sentences), additional programming would be required.","status":200,"tokens":[0,580],"elapsed":5.647751985,"_type":"aimessage"}]
