If the word starts with a vowel (either lowercase or uppercase), it appends \"ay\" to the end of the word and leaves the rest as is. If the word starts with a consonant (either lowercase or uppercase), it moves that character to the end of the word, adds \"ay\", and leaves the rest as is.\nThe function `pig_latinify` takes in a vector of strings and uses `@sync for str in strs @async pig_latinify(str)` to apply the `pig_latinify` function on each string in parallel using threads. \nPlease note that `@everywhere` macro is used to ensure that the function `pig_latinify` can be accessed from all workers.","status":200,"tokens":[0,454],"elapsed":4.354443086,"_type":"aimessage"}]
