It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example solution in Julia:\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    @sync begin\n        for str in strings\n            @async begin\n                println(\"$stray\" * popfirst!(split(str, \" \")))\n            end\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `@sync` macro to ensure that all threads are joined before returning. Each string is split into words and the first word is popped off (using `popfirst!`) before being appended to the end of each pig latin word in a separate thread using `@async`. The result is printed out.\n\nPlease note, this function assumes that you want to convert every word in the input string to pig latin and it doesn't handle punctuation or capitalization. Also, it does not return anything as `println` outputs directly to the console. If you need to return a value, you would have to modify this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,219],"elapsed":2.086220079,"_type":"aimessage"}]
