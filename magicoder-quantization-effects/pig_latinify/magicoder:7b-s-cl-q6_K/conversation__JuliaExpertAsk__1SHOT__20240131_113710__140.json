It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n@everywhere using Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    @sync begin\n        for word in words\n            @async begin\n                println(\"Pig Latin translation of '$word' is: \", pig_latin(word))\n            end\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word::String)\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    rest_of_word = word[2:end]\n    \n    return \"$rest_of_word$first_letteray\"\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, we use the `@sync` macro to ensure that all asynchronous tasks started by `@async` are executed in order. Each task is defined as an anonymous function that translates a single word into pig latin and prints it out.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function takes a string and returns its translation into pig latin. It works by taking the first letter of the input string, appending it to the rest of the string (without the first letter), and then adding \"ay\" at the end. \n\nNote: This is just an example and does not take into account actual rules of Pig Latin. The rules for Pig Latin are more complex than this simple transformation.","status":200,"tokens":[0,306],"elapsed":2.916461485,"_type":"aimessage"}]
