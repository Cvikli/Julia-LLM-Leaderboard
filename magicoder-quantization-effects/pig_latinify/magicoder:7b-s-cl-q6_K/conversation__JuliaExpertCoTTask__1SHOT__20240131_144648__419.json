[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia code that solves this problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    @everywhere function translate_word(word::String)\n        first_letter = word[1]\n        rest_of_word = word[2:end]\n        \n        if islowercase(first_letter)\n            return \"$rest_of_worday $first_letter\"\n        else\n            return \"$rest_of_worday $first_letteray\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Start a new process to translate each word in parallel\n    results = pmap(translate_word, words)\n    \n    # Combine the results into one vector and return it\n    return vcat(results...)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by creating a new Julia process for each string in your input list. The `@everywhere` macro ensures that this function is available to all processes, so they can call it without having to define it again. \n\nIn each process, the `translate_word` function takes a single word and translates it into pig latin. If the first letter of the word is lowercase, we append \"ay\" to it; if it's uppercase, we append \"Ay\". The result is then returned back to the main process where it gets combined with the rest of the results from other processes using `vcat`.\n\nPlease note that this code would not work on Julia 1.0 as it does not support `@everywhere` macro. You need to use Julia 1.1 or higher for this.","status":200,"tokens":[230,355],"elapsed":9.589000393,"_type":"aimessage"}]
