In Pig Latin, we move the first consonant or consonant cluster (like \"qu\" in English) of an English word to the end and add \"ay\". If a word begins with a vowel, simply add \"way\" at the end. For example, \"hello\" becomes \"ellohay\", \"apple\" becomes \"appleyay\", etc.\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    @showprogress \"Parsing...\" for word in words\n        if isempty(word) || !isalpha(first(word)) \n            continue\n        end\n        first_letter = lowercase(first(word))\n        rest = word[2:end]\n        if occursin('a', first_letter) || occursin('e', first_letter) || occursin('i', first_letter) || occursin('o', first_letter) || occursin('u', first_letter)\n            output = string(rest, first_letter*\"ay\")\n        else\n            output = string(first_letter*rest, \"ay\")\n        end\n        print(output * \" \")\n    end\nend\n```\nPlease note that this function uses `@showprogress` macro to show progress bar.\n\nNow let's see how we can run it on a separate thread for each word:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify_threads(words)\n    threads = Vector{Threads.Thread}()\n    for word in words\n        t = @async begin \n            if isempty(word) || !isalpha(first(word))\n                continue\n            end\n            first_letter = lowercase(first(word))\n            rest = word[2:end]\n            if occursin('a', first_letter) || occursin('e', first_letter) || occursin('i', first_letter) || occursin('o', first_letter) || occursin('u', first_letter)\n                output = string(rest, first_letter*\"ay\")\n            else\n                output = string(first_letter*rest, \"ay\")\n            end\n            print(output * \" \")\n        end\n        push!(threads, t)\n    end\n    \n    for thread in threads \n        wait(thread)  # Wait for each thread to finish\n    end\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,544],"elapsed":5.285418599,"_type":"aimessage"}]
