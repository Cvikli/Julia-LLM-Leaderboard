The `pig_latinify` function uses `@sync begin ... @async` to run each iteration of the loop on a separate thread. The `pig_latin` function checks whether the first letter is a vowel, and if it is, moves the first letter to the end and adds \"ay\". If the first letter isn't a vowel, then it moves all letters after the first one to the end of the word and adds \"ay\".\n\nWhen you call `pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])`, it prints each word transformed into pig latin on separate lines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,318],"elapsed":3.058815762,"_type":"aimessage"}]
