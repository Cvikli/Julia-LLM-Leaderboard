It then uses the Python concurrent.futures module to create a ThreadPoolExecutor, which allows it to run each word transformation operation on a separate thread. \n\nThe `pig_latin_word` function is called for each word using the map method, and its result is added to a list. Finally, this list of transformed words is returned by `pig_latinify`.\n\nIf the first letter of a word is a vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u'), it appends \"ay\" to the end of the rest of the word and returns the result. If the first letter is not a vowel, it moves this letter to the end of the word and adds \"ay\".\n\nWhen you call `pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])`, it will return `['elloHay', 'applepay', 'strongngray', 'orldway']`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,395],"elapsed":3.892245826,"_type":"aimessage"}]
