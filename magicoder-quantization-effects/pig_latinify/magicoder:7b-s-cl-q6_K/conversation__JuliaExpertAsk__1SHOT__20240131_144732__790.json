It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can do this in Julia using the Threads module:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    results = zeros(Int, length(words))\n    @sync for (i, word) in enumerate(words)\n        r = @spawnat :any results[i] = convert_to_pig_latin(word)\n    end\n    return results\nend\n\nfunction convert_to_pig_latin(word::String)\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    rest = word[2:end] * \"ay\"\n    return \"$rest $first_letter\"\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, `pig_latinify` takes a vector of words and returns an array of their Pig Latin translations. It does this by using the `@sync` macro to ensure that all threads are joined before it attempts to use the results. Each word is processed in its own thread with `@spawnat :any`. The result of each conversion is stored into the corresponding position in `results`, which is shared across all threads.\n\nThe `convert_to_pig_latin` function takes a string and transforms it to Pig Latin. It moves the first letter to the end, appends \"ay\", and adds a space between the rest of the word and the transformed first letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,308],"elapsed":2.95454858,"_type":"aimessage"}]
