[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the code for your problem:\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n@everywhere begin  # Use @everywhere to distribute this function across multiple processors.\n    function pig_latinify(strs::Vector{String})\n        return [pig_latin_word(w) for w in strs]\n    end\nend\nfunction pig_latin_word(w::String)\n    if length(w) == 0   # If word is empty, return as is\n        return \"\"\n    elseif islowercase(first(w))  # If first letter of the word is lowercase, append \"way\" at the end.\n        return string(w[2:end], w[1], \"ay\")\n    else   # First letter of the word is uppercase, convert it to lowercase and append \"ay\".\n        return string(w[2:end]*lowercase(first(w)), w[1], \"ay\")\n    end\nend\n```\nThis script firstly imports the `Distributed` package which allows us to work on different processes. Then, `@everywhere begin ... end` block is used to define a function `pig_latinify()` that is then distributed across all available processors using `@distribute`. Inside this function, we have another function `pig_latin_word(w::String)` which transforms each word into Pig Latin. \n\nYou can run it with:\n```julia\n# Add processors as needed\naddprocs(2) # Adds two new processes to the cluster.\n@everywhere using Distributed\n@distributed pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\n```\nNote that this solution will only work properly if all strings are lower case, or if you want to keep capital letters intact, you might need a more sophisticated function to handle these cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,427],"elapsed":4.200095028,"_type":"aimessage"}]
