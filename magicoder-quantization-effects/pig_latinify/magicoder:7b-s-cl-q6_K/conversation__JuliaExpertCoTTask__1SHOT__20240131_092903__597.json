It then starts a separate thread for each word in the input list and puts them into the channel. The main thread takes each word from the channel, transforms it into pig latin, and adds it to the result vector.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function works by splitting the word into its constituent parts (the first vowel and everything that comes after) and then reversing them. It then returns the pig latin version of the word.","status":200,"tokens":[0,334],"elapsed":3.279584337,"_type":"aimessage"}]
