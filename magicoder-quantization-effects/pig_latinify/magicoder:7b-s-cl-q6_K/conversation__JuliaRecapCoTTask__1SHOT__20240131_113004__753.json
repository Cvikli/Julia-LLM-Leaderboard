[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example solution in Julia using the Threads package:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    @threads for word in words\n        println(pig_latin_word(word))\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_word(word)\n    if length(word) > 1\n        first_letter = word[1]\n        rest_of_word = word[2:end]\n        return \"$rest_of_word$first_letteray\"\n    else\n        return \"$worday\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn this solution, the `pig_latinify` function uses `@threads` to create a new thread for each word in the input vector. The `pig_latin_word` function is then called on each word by the thread. This function takes a single word as input and returns the pig latin version of that word.\n\nPlease note that this solution doesn't actually return anything, it just prints out the transformed words. If you want to store the results in an array or another data structure, you would need to modify this code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,261],"elapsed":2.577625413,"_type":"aimessage"}]
