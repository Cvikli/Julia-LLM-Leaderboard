Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    @sync begin\n        for string in strings\n            @async begin\n                println(pig_latin(string))\n            end\n        end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(s::String)\n    words = split(s, ' ')\n    pig_words = [pig_latin_word(w) for w in words]\n    return join(pig_words, \" \")\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_word(w::String)\n    if islowercase(first(w))\n        return string(w[2:end], w[1], 'ay')\n    else\n        return string(w[2:end], first(w), 'ay')\n    end\nend\n```\nThis code defines a function `pig_latinify` that takes in an array of strings. It then uses `@sync begin ... @async begin ... end` to ensure all threads are properly synchronized. \n\nThe `pig_latin` function splits the input string into words, and applies the `pig_latin_word` function to each word. The `pig_latin_word` function takes a word, checks if it starts with an uppercase letter (indicating that it's capitalized), and then transforms it accordingly. If it starts with a lowercase letter, it treats the first character as the initial consonant group and moves it to the end of the word followed by 'ay'.\n\nPlease note that this code is not tested for correctness or efficiency. It's just an illustration of how you could implement such functionality in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[0,401],"elapsed":3.835497403,"_type":"aimessage"}]
