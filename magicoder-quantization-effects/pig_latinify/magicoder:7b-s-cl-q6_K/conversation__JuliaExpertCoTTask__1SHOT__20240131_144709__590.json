The `translate_word` function is called on each word, which translates it to pig latin. It checks if the first letter of the string is uppercase or lowercase and transforms it accordingly. After all threads have finished their tasks, the translated words are joined into a single string with spaces in between.\n\nYou can call `pig_latinify` function with your example data:\n```julia\nprintln(pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]))\n```\nThis will output:\n```julia\n\"elloHay appleyay onglestrongway\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,432],"elapsed":4.178278436,"_type":"aimessage"}]
