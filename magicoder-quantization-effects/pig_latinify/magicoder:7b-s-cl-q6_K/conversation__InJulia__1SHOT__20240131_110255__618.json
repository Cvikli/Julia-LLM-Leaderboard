Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem in Julia using the Threads package for multithreading:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    # Create a function to transform a single word into pig latin\n    function convert_word(word)\n        first = word[1]\n        rest = word[2:end]\n        return \"$rest$firstay\"\n    end\n    \n    # Convert each string in the vector using multithreading\n    result = Threads.@threads [convert_word(split(word, \"\")) for word in words]\n\n    return join.(result)\nend\n```\nThis function splits each string into a list of characters and then applies the `convert_word` function to each character list. The `Threads.@threads` macro is used to run this operation on multiple threads.\n\nPlease note that you need to install the Threads package if it's not already installed, you can do so by running `Pkg.add(\"Threads\")` in your Julia console.","status":200,"tokens":[0,241],"elapsed":2.321031733,"_type":"aimessage"}]
