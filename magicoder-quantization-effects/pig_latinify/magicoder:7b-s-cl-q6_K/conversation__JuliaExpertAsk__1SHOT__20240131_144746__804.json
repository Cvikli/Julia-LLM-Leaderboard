The function `pig_latinify` takes a vector of strings as input, then iterates over each string in parallel using `@async`. Inside each iteration, the word is transformed into pig latin by calling the `pig_latin` function.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function works by taking the first letter of the word and appending it to the end of the rest of the word followed by \"ay\".\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\npig_latinify(words)\n```\nThis will print out each word transformed into pig latin on a new line.","status":200,"tokens":[0,298],"elapsed":2.85692098,"_type":"aimessage"}]
