The `pig_latinify` function is applied concurrently on multiple workers using `@async`. The transformed strings are sent back through a channel to the main process for collection.\n\nPlease note that this code requires Julia 1.6 or later, as it uses the `Transduce` package which was introduced in Julia v1.6.\nAlso, make sure you have the `Distributed` and `Transduce` packages installed by running the following commands:\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"Distributed\")\nPkg.add(\"Transduce\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,517],"elapsed":4.980241343,"_type":"aimessage"}]
