The computation is done in parallel using the Distributed package. \n\nThe `pig_latinify_worker` function is responsible for distributing the workload among workers and collecting results. It runs on a separate thread for each worker, ensuring that each string gets transformed to pig latin independently.\n\nFinally, `pig_latinify` transforms an individual word into pig latin according to its rules.","status":200,"tokens":[0,425],"elapsed":4.089989839,"_type":"aimessage"}]
