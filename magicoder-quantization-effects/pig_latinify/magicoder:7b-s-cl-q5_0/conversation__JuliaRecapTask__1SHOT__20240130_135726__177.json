[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `@threads` macro from Julia's Threads package is used here to run these operations in separate threads.\n\nEach word gets changed to Pig Latin according to a specific set of rules:\n- If the first letter of the word is a vowel, add 'way' to the end of the word.\n- If the first letter of the word is an uppercase vowel, add 'way' to the end of the word.\n- If the first letter of the word is not a vowel, move all initial consonant letters to the end and append 'ay'.\n\nThis function assumes that words are separated by spaces in the input strings, but it should work correctly with other separators as well.","status":200,"tokens":[0,778],"elapsed":7.086743459,"_type":"aimessage"}]
