[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"This task involves multithreading in Julia. However, Julia does not directly support concurrent execution of threads within one process because this can lead to race conditions and other problems with shared memory. \n\nBut if you still want to achieve it, you could use the package `ThreadsX`.\n\nBelow is an example:\n\n```julia\nusing ThreadsX\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    @sync for word in words do \n        @spawn pig_latin(word)\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word::String)\n    first = word[1]\n    rest = word[2:end]\n    \n    # Rule for consonant ending word\n    if islowercase(first) && !('a' <= first <= 'z') && first != 'y' \n        return string(first, rest, \"ay\")\n    end\n    \n    # Rule for vowel starting word\n    if isuppercase(first) || (islowercase(first) && ('a' <= first <= 'z'))\n        return string(rest, first, \"ay\") \n    else\n        return string(rest, word, \"ay\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function creates a separate thread for each word in the input vector. Each thread calls the `pig_latin` function with the corresponding word from the vector. The `@sync` macro ensures that all threads are joined before returning from the `pig_latinify` function. \n\nThe `pig_latin` function is where you would define how a word transforms into pig latin. This function should take a single string as input, and return its transformation to pig latin as an output.","status":200,"tokens":[0,400],"elapsed":3.524721409,"_type":"aimessage"}]
