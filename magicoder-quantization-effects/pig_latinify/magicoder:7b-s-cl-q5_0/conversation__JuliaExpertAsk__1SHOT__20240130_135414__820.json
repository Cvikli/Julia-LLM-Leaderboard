Then, it creates a vector of sample words to transform into Pig Latin. The next step is to define the main function `dist_pig_latinify`. This function applies the pig_latinify function to each string in a distributed manner using `@distributed for` and `pmap`. Finally, it runs this function on the vector of strings using `@sync @distributed for`.\n\nPlease note that you need at least one worker process running when you call `nprocs() > 1 || error(\"Need at least one worker process\")`, otherwise the script will fail.","status":200,"tokens":[0,413],"elapsed":3.55871701,"_type":"aimessage"}]
