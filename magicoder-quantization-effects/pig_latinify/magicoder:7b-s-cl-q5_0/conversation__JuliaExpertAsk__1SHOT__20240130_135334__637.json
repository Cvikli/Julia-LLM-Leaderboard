It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can achieve this using Python's concurrent.futures module:\n\n```python\nimport concurrent.futures\n\ndef pig_latinify(words):\n    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:\n        translations = list(executor.map(pig_latin_word, words))\n    return translations\n\ndef pig_latin_word(word):\n    if word[0] in 'aeiou':\n        return f'{word}way'\n    else:\n        return f'{word[1:]}{word[0]}ay'\n```\nThis script defines a `pig_latinify` function that takes as argument an iterable of words. This function uses the `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` to run the `pig_latin_word` function on each word in parallel. Each word is translated into pig latin by adding 'ay' at the end, unless it starts with a vowel in which case 'way' is added. \n\nPlease note that Python is not multi-threaded like Julia, but we use `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` to simulate multithreading as it allows us to write cleaner code and get the same result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,285],"elapsed":2.464879232,"_type":"aimessage"}]
