It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, we can use the `@sync` macro to ensure all threads are joined before returning from the function. Here's how you could implement this:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    @sync for (i, word) in enumerate(words)\n        r_id = addprocs(1)[1]\n        @spawnat r_id begin\n            results[i] = piglatinify(word)\n        end\n    end\n    return results\nend\n\nfunction piglatinify(word::String)\n    # Pig Latin rules:\n    # 1. If a word starts with a vowel, add \"ay\" to the end of it.\n    # 2. If a word does not start with a vowel, move all letters that come before the first vowel to the end and add \"ay\".\n    \n    if islowercase(word[1]) && (word[1] in 'a':'z')\n        return string(word, \"ay\")\n    elseif !islowercase(word[1]) && (word[2] in 'a':'z')\n        return string(word[3:end], word[2], word[1], \"ay\")\n    end\n    return word # No changes if the word starts with a non-alphabet character or is already in pig latin\nend\n```\n\nThis `pig_latinify` function will run all operations on separate threads, each one converting one string to Pig Latin. Note that it's important to make sure your strings are not modified in place (as the word might be used by multiple threads), so we create a new `results` vector and fill that instead.","status":200,"tokens":[0,406],"elapsed":3.49550062,"_type":"aimessage"}]
