[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the code snippet for the task:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    @sync begin \n        for word in words\n            @spawnat rand() print(pig_latinify_word(word))\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_word(word)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    word_array = collect(word)\n    if first(word_array) in vowels\n        return word * \"way\" \n    else\n        return string(word[2:end] * word[1]) * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n```\nThis code uses Julia's Distributed module to run the pig_latinify function on separate threads. Each thread processes a single word in the input vector. If the first letter of the word is a vowel, it adds 'way' at the end. Otherwise, it moves the first letter to the end and appends 'ay'.\n\nPlease note that this solution might not work well for very large inputs because creating new threads in Julia could be expensive (especially on systems with limited resources). Also, parallelism comes with additional overheads as it involves communication between different processes. For larger data or more complex tasks, you might want to consider other parallel processing libraries.\n  \nAlso note that this is a simple implementation and doesn't handle punctuation or capitalization properly. For real-world use cases, you should also add error checking and handling for invalid inputs.","status":200,"tokens":[0,353],"elapsed":3.114292766,"_type":"aimessage"}]
