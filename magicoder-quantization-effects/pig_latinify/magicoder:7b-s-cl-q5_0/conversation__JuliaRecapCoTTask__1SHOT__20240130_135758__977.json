[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, I will use Julia's built-in concurrency capabilities via its `Threads` package for creating multiple threads and `Base.Threads.@threads` macro for parallel computations. \n\nHowever, please note that Julia is not known for heavy multithreading because of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). However, if your task allows it, this would be a good way to utilize concurrency in Julia.\n\nBelow I present the general structure of how you could approach solving this problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads  # for multithreading support\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    @assert !isempty(strings) \"Input vector must be non-empty\"\n    \n    function transform_string(str::String)::String\n        words = split(str, ' ')  # Split string into words\n        transformed_words = pig_latinify.(words)  # Apply pig_latinify to each word\n        join(transformed_words, ' ')  # Join the words back together with spaces\n    end\n    \n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(strings)\n        strings[i] = transform_string(strings[i])\n    end\n    \n    return strings\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(word::String)::String\n    if startswith(word, ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'])  # If the word starts with a vowel...\n        \"ay\" * word  # Add 'ay' to the end of the word\n    else\n        word[2:end] * word[1]* \"ay\"   # Otherwise, move all letters after the first one to the end and add 'ay' at the start.\n    end\nend\n```\n\nYou can use this function by calling `pig_latinify([...])` where `[...]` is a vector of strings you wish to transform.\n\nRemember, if you have special instructions for this task such as using some specific library or certain approach, please provide them. I will then adjust my solution accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,477],"elapsed":4.181901941,"_type":"aimessage"}]
