[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example solution in Julia using threads:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)\n    nthreads = length(Threads.allthreads())  # get the number of available threads\n    results = Threads.@spawnat (1:nthreads)[Threads.threadid()] begin\n        return map(strings) do str\n            words = split(str, \" \")\n            pig_latin_words = [pig_latin(word) for word in words]\n            join(pig_latin_words, \" \")\n        end\n    end\n    fetch(results)\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word)\n    vowels = [\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"]\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    if first_letter in vowels\n        return string(first_letter, word*\"ay\")  # for words starting with a vowel\n    else\n        return string(word[2:end], first_letter*\"ay\")  # for words starting with consonants\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn the above code, `pig_latinify` is a function that takes an array of strings as input and returns their pig latin translation. It uses Julia's built-in threading features to run each iteration on a separate thread. \n\nThe inner function `pig_latin` translates a word into its pig Latin version. The word is split into letters, the first letter of the word is moved at the end, and then \"ay\" is appended to the rest of the word. If the word starts with a vowel, it simply adds \"ay\" at the end.\n\nReplace `\"{{instructions}}\"` with the actual instructions.\n\nThis solution assumes that the special instructions involve tweaking or adjusting how the pig Latin conversion is done for specific cases. If this isn't the case and you just want a simple implementation of Pig Latin, then simply remove all the lines involving the `pig_latin` function and use the provided code snippet to convert all input words to their Pig Latin form in parallel.","status":200,"tokens":[0,483],"elapsed":4.247470294,"_type":"aimessage"}]
