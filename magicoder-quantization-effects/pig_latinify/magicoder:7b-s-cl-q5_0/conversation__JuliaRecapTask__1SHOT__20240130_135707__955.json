[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple solution for the task using Julia programming language:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed, Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    @sync begin\n        for word in words\n            @async println(pig_latin(word))\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word::AbstractString)\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    remaining_letters = word[2:end]\n    \n    if isuppercase(first_letter)  # Checks if the word starts with an upper case letter\n        return string(remaining_letters, first_letter, \"ay\")\n    else\n        return string(word * \"ay\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function creates a separate thread for each word in the input vector using `@async`. Each thread calls the `pig_latin` function on the current word and prints the result. The `@sync begin ... end` construct ensures that all threads are joined before the main program exits, preventing race conditions.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function changes an input string into pig latin. It checks whether the first letter of the string is uppercase; if it is, the transformed word starts with lower-case letters; otherwise, it remains as it was originally. Then, it concatenates the transformed letters to form a new string.","status":200,"tokens":[369,321],"elapsed":2.869232959,"_type":"aimessage"}]
