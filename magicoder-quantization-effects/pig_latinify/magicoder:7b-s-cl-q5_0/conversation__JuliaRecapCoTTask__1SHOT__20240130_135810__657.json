[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

We'll use Julia's built-in multi-threading capabilities to iterate over the strings on separate threads.\n\nHere is how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n@everywhere using Transduce\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String}, nthreads=Threads.nthreads())\n    # Split each word into an array of characters to apply the transducer\n    transducers = map(string) âˆ˜ split\n    \n    # Define a function to transform English words to Pig Latin\n    # This involves moving the first letter to the end, followed by 'ay' if it is a consonant.\n    piglatin_transducer(word::String) = @match word begin\n        head::Char(isalpha) => \"$head$(tail)\" * \"ay\"\n        _ => word  # If word does not start with an alphabet, return the same word\n    end\n    \n    # Apply the transducer to each word in parallel\n    result_chunks = pmap(1:length(words), nthreads) do i\n        words[i] |> transducers |> map(piglatin_transducer)\n    end\n    \n    # Flatten the chunks into a single vector of translated words\n    result = reduce(vcat, result_chunks)\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\nThe `@everywhere` macro is used to make `piglatin_transducer` available on all threads. The `Transduce` package provides the `|>` operator which lets you apply a transducer to data. In this case, we are applying a transducer that splits each string into an array of characters, and another one that applies our Pig Latin transformation. \n\nThe `pmap` function is used with a range from 1:length(words) which creates separate tasks for each word to be transformed concurrently. The number of threads to use is controlled by the second argument to `pmap`. \n\nThis code assumes that the input list contains only alphabetic words and ignores any non-alphabetic characters or special symbols.","status":200,"tokens":[0,524],"elapsed":4.649606511,"_type":"aimessage"}]
