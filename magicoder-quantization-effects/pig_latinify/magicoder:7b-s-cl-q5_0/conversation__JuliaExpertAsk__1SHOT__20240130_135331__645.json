Here's how you could implement it:\n\nFirstly, we need to import required packages.\n\n```julia\nusing DistributedArrays, Concurrency\n```\n\nThen letâ€™s define our function `pig_latinify`:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    @everywhere begin\n        function pig_latinify(str::String)\n            words = split(str, ' ')\n            new_words = [pig_latin(word) for word in words]\n            return join(new_words, \" \")\n        end\n        \n        function pig_latin(word::String)\n            if isempty(word) || first(word) == 'a' || first(word) == 'e' || first(word) == 'i' || first(word) == 'o' || first(word) == 'u' \n                return word * \"ay\"\n            else\n                return word[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    darr = DistributedArray(strings)\n    map!(pig_latinify, darr)\nend\n```\n\nThis function splits the input `strings` into distributed arrays and applies `pig_latinify` to each of them. Inside `pig_latinify`, we define a helper function `pig_latin` that transforms an English word into pig latin. It checks if the first letter is a vowel, in which case it appends \"ay\" at the end; otherwise it moves all consonants to the end and add the initial letter followed by \"ay\". \n\nYou can call this function with your vector of strings:\n```julia\nstrings = [\"apple\", \"orange\", \"banana\"]\npig_latinify(strings)\n```\nIt should return `[\"applaay\", \"orangeyay\", \"ananabay\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[99,471],"elapsed":4.111006403,"_type":"aimessage"}]
