[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Here's how you might write the `pig_latinify` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::AbstractVector{<: AbstractString})\n    @async for string in strings\n        println(string |> translate_to_pig_latin) # asynchronously print each translation\n    end\nend\n\nfunction translate_to_pig_latin(word::AbstractString)\n    words = split(word, \" \")  # Split the word into individual words\n    for (i,w) in enumerate(words)\n        if isvowel(first(w)) || i == 1\n            append!(words, w)\n        else\n            prepend!(words, w)\n        end\n    end\n    return join(reverse(words), \" \") # Reverse the order of the words and reassemble it into a string.\nend\n\nfunction isvowel(c::AbstractChar)\n    c âˆˆ 'aeiouAEIOU'\nend\n```\nThe `pig_latinify` function uses `@async for ... end` to run each iteration on a separate thread, and the helper functions `translate_to_pig_latin`, `isvowel`, and `join` are used to transform individual words into pig latin.\nPlease note that Julia's multi-threading is not as straightforward as Python's due to its low level access, so it might require some adjustments for your specific use case.\n  \nAlso, this function does not return a value because strings are printed out rather than being returned. If you want to capture the output of each transformation, you could redirect the IO or use something like `Base.print_as_fn` or `IOContext(devnull, :compact => true)`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,414],"elapsed":3.28232226,"_type":"aimessage"}]
