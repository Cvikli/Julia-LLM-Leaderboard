[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is one way you can solve this task in Julia using the Threads package for multithreading:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads, Dict, Unicode  # Import necessary packages.\n\nfunction pig_latinify(str::AbstractString)\n    word = split(str, ' ')   # Split string into words.\n    return join([pig_latinify_word(w) for w in word], ' ')  # Join words back into a string.\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_word(word::AbstractString)\n    if occursin(\"$word\", r\"^[AEIOUaeiou]*$\")   # Check if the word is made up of vowels only.\n        return \"$worday\" * word  # If so, add \"way\" to the end.\n    elseif occursin(r\"^[bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyzBCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXYZ]*$\", word)   # Check if the word is a consonant or vowel cluster at the start of the word.\n        return \"$(word[2:end])$(word[1])ay\"  # If so, move the first letter to the end and add \"ay\".\n    else\n        return \"$(word[end-1:end])$(word[1:end-1])ay\"  # Otherwise, move the last consonant or vowel cluster to the end and add \"ay\".\n    end\nend\n\n# Apply pig_latinify on each word in parallel.\nThreads.@threads for i = 1:length(str_vector)\n   str_vector[i] = pig_latinify(str_vector[i])\nend\n```\nHere, the function `pig_latinify` is applied on a vector of strings using multithreading. Each word in each string is processed sequentially, but each string is done concurrently (thanks to multithreading). This allows for efficient processing even with larger input sizes.\n\nPlease note that this code snippet will not work as expected if the words are not separated by space or the sentence ends with a punctuation mark. You may need to add some additional preprocessing steps depending on how you want your function to behave in these cases.","status":200,"tokens":[403,521],"elapsed":16.65797842,"_type":"aimessage"}]
