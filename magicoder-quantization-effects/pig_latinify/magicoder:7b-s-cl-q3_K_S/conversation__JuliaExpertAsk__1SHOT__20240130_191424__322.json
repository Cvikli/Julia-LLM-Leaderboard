Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I can help you with this problem. The following is a possible solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    remotes = workers()\n    \n    @sync @distributed for str in strings\n        pig_latinified_str = pig_latin(str)\n        println(\"Translated '$str' to pig latin as '$pig_latinified_str'.\")\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(s::String) \n    vowels = [\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"]\n    \n    words = split(s, ' ')\n    pig_latin_words = String[]\n    \n    for word in words \n        first_letter = word[1] in vowels ? word : string(word[2:end], word[1])\n        \n        push!(pig_latin_words, first_letter * \"_\" * word)\n    end\n    \n    return join(pig_latin_words, ' ')\nend\n```\n\nIn the above code block, `pig_latinify` is a function that takes in a vector of strings and translates each string to pig latin. It uses the `@distributed for` construct to run iterations on separate threads. \n\nThe `pig_latin` function is an auxiliary function that takes a word and transforms it into its pig latin equivalent. It does this by adding \"_\" to the front of the word if the first letter isn't a vowel, else just shifting all letters in the string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,378],"elapsed":3.006312822,"_type":"aimessage"}]
