It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In order to solve this problem, we can use Julia's built-in parallel computing capabilities (Threads package) and the `punct` package for splitting the words by punctuation. Here is an example of how you might do it:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\nusing Punctuation\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    # Define a function to be run on each string in parallel\n    transformer(str) = begin\n        split_punct = punct(str);\n        words = split.(split_punct, \" \");\n        for i=1:length(words)\n            words[i] = string(\"\", words[i][2], \"-\", words[i][1])\n        end\n        join(words, \" \")\n    end\n\n    # Create a vector of threads\n    threads = Vector{Threads.Task}(undef, length(strings))\n\n    # For each thread, assign it to transform one string\n    for i=1:length(threads)\n        threads[i] = Threads.Thread(transformer, strings[i])\n    end\n\n    # Start all threads and wait for them to finish\n    Threads.runnables(threads);\n    Threads.waitall()\n\n    # Return the transformed strings\n    return [t.result for t in threads]\nend\n```\nThis code creates a separate thread for each string in the vector, applies our transformation function (which just shifts the first two letters of each word to the end) and then waits for all threads to complete before returning their results.\nNote: This solution assumes that words are only separated by spaces. For more complex rules such as punctuation or multiple spaces separating words, you would need to adjust the `transformer` function accordingly. Also remember to install the necessary packages (`Punctuation`) using Julia's package manager before running this script.","status":200,"tokens":[0,426],"elapsed":3.226209932,"_type":"aimessage"}]
