It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how this could be accomplished in Julia:\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads, Transducers\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    transducer = Map(x -> pig_latin_transformer(x)) â¨³ Map() do x end\n    Threads.@threads for word in words\n        result = collect(transducer(word))\n        println(result)\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_transformer(word)\n    if length(word) > 1 && isalpha(first(word)) && all(isalpha, word)\n        word = word * \"ay\"\n    elseif !all(isalpha, word)\n        word = \"\"\n    end\n    return word\nend\n\nwords = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\"]\npig_latinify(words)\n```\nThis code defines a function `pig_latinify` that accepts an array of strings as input. Each string is processed by the function `pig_latin_transformer`, which takes each word and translates it to pig latin. The result is then printed out in the console.\n\nThe `@threads` macro from Base.Threads library is used for parallel execution on multiple threads.\n\nThis is a fairly simple implementation where words with more than one character that start with a vowel (like 'apple' or 'banana') get added an \"ay\", while other words are left unchanged. This is done in each thread iteratively and in the end, all results are printed out.","status":200,"tokens":[0,355],"elapsed":2.817848333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
