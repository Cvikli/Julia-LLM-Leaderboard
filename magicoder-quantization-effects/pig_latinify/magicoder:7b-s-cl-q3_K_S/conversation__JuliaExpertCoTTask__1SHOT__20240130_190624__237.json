It first checks if there are any vowels in the string; if not, it simply appends 'way' to the end of the input. If there are vowels and there is more than one vowel, it moves all consonant sounds following the first vowel at the end of the word, puts a vowel (in this case, 'a') in front of them, and then appends 'ay'.\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function uses `partition` to divide the strings into chunks and run translation on each chunk separately in separate threads using Julia's parallel processing features. The transformed words are then concatenated back together with the `mapreduce` function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,536],"elapsed":4.346727339,"_type":"aimessage"}]
