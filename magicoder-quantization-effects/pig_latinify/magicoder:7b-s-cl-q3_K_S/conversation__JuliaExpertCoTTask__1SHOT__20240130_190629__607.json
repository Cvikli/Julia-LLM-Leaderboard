We need to wrap the strings in `ThreadsTask` because we can't directly modify global variables (like results array) from different threads. We then use `TranscodingArray` to apply our function on these tasks. \n\nIn `pig_latinify_string`, it first splits the input string into words. Then for each word, it checks if it's a lowercase English word that is not already transformed into Pig Latin, or an uppercase English word followed by a number that hasn't been transformed yet. In such cases, it adds \"ay\" to the end of the word and returns the modified string. If the word is neither uppercase nor lowercase (like \"apple\"), or if it ends with a letter already, it just appends \"_says\" at the end. \n\nFinally, `pig_latinify` takes an array of strings as input and returns another array after applying `pig_latinify_string` on each thread.","status":200,"tokens":[0,561],"elapsed":4.539524901,"_type":"aimessage"}]
