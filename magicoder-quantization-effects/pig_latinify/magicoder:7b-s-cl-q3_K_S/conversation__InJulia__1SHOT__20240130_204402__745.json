It doesn't handle punctuation or capitalization. Also, the performance gain from multithreading might not be significant for small input vectors.\n\nYou can call `pig_latinify` function like below:\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"orange\", \"banana\"]\nprintln(pig_latinify(words)) # prints ['elppaay', 'angeroraay', 'ananabay']\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,357],"elapsed":2.707886049,"_type":"aimessage"}]
