[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pmap` function is particularly useful in this case as it allows us to apply a function concurrently across multiple threads. \n\nBelow is an example of how you could create such a function:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed, Base.Threads: @spawn\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::AbstractVector{<: AbstractString})\n    Threads.nthreads() > 1 || error(\"This function requires multiple threads\")\n    \n    function transform(str)\n        # split the string into words\n        words = split(str, ' ')\n\n        # transform each word to pig latin\n        for i in eachindex(words)\n            word = words[i]\n            \n            # if the word starts with a vowel append \"ay\" at the end otherwise move the first letter to the end and append \"ay\". \n            words[i] = occursin(\"^[aeiou]\", first(word)) ? string(word*\"ay\") : string(word(lastindex(word)):first(word)*\"ay\")\n        end\n        \n        # join the transformed words back together into a sentence\n        return join(words, ' ')\n    end\n    \n    # apply transform to each string in parallel using pmap \n    results = pmap(transform, strings)\n    \n    return results\nend\n```\n\nThis function will work on an array of strings where it transforms every word in the sentence to pig latin. It is important to note that Julia is inherently single-threaded by design for most tasks but it allows you to spawn new threads for specific CPU-bound tasks like this one.\n\nPlease replace `{{instructions}}` with your special instructions if necessary.","status":200,"tokens":[0,398],"elapsed":3.145627738,"_type":"aimessage"}]
