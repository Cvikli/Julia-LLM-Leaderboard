It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, the multi-threading can be achieved using the Distributed and Threads modules. Here's an example of how you could implement `pig_latinify` function with multithreading:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    @threads for word in words\n        # Split the word into two parts at the first vowel or consonant found, if any.\n        vowels = ('a':'z') âŠ» ('A':'Z')\n        split_pos = findfirst(ch -> ch in vowels && isletter(ch), word)\n\n        # If no vowel/consonant was found, just add \"ay\" at the end.\n        if split_pos === nothing\n            transformed = string(word, \"ay\")\n        else\n            prefix = word[begin:split_pos]\n            suffix = word[split_pos+1:end]\n            transformed = string(suffix * word[begin], prefix * \"ay\")\n        end\n        println(transformed) # Or do whatever with each transformed word\n    end\nend\n```\nIn the above function, `@threads for ...` syntax will automatically distribute tasks to all available threads. This can dramatically improve performance when dealing with a large number of strings.\nPlease note that it's important to be careful with threading in Julia, as it may sometimes lead to unexpected behavior due to shared state and race conditions. Make sure you understand the implications before using this feature.","status":200,"tokens":[142,342],"elapsed":9.423167393,"_type":"aimessage"}]
