The `pig_latinify` function first splits each string into words using the `split` function. Then it maps over these words and prepends \"ay\" to every word (except the first word) using the `map!` function. After that, it joins all the transformed words back into a single string with the `join` function. \n\nThe `|>` symbol is used for right-to-left composition which is equivalent to left-to-right composition in Python or Java. In Julia, `|>` is an infix operator for function composition, which means that the result of one function call is passed as argument to another function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,277],"elapsed":2.08142432,"_type":"aimessage"}]
