[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I'll write the function in Julia as you asked. We use the `Threads.@threads` macro to parallelize our computation:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    @threads for word in words\n        if length(word) > 1 && isletter(word[end]) && !isletter(word[1])\n            println(\"$worday\")\n        elseif length(word) == 1 || (length(word) > 1 && isletter(word[1]))\n            println(\"$(word)$(word[1:end-1])ay\")\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this function, we iterate over each word in the input array. If the last character of the word is a letter and if the second to last character is not (as would be the case for a word like \"apple\"), we append \"ay\" at the end of the word. If the first character is a letter and it's a standalone word or there are no letters before it, we move that letter to the end and attach \"ay\". If none of these conditions holds true, the function will just print out the original word. \n\nThis function will work on multiple words in separate threads concurrently, but remember that writing to `STDOUT` (like `println`) is not thread-safe, so the order in which the words are printed may not be what you'd expect.","status":200,"tokens":[0,314],"elapsed":2.476774773,"_type":"aimessage"}]
