Here is an example how your problem could be solved:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::AbstractVector{String})\n    Base.Threads.@threads for string in strings\n        pig_latinified = pig_latin(string)\n        println(\"'$(string}' in Pig Latin is '$(pig_latinified}'\")\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word::String)\n    words = split(word)\n    for (i, word) in enumerate(words)\n        if i == 1 # first word\n            words[i] *= \"ay\"\n        else\n            words[i] = string(\"\", words[i][2:end], words[i][1]) .* \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n    return join(words)\nend\n```\n\nThis code defines a `pig_latinify` function that operates on vector of strings in parallel. It uses the `@threads` macro from Base.Threads package to run iterations over the collection in separate threads. The `pig_latin` function takes an input string, and returns the transformed string in pig latin. \n\nRemember, in Julia you must declare types for your variables explicitly, this is important especially while dealing with multiple threading as it can cause race conditions.","status":200,"tokens":[0,324],"elapsed":2.564974549,"_type":"aimessage"}]
