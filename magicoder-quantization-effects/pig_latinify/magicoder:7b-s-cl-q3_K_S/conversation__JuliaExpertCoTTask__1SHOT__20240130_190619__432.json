Please note that, in Python, thread creation may not be available due to GIL (Global Interpreter Lock), it is better to use process in such scenarios.\n\nThis code creates a new process for each input string and uses them concurrently. As a result, the function can handle an arbitrary amount of inputs efficiently. However, remember that Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) can limit the parallelism in a multi-core processor scenario.","status":200,"tokens":[0,399],"elapsed":3.205641892,"_type":"aimessage"}]
