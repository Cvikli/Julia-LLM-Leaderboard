Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"This problem requires knowledge in multithreading in Julia, as well as a good understanding of the English language. The solution would be:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strs::Vector{String})\n    @async begin\n        for str in strs\n            print(pig_latin(str))\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word::String)\n    words = split(lowercase(word), ' ')\n    newwords = String[]\n    for word in words\n        firstletter = first(word)\n        restofword = word[2:end]\n        newword = restofword * firstletter * \"ay\"\n        push!(newwords, newword)\n    end\n    return join(newwords, ' ')\nend\n```\nThis code defines a function `pig_latinify` that accepts an array of strings. It spawns a new task that iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. The function `pig_latin` takes a word, breaks it down into the first letter and the rest of the word, then appends \"ay\" at the end of the word except for the first letter (which gets placed at the end). Finally, it joins all transformed words back together with spaces in between.","status":200,"tokens":[0,291],"elapsed":2.29256257,"_type":"aimessage"}]
