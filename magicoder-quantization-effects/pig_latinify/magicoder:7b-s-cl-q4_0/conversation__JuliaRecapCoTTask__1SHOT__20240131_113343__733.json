[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The transformation is done in parallel by creating multiple threads (using `@async` and `put!`/`take!`). Each thread calls the `pig_latinify_word` function, which applies the pig latin rules to an individual word.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_word` function checks if a word starts with a vowel or consonant using regular expressions and then applies the appropriate transformation rule.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that words are only composed of lowercase letters. If you need to handle uppercase letters, numbers, punctuation, etc., you would need to modify the `pig_latinify_word` function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,445],"elapsed":3.471442047,"_type":"aimessage"}]
