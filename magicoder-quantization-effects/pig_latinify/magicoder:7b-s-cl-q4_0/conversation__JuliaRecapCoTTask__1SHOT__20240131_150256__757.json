[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads, Dierckx\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    \n    @threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        word = words[i]\n        if isalpha(word[1]) # ensure the word starts with a letter\n            first_letter = lowercase(first(word))\n            rest = word[2:end] * \"ay\"\n            result[i] = string(first_letter, rest)\n        else\n            result[i] = word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a vector of strings as input and returns a new vector with the same length. It uses Julia's `@threads` macro to run each iteration in a separate thread. If the first letter of the string is an alphabet, it converts the word to pig latin (moving the first letter to the end followed by \"ay\"), otherwise it leaves the word as is.\n\nRemember that this function doesn't handle punctuation or capitalization properly. For a complete solution, you may want to add additional functionality to handle these cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,288],"elapsed":2.222239517,"_type":"aimessage"}]
