[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution in Julia programming language:\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n@everywhere using Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    @distributed for word in words\n        first_letter = word[1]\n        remainder = word[2:end]\n        \n        # Check if the word starts with a vowel \n        if contains([\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"], first_letter)\n            \"$remainderay\" * first_letter\n        else\n            \"$first_letteray\" * remainder\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\n\nHere, the `@distributed` macro is used to apply the function on separate threads for each word in the array. The `contains` function is a helper function that checks whether a string contains a specific character (in this case a vowel). \n\nWhen a word starts with a vowel, \"ay\" is appended before the first letter; otherwise, \"ay\" is appended after the first letter. \n\nFinally, an example of using `pig_latinify` function is provided:\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]\nprintln.(pig_latinify(words))\n```\nPlease note that this solution assumes the words only contain letters and no other characters.","status":200,"tokens":[230,304],"elapsed":19.249148948,"_type":"aimessage"}]
