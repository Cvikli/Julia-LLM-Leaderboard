It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(strings))\n    @threads for i in eachindex(strings)\n        str = strings[i]\n        words = split(str, ' ')\n        new_words = map(words) do word\n            if islowercase(word[1])\n                string(word[2:end], word[1], \"ay\")\n            elseif isuppercase(word[1])\n                string(word[2:end], word[1], \"Ay\")\n            else\n                string(word, \"ay\")\n            end\n        end\n        results[i] = join(new_words, ' ')\n    end\n    return results\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a vector of strings as input and returns another vector. Each word in the original vector is transformed into pig latin. The transformation works by checking if the first letter of each word is uppercase or lowercase and then appending \"ay\" to it accordingly. \n\nThe `@threads` macro from Base.Threads package is used for parallel computing, meaning that this function will run faster on a multicore CPU.","status":200,"tokens":[0,289],"elapsed":2.167031532,"_type":"aimessage"}]
