It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could write the function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    @sync begin\n        for string in strings\n            @async println(pig_latin(string))\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    if !('a' <= first_letter <= 'z') && !('A' <= first_letter <= 'Z')\n        return word\n    end\n    is_vowel = first_letter in vowels\n    if is_vowel\n        return string(word, \"way\")\n    else\n        for i=1:length(word)\n            c = lowercase(word[i])\n            if 'a' <= c <= 'z' && !('A' <= c <= 'Z')\n                word = string(word[2:end], word[1], \"ay\")\n                break\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return word\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `@sync` macro to ensure that all of the threads spawned by `@async` are synchronized. Each thread calls `pig_latin` on a different string from the input vector. The `pig_latin` function is responsible for transforming each word into pig latin.\n\nPlease note that this code does not handle punctuation or capitalization, and it only works with English words. You may need to add additional functionality depending on your specific requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,375],"elapsed":2.816487516,"_type":"aimessage"}]
