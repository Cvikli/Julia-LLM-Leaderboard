If a word does not start with a vowel (\"a\", \"e\", or \"i\"), it will return an error message for that word. \n\nPlease note that this is a simple implementation. Pig Latin rules can get more complex, but this should work for most common cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,409],"elapsed":3.09644133,"_type":"aimessage"}]
