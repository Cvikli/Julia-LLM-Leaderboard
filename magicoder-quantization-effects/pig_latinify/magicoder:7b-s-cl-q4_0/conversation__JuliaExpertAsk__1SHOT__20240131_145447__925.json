It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example implementation in Julia using the Threads package:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    @threads for word in words\n        println(\"$worday\")\n    end\nend\n\nwords = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\npig_latinify(words)\n```\nIn this code, `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as input. It uses `@threads for word in words` to iterate over each string in the vector and changes it to pig latin. The `println(\"$worday\")` statement is just an example of how you might transform the word into Pig Latin. You would replace this with your actual logic for converting a word to Pig Latin.\n\nPlease note that Julia's Threads package is experimental as of version 1.0, and the behavior may change in future versions. Also, this function does not return anything because it prints each transformed word directly. If you need to collect all the transformed words together, you should probably use a different approach (like using channels or queues).","status":200,"tokens":[0,244],"elapsed":1.829110645,"_type":"aimessage"}]
