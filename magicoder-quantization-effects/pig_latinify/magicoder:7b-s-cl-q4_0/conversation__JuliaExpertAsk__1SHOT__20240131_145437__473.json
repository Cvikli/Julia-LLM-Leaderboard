It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads, Transducers\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    Threads.@threads for word in words\n        println(pig_latin(word))\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word)\n    vowel = 'aeiou'\n    if occursin(vowel, word[1])  # If the first letter is a vowel\n        return \"$(word)ay\"\n    else\n        return \"$(word[2:end])$(word[1])ay\"\n    end\nend\n```\nThe `pig_latinify` function uses Julia's `@threads` macro to start up to one thread per CPU core. It then iterates over the input vector of words, applying the `pig_latin` function in parallel. The `pig_latin` function checks whether the first letter is a vowel and adjusts the string accordingly.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"orange\", \"grape\"]\npig_latinify(words)\n```\nThis will print out the words translated to pig latin, one per line.","status":200,"tokens":[0,283],"elapsed":2.11735668,"_type":"aimessage"}]
