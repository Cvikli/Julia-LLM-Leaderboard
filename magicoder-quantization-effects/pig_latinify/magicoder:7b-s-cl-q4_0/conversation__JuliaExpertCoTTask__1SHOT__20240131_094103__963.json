The `pig_latin` function checks if the first letter is a vowel or consonant, then transforms the word accordingly.\n\nYou can test this function with your data like so:\n```julia\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,310],"elapsed":3.398411666,"_type":"aimessage"}]
