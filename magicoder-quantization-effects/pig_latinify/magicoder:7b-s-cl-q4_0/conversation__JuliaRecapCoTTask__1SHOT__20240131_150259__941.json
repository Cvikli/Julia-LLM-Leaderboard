[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

This code defines a function `pig_latinify` that takes a vector of strings as input, and returns a new vector with the same strings transformed into pig latin. Pig Latin is a language game where words are moved to the end of sentences and given a \"ay\" sound.\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(words)) # create an empty vector for results\n    \n    @sync begin\n        for (i, word) in enumerate(words)\n            @async result[i] = pig_latin_word(word)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_word(word::String)\n    first_letter = word[1] # get the first letter of the string\n    rest_of_word = word[2:end] # get all other letters in the string\n    return \"$rest_of_worday $first_letter\" # concatenate the rest of the word with \"ay\" and the first letter at the end\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses `@sync begin ... @async` to ensure that the threads are run synchronously, i.e., one thread is not started until the previous one has finished. This ensures that each string in the input vector is transformed into pig latin independently and that the results are stored correctly in the output vector.\n\nEach transformation of a word into pig Latin is done by the `pig_latin_word` function, which takes a string as input, separates it into the first letter and the rest of the string, then concatenates the rest of the string with \"ay\" and the first letter at the end.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the input vector contains valid words (strings). If you need to handle invalid inputs or edge cases, you would need to add additional error checking and handling.","status":200,"tokens":[0,434],"elapsed":3.372868983,"_type":"aimessage"}]
