The transformation from English to Pig Latin is done by adding \"ay\" to the end of each word.\n\nNote: This function prints out the transformed words, but you could easily modify it to store them in an array or another data structure for further processing.","status":200,"tokens":[0,170],"elapsed":1.265188062,"_type":"aimessage"}]
