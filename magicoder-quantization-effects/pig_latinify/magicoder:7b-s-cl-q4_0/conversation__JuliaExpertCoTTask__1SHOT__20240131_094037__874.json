It then creates a new thread for each word in the array, where each thread calls the `translate_word` function to convert the word into pig latin. The result is printed out by each thread.\n\nThe `translate_word` function works by taking the first letter of the string and appending it to the end of the rest of the string, followed by \"ay\". This is the standard way to make words into Pig Latin.","status":200,"tokens":[0,253],"elapsed":3.292632616,"_type":"aimessage"}]
