[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example solution in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    result = Vector{String}()\n    @sync for string in strings\n        push!(result, @async begin\n            words = split(string, ' ')\n            pig_latin_words = [pig_latin_word(word) for word in words]\n            join(pig_latin_words, ' ')\n        end)\n    end\n    return result\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_word(word::String)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    is_vowel = any([c in word for c in vowels])\n    if !is_vowel || (first(word) in vowels && length(word) > 1)\n        return string(word[2:end], word[1], \"ay\")\n    else\n        return string(word, \"ay\")\n    end\nend\n```\nThis `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as input. It then uses `@sync for ... @async begin...` to iterate over each string in the vector and transform it into pig latin on separate threads. The `pig_latin_word` function is used to transform individual words into pig latin.\n\nThe function checks whether the first letter of a word is a vowel or not, and if it's not, then it appends 'ay' at the end of the word. If the first character of the word is a vowel, then it moves all the characters after that to the beginning and append 'ay'.\n  \nPlease note that the function `pig_latinify` doesn't handle punctuation or capitalization in words. The user needs to ensure that they input strings without these issues before using this function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,424],"elapsed":3.293722994,"_type":"aimessage"}]
