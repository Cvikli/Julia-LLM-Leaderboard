Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem using Python's multiprocessing library, which allows you to run tasks in parallel. Here is the code for your task:\n\n```python\nfrom multiprocessing import Pool\n\ndef pig_latinify(word):\n    return f\"{word}ay\" if word[0].lower() not in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'] else f\"{word[1:]}{word[0]}ay\"\n\nwords = [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]\npool = Pool(4) # assuming 4 threads\ntranslated_words = pool.map(pig_latinify, words)\nprint(list(zip(words, translated_words)))\n```\n\nThis code creates a new process for each string in the list to apply the pig latin transformation simultaneously using multiple threads. The result is printed as a list of tuples showing original word and its corresponding Pig Latin translation.\n\nNote that Python's multiprocessing library allows running processes in parallel, but the actual number of threads can be limited by system configuration or library implementation. Also, it should be noted that for large amount of data, multiprocessing may not provide a significant speedup compared to single-threaded approach due to the cost of process creation being quite high.","status":200,"tokens":[0,292],"elapsed":2.193607942,"_type":"aimessage"}]
