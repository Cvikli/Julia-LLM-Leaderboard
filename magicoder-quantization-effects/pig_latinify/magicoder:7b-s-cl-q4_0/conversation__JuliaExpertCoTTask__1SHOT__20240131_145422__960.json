The main function `pig_latinify` creates a ThreadPoolExecutor, which is a pool of threads from which you can submit tasks to be run in parallel. It uses the executor's map method to apply the translate_word function to each word in the input list in parallel. \n\nWhen you run this code with the provided test data, it should print `['ellohay', 'appleyay', 'strongray', 'orldway']`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,271],"elapsed":2.043018855,"_type":"aimessage"}]
