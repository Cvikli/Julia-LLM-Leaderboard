It checks if the first letter of the word is a vowel (indicated by being lowercase and not ending in \"ay\"). If it is, it appends 'ay' to the end of the word, otherwise it moves the first letter to the end of the word followed by 'ay'.\n\nNote: This code assumes that words in the input string are separated by spaces. Punctuation attached to words (like a period at the end) may need additional handling for correct pig latin translation.","status":200,"tokens":[0,451],"elapsed":3.436740447,"_type":"aimessage"}]
