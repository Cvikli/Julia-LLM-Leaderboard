It uses the `@threads` macro to create separate threads for each word in the array. Each thread calls the `pig_latin` function on its assigned word, and then prints out the result.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function is a helper function that transforms an individual word into pig latin. It checks if the first letter of the word is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), and if so, appends \"way\" to the end of the word. If not, it moves the first letter to the end of the word and adds \"ay\".\n\nYou can test this function with your example:\n```julia\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,367],"elapsed":3.632728801,"_type":"aimessage"}]
