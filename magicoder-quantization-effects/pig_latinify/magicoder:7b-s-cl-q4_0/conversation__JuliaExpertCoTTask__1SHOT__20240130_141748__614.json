[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It should output `\"elloHay appleyAy ongrongsTray orldway\"`, which is the Pig Latin version of each word in your input. \n\nNote that this function does not return words in their original order, but all transformations are made concurrently. Also, it doesn't handle punctuation or capitalization in the input words.","status":200,"tokens":[0,249],"elapsed":1.915021768,"_type":"aimessage"}]
