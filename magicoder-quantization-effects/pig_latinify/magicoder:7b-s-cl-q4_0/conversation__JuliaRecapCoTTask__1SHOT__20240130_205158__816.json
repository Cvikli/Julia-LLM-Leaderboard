[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses the `@spawnat` macro to launch each word transformation in a separate process, so the whole thing happens concurrently and is therefore much faster than if we did it sequentially. \n\nPlease note that this solution does not cover all possible edge cases - for example, it doesn't handle punctuation or capitalisation, and it doesn't check whether words are already in pig latin form. It simply converts the first consonant sound to start with an 'ay'. Also, it operates under the assumption that each word is separated by a space.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_word` function takes a string as input and transforms it into pig latin format. The logic is simple: if the first letter of the word (ignoring case) is not a vowel, it adds 'ay' to the end of the word; otherwise, it adds 'way'. The transformed words are then joined back together into one string with spaces between each word. \n\nThe `Distributed` package was used to handle multithreading and distributing the workload across different processes. This is a powerful tool for dealing with large datasets or complex computations where parallelism can greatly speed up processing time.","status":200,"tokens":[0,744],"elapsed":5.713841464,"_type":"aimessage"}]
