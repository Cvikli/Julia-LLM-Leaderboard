[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

However, remember that Julia's `Threads.@threads` construct works by automatically partitioning the iteration over a range of indices into blocks which are then executed in parallel. This is done so automatically that you generally don't have to worry about it when using `@threads`. Here we simply iterate through each index and run the logic on that particular element, but this could be easily modified if you want to do something different for each thread.\n\nPlease note that the Julia language version must be 1.6 or later because of the Unicode support required in the code. If your environment does not meet these requirements, a different approach is necessary such as using external libraries or manually handling string encodings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,335],"elapsed":2.554525836,"_type":"aimessage"}]
