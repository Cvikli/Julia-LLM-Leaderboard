It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\nfunction pig_latinify(str_list::Vector{String})\n    @sync begin\n        for str in str_list\n            @async println(pig_latin(str))\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(s::String)\n    words = split(s, \" \")\n    latins = map(words) do word\n        first_letter = word[1]\n        rest = word[2:end]\n        \"$restay$first_letteray\"\n    end\n    join(latins, \" \")\nend\n```\n\nIn this code snippet, `pig_latinify` is a function that takes in a vector of strings. It uses `@sync begin ... @async ... end` to ensure all the threads are joined properly before returning from the function.\n\nFor each string in the input vector, it spawns a new thread using `@async`. The new thread calls `pig_latin` on the current word and prints the result.\n\n`pig_latin` is another function that takes in a single string. It splits the string into words by spaces, then maps over these words to convert each one to pig latin. Pig Latin is a language game where you take an English word, move the first letter to the end of the word and add \"ay\" onto it.\n\nThis implementation assumes that the input strings do not contain any punctuation or special characters. If they do, you'll need to modify `pig_latin` to handle these cases properly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,361],"elapsed":2.718888735,"_type":"aimessage"}]
