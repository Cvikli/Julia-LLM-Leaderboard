Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    results = fill(\"\", length(strings))\n    @sync begin\n        for (i, string) in enumerate(strings)\n            @async results[i] = pig_latin_transform(string)\n        end\n    end\n    return results\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_transform(s::String)\n    words = split(s)\n    for (i, word) in enumerate(words)\n        if islowercase(word[1])\n            words[i] = lowercase(word * \"ay\")\n        elseif isuppercase(word[1])\n            words[i] = uppercase(word * \"AY\")\n        end\n    end\n    return join(words, \" \")\nend\n```\n\nThis code defines a `pig_latinify` function that takes in a vector of strings. It then creates an empty array to store the transformed strings. Then it uses `@sync begin ... @async ... end` construct to run each string transformation on a separate thread. The result is stored back into the results array.\n\nThe `pig_latin_transform` function takes in a string and transforms it into pig latin. It splits the input string into words, then for each word, it checks if the first character of the word is lowercase or uppercase. If it's lowercase, it appends \"ay\" to the end of the word and makes all letters in the word lowercase. If it's uppercase, it appends \"AY\" to the end of the word and makes all letters in the word uppercase. Finally, it joins all transformed words back into a string with spaces between them.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that each word in a sentence is separated by space. If your input strings can contain punctuation marks or other non-alphabetic characters, you might need to modify `pig_latin_transform` function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,466],"elapsed":3.49609518,"_type":"aimessage"}]
