It starts a new thread for each word in the array, and waits for all threads to finish. For each thread, it calls the function `pig_latinify_word`.\n\nThe function `pig_latinify_word` takes a string as input and transforms it into Pig Latin according to the rules defined earlier: if the word starts with a vowel, add 'way' at the end. If it doesn't, move the first letter to the end and add 'ay'.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\npig_latinify(words)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,370],"elapsed":2.801773742,"_type":"aimessage"}]
