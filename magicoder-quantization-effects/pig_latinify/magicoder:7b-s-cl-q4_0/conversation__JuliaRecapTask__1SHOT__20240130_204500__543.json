[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

For each string in the vector, it transforms it to pig latin by appending the first letter to the end of the word and adding \"ay\". It uses the Transducers package to create a parallelized version of the function, which is run on separate threads with `pmap(Threads)`.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\npig_latinify(words)\n# output:\n# 3-element Vector{Any}:\n#  \"epplay\"\n#  \"ananabay\"\n#  \"errychay\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[403,237],"elapsed":17.310224753,"_type":"aimessage"}]
