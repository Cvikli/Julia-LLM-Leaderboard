It uses the Python concurrent.futures library to execute each word transformation in its own thread, thus achieving parallel processing.\n\nThe `_pig_latinify` helper function checks whether the first letter of the word is a vowel or not. If it's a vowel, the word is transformed into \"way\". Otherwise, it moves the initial consonant to the end and appends 'ay'. \n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```python\nwords = ['apple', 'orange', 'banana']\nprint(pig_latinify(words))\n# Output: ['appleyway', 'orangway', 'ananbay']\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,303],"elapsed":2.275218198,"_type":"aimessage"}]
