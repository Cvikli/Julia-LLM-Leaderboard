The transformation is done by a helper function `_pig_latinify`, which checks whether the first letter of the word is a vowel, and if it's not, it finds the first vowel in the word and moves that vowel to the end of the word, while keeping all other characters the same.\n\nThe `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` context manager automatically manages thread creation and destruction for us, so we don't have to worry about it. The `map()` function applies `_pig_latinify` to each item in the list concurrently.\n\nWhen you run this code with the input [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"], it will output ['ellohay', 'appleyay', 'rongstray', 'orldway'], which are the pig latin versions of the original words.","status":200,"tokens":[0,399],"elapsed":3.939146537,"_type":"aimessage"}]
