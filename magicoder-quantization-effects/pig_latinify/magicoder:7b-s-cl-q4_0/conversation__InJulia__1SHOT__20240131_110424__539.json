Each transformation runs on a separate thread. The `pig_latin` function is used to transform each word individually. It checks if the first letter of the word is a vowel or not, and then appends \"_\" followed by the first letter (uppercase) or the first two letters (uppercase) to the end of the word. If the word starts with a non-vowel letter, it simply returns the original word as pig latin doesn't change words starting with consonants.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\nprintln(pig_latinify(words))  # Outputs: [\"appl_A\", \"ananab_N\", \"errych_R\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,488],"elapsed":3.669137655,"_type":"aimessage"}]
