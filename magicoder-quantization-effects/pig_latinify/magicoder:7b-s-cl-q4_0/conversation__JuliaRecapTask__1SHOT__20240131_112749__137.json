[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    result = Vector{String}()\n    @sync for word in words\n        push!(result, @async begin\n            vowel_indices = [i for (i, c) in enumerate(word) if islowercase(c) && c âˆˆ ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')]\n            if !isempty(vowel_indices)\n                index = first(vowel_indices)\n                return word * \"ay\"\n            else\n                return word[2:end]*word[1]*\"ay\"\n            end\n        end)\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\nThis function takes a vector of strings as input. For each string, it creates an async task that checks the first vowel in the string (if any). If there is a vowel, it appends \"ay\" to the end of the word and returns this new string. If there isn't a vowel, it moves all characters after the first one to the front of the word and then appends \"ay\". All tasks are run concurrently using `@sync` and `begin`. The results are collected into a vector which is returned at the end.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that words only contain lowercase letters and spaces, as per the problem statement. If there could be uppercase letters or other characters in the input strings, you would need to modify it accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,342],"elapsed":2.628631223,"_type":"aimessage"}]
