The transformation is done with multi-threading for efficiency purposes. If the first letter of the word is not a vowel, the first letter is added at the end of the translated word followed by \"ay\". Otherwise, only \"way\" is added to the end of the word.\n\nYou can call this function like so:\n```julia\nstrings = [\"Hello\", \"World\"]\nresult = pig_latinify(strings)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,461],"elapsed":3.531098858,"_type":"aimessage"}]
