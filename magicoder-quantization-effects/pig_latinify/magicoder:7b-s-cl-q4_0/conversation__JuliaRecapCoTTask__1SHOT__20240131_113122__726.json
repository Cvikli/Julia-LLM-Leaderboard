[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this task using Julia's multi-threading capabilities:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    @threads for word in words\n        println(\"Pig Latin translation of '$word': \" * pig_latin(word))\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    \n    if first_letter in vowels\n        return string(word, \"way\")\n    else\n        return string(word[2:end], first_letter, \"ay\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, `pig_latinify` is the main function that takes a vector of strings as input and applies the `pig_latin` function to each word in parallel. The `pig_latin` function checks whether the first letter of the word is a vowel or not. If it's a vowel, it appends \"way\" at the end of the word. Otherwise, it moves the first letter to the end and adds \"ay\".\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that words are separated by spaces in the input vector. If there can be multiple spaces between words or punctuation attached to words, you might need a more sophisticated approach to split the words correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,331],"elapsed":2.570394574,"_type":"aimessage"}]
