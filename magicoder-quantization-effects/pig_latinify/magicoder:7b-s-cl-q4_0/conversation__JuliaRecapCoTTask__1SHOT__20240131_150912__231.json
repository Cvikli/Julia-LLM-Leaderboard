[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Here is an example of how you could implement this:\n\nFirstly, we need to install and import the Threads package if it's not already installed. You can do that with Pkg.add(\"Threads\"). \n\nHere is a simple version of `pig_latinify`:\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    function convert_word(word)\n        first_letter = word[1]\n        rest_of_word = word[2:end]\n        return \"$rest_of_worday\" * first_letter * \"ay\"\n    end\n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        words[i] = convert_word(words[i])\n    end\n    return words\nend\n```\nThis function will work as expected, but it's important to note that the order of elements in the returned vector may not match the original vector due to the multi-threading. If you need to maintain the order or if performance is a concern, you might want to use a different approach.\n\nIf you have special instructions regarding this problem, please provide more detail so I can give a more accurate solution.","status":200,"tokens":[406,287],"elapsed":6.501590692,"_type":"aimessage"}]
