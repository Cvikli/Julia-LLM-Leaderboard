[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin.

The function `_pig_latinify` splits each string into words (using `split`), translates each word to pig latin, and then joins them back together. Each word is translated according to its initial letter's case using the `pig_latin_word` helper function.\n\nThe main loop iterates over the input vector of strings with `@async` on each iteration, creating a separate task for each string translation. The `@sync` directive ensures that all tasks are executed before returning control to the caller.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the first letter of every word is a vowel or a consonant (and not another kind of symbol). If your strings contain symbols, you would need more complex logic to correctly handle them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,508],"elapsed":3.888654491,"_type":"aimessage"}]
