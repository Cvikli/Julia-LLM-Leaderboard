Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can use the Threads package to run code in parallel. Here is how you could write the `pig_latinify` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)\n    result = Vector{String}()\n    \n    @threads for str in strings\n        append!(result, [string(first(str), last(str), \"_ay\")])\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\nThis function takes a vector of strings as input and returns a new vector of the same length. Each string is processed by one thread, resulting in parallel execution. Inside each thread, it creates a new pig latin version of the original string (concatenation of first letter, last letters, and \"ay\") and pushes this to the `result` array. This process is done in-place for efficiency reasons, as Julia doesn't have built-in parallel appends or vector concatenations.","status":200,"tokens":[0,213],"elapsed":1.601308195,"_type":"aimessage"}]
