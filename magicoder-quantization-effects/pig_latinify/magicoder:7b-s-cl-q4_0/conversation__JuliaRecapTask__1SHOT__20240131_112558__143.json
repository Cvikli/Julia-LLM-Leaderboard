[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads, Unicode\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    function translate_word(word)\n        first_letter = word[1]\n        rest = word[2:end]\n        \n        # check if the word starts with a vowel\n        if occursin(r\"^[aeiou]\", lowercase(first_letter))\n            return \"$restay\" * first_letter\n        else\n            return \"$worday\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    Threads.@threads map(translate_word, words)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by defining a helper function `translate_word` that translates a single word into pig latin. This function checks if the first letter of the word is a vowel (in which case it appends \"ay\" to the rest of the word and leaves the first letter as is), or not (in which case it moves the first letter to the end of the word and adds \"ay\").\n\nThe main `pig_latinify` function uses `@threads` from Julia's Base.Threads package to run each translation in its own thread, and then returns a vector with the results.\n\nPlease note that this is just an example. You may need to adjust it according to your specific requirements or constraints. For instance, you might want to handle punctuation differently, or consider words with apostrophes (e.g., \"don't\") differently from words without them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,348],"elapsed":2.802488606,"_type":"aimessage"}]
