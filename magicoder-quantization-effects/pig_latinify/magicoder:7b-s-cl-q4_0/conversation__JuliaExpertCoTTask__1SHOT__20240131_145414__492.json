It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia code solution for this problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    function pig_latin_word(word::String)\n        vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n        if !isempty(word) && word[1] in vowels\n            \"$wordway\"\n        else\n            m = match(r\"([^aeiou]*)(.*)\", word)\n            isnothing(m) && return word # no consonants, keep the same word\n            \"$(m.captures[2])ay$m.captures[1]\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    Threads.@threads for word in words\n        println(pig_latin_word(word))\n    end\nend\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\n```\n\nThis function works by defining a helper function `pig_latin_word` that checks whether the first letter of a word is a vowel. If it is, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word and returns it. If not, it extracts all consonants before the first vowel, adds \"ay\", and then concatenates them with the rest of the word.\n\nThe main function `pig_latinify` uses `@threads` macro from Julia's Threads package to run each iteration on a separate thread. It takes an array of strings as input and prints out the pig latin version of each string.\n\nPlease note that you need to have the Threads package installed in your Julia environment. You can do this with `Pkg.add(\"Threads\")`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,382],"elapsed":2.909403989,"_type":"aimessage"}]
