The `pig_latin` function is a helper function that takes a single word and transforms it into pig latin. It checks if the first two letters are vowels, or if the first letter is a vowel, to determine how to construct the pig latin version of the word.","status":200,"tokens":[0,313],"elapsed":2.332341931,"_type":"aimessage"}]
