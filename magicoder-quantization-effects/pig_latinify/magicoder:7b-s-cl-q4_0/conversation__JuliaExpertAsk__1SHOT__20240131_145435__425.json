It then uses `@sync begin ... @async end` to start multiple threads, each processing one string from the list in parallel. \n\nThe function `pig_latin_word` is used inside the thread to convert a single word into pig latin. This function checks if the first letter of the word is a vowel, and if so, appends \"way\" after it. If not, it moves the first consonant to the end of the word (and adds an 'ay') before adding \"way\".\n\nRemember that this script assumes that words in the input string are separated by spaces. It will not work properly with punctuation attached to words.","status":200,"tokens":[0,374],"elapsed":2.808310981,"_type":"aimessage"}]
