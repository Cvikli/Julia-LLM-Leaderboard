Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can do this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(strings))\n\n    @threads for i in eachindex(strings)\n        word = strings[i]\n        if islowercase(word[1]) || isuppercase(word[1])  # first letter of the word is a consonant or vowel.\n            results[i] = string(word, \"ay\")\n        else\n            results[i] = string(word[2:end], word[1], \"ay\")\n        end\n    end\n\n    return results\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a vector of strings as input and returns another vector where each string has been transformed into Pig Latin. It uses the `@threads` macro to create threads for each iteration, allowing it to run in parallel on multiple cores if available. \n\nThe function checks if the first character of each word is a vowel or consonant (lowercase or uppercase). If it's a vowel or a lowercase consonant, \"ay\" is appended at the end of the word. If it's an uppercase consonant, the first letter is moved to the end and \"ay\" is added.","status":200,"tokens":[0,295],"elapsed":2.20546668,"_type":"aimessage"}]
