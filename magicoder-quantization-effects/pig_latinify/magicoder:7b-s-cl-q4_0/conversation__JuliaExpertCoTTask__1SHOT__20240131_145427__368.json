Then it creates one thread for each word in the input list, and starts them all running simultaneously. Each thread waits for its turn by calling `join()`. At the end of the program, we return a list of all the results from the threads.\n\nPlease note that while this script is simple and illustrates how to use multiple threads in Python, it's not efficient or practical for actual large-scale work due to the overhead involved in creating and managing threads. For real work, you would want to look into multiprocessing (which is similar but creates separate processes instead of threads), or other more advanced parallel computing techniques.","status":200,"tokens":[0,375],"elapsed":2.832934953,"_type":"aimessage"}]
