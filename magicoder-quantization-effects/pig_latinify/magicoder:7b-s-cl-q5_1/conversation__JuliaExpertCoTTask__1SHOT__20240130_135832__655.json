We use the `@async` macro to run an anonymous function asynchronously that sends all words in `words` over this channel.\n\nThen, we have another loop that runs forever (until the channel is closed) and takes each word from the channel. It transforms the word into pig latin (taking the initial letter and moving it to the end with \"ay\") and adds it to our list of pig latin words.\n\nWhen all words are processed, we return our list of pig latin words. \n\nNote: Julia's concurrency model does not directly support parallel processing on a single thread for IO-bound tasks like this one (i.e., reading data from disk or network). However, if you are using multiple threads in your program and the task at hand is computationally expensive, then we could use multiple threads to process words in parallel.","status":200,"tokens":[0,406],"elapsed":3.69174124,"_type":"aimessage"}]
