We then use `@sync begin ... end` to ensure that all tasks start simultaneously. For each word, we spawn a new thread with the `@spawnat 2 thread_word(word)` command. Note that `2` is used because it is assumed that the current machine has two cores.\n\nThe `thread_word` function takes in one string (word) and then splits this into characters to find the initial consonant cluster, which will be moved to the end of the word with \"ay\" added. The transformed word is printed out.\n\nWhen we call `pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])`, it should print:\n```shell\nellohay appleyay rgounstrongway\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,341],"elapsed":3.107005274,"_type":"aimessage"}]
