[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Each string is transformed to pig latin by calling the function `pig_latinify_word`. The transformation is performed in parallel using `@async` and `@sync` macros from Julia's Threads package, ensuring each word is processed independently even though it happens in a loop.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_word` function checks if the first letter of the word is a vowel or not. If it is, it appends \"AY\" to the end of the string and makes everything else uppercase; if it's not, then it moves the first letter to the end and appends \"AY\". This is the standard method of translating words into Pig Latin.\n\nPlease replace `{{instructions}}` with your specific instructions if any.","status":200,"tokens":[0,396],"elapsed":3.630245355,"_type":"aimessage"}]
