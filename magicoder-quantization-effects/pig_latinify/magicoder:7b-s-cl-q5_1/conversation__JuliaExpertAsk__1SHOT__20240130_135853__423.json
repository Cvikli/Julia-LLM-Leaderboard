The `@async` macro is used to create an asynchronous task that runs on a separate thread, allowing for parallel execution of transformations. \n\nPlease note that this code doesn't include the logic for `pig_latin` function as it can vary based on specifics of how you want to implement Pig Latin transformation. It is usually simple: if word starts with vowel move first letter(s) and add \"ay\", otherwise move first consonant or vowel sound to the end of the word and add \"ay\".","status":200,"tokens":[99,315],"elapsed":2.873556729,"_type":"aimessage"}]
