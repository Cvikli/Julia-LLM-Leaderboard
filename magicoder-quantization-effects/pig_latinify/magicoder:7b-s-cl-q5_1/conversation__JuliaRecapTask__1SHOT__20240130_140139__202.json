[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Here is an example of how this might look:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed, Transformers\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    # Use the @distributed macro to apply a function on each element of array in parallel\n    results = @distributed for string in strings \n        pig_latin(string)\n    end\n\n    return results\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(s::String)\n    words = split(s, ' ')\n    new_words = map(words) do word\n        if match(r\"^[aeiou]\", lowercase(word)) != nothing\n            string(\"$worday\")\n        else\n            string(word, \"ay\")\n        end\n    end\n\n    return join(new_words, ' ')\nend\n```\n\nIn this code:\n1. `pig_latinify` is a function that takes an array of strings and returns the pig latin versions in parallel using the `@distributed for` construct provided by Julia's Distributed module. \n2. The `pig_latin` function converts one string into pig latin. It splits the input string into words, checks if they start with a vowel (case-insensitive), and applies different transformations based on that condition. If it does, it adds \"ay\" to the end; otherwise, it simply shifts all consonants in the word to the end of the word and appends \"ay\". \n3. `match(r\"^[aeiou]\", lowercase(word))` is used to check if a word starts with a vowel (case-insensitive). If it does, it returns a Match object; otherwise, it returns nothing. \n4. In the end, the function `pig_latinify` applies the pig latin transformation on every string in parallel and collects all transformed strings into a single array.","status":200,"tokens":[0,453],"elapsed":4.141695261,"_type":"aimessage"}]
