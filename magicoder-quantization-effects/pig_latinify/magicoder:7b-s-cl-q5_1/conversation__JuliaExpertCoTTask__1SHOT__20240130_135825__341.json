This is achieved using Julia's multithreading facilities. Each thread computes a pig latin version of the input string using the `pig_latinify_string` helper function.\nThe `@sync begin...end` construct ensures that the main thread doesn't exit until all spawned threads have finished executing. \nThe result is an array containing the pig-Latin versions of the strings in the input array, one per thread.","status":200,"tokens":[0,431],"elapsed":3.917822268,"_type":"aimessage"}]
