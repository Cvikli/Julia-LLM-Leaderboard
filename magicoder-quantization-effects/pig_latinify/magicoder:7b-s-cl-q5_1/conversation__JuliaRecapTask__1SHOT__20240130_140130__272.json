[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"This task is about translating words into Pig Latin, which is a game of linguistics where you move the first letter(s) of each word to the end and add \"ay\". If the original word ends in a consonant cluster (more than one letter), just place the rest of the consonants at the end. If it's a vowel, append \"way\" directly.\n\nHere is an example how you can do this using Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    @sync begin\n        for word in words\n            @async print(pig_latinify(word))\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(word::String)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    first, rest = word[1], word[2:end]\n    if first âˆˆ vowels\n        return \"$restway\"\n    else\n        consonants = collect(filter(!isletter, first))\n        return \"$consonants$restay\"\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this code, we first import the Distributed module which allows us to use multi-threading in Julia. We define a new function `pig_latinify` that takes in a vector of strings and applies another function inside it on each string separately. This is done using `@sync begin @async`.\n\nWe then have our `pig_latinify(word::String)` function, which checks whether the first letter of the word is a vowel or consonant. If it's a vowel, we append \"way\" to the end of the rest of the string; if it's a consonant, we take all the consonants and add them at the end of the rest of the string followed by \"ay\".\n\nYou can call this function with a vector of strings like so: `pig_latinify([\"apple\", \"banana\"])`\n\nThis will output the pig latin translations for each word in the array separately, as they are being translated on different threads.","status":200,"tokens":[0,479],"elapsed":4.440757808,"_type":"aimessage"}]
