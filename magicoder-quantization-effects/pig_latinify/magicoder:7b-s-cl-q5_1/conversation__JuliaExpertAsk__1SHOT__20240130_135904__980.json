It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example solution in Julia programming language:\n\n```julia\nimport Base.Threads.@threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    @threads for word in words\n        println(piglatin(word))\n    end\nend\n\nfunction piglatin(word::AbstractString)\n    first = word[1]\n    rest = word[2:end]\n    return \"$rest$firstay\"\nend\n```\n\nThis `pig_latinify` function applies the `piglatin` function to each string in the provided vector, printing out the result. The `@threads` macro is used to execute the loop iterations on separate threads. \n\nThe `piglatin` function takes a single word and returns it transformed into Pig Latin. This translation works by taking the rest of the word (from index 2 till end) and then appending the first letter of the word at the end. The resulting string is returned as the Pig Latin version of the input word.\n\nPlease note that this solution only prints out the transformed words, if you want to collect all transformed words into a new vector, it needs further modifications.","status":200,"tokens":[0,264],"elapsed":2.294014976,"_type":"aimessage"}]
