X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

However, as per the instructions, the main focus should be on performance and multi-threading. Therefore, using only standard libraries and avoiding any specific packages.\n\nHere is how you could do it:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed;\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    @everywhere function translate(word)\n        # Split word into letters\n        letters = collect(word);\n        \n        # Find the first vowel in word. If none, use 'a' as default\n        vowel = findfirst(isequal(lowercase(letters[1])), \"aeiou\") ? lowercase(letters[1]) : \"a\";\n        \n        return uppercase(vowel) * word[2:end] * \"_ay\"\n    end\n    \n    # Use threads to apply the translate function on every word in the input vector.\n    results = @distributed (threads=true) map(translate, words);\n\n    return join(results, \" \")\nend\n```\nThis code defines a `pig_latinify` function that splits each string into letters and searches for the first vowel in the word (or uses 'a' if none is found). It then returns the Pig Latin translation of the word. The `@everywhere` macro is used to define the `translate` function on all workers, so it can be called from within a distributed computation.\n\nPlease note that this code requires Julia 1.5 or higher for `@distributed (threads=true)`.\n\nThe special instructions might require changes in how we implement the solution based on specific requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,394],"elapsed":3.567702303,"_type":"aimessage"}]
