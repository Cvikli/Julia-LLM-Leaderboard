[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Here's how you can implement it in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\n# Define function for Pig Latin conversion\npig_latinify(str::String) = join([pig_latinify_word(w) for w in split(lowercase(str))], \" \")\n\nfunction pig_latinify_word(w::AbstractString)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    first_char = w[1]\n    \n    # Check if word starts with a vowel or not and return accordingly.\n    if first_char in vowels\n        \"$way\"\n    elseif isletter(first_char)\n        # If it does start with consonant, find the position of first vowel from right side.\n        pos = findlast(v -> v == w[1], vowels)\n        \n        if pos === nothing \n            \"$w$ay\"\n        else\n            \"$(w[2:pos]$first_char$(w[1:(pos-1)])$ay\"\n        end\n    else\n        \"$way\"\n    end\nend\n\n# Use Distributed package to create multiple threads.\naddprocs(4) # use 4 workers for better performance with multiple threads\n@everywhere pig_latinify = $pig_latinify\n\n# Define vector of strings that you want to convert into Pig Latin.\nstrings = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"this\", \"is\", \"a\", \"test\"]\n\n# Use Distributed.@sync and @spawnat for parallel execution on multiple threads.\n@time res = Distributed.@sync [@spawnat i pig_latinify(s) for (i, s) in enumerate(strings)]\n\nprint.(res)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n1. `pig_latinify` function takes a string and transforms it into Pig Latin. It splits the string into words using the `split` function then applies `pig_latinify_word` to each word using list comprehension.\n2. `pig_latinify_word` function does most of the work in translating a single word into Pig Latin. It checks whether the first character is a vowel or not, and if it's a consonant, finds the position of the first vowel from the right side of the word.\n3. The code uses `@spawnat` to create threads for each process (which can run on different cores), and `@sync` to wait until all processes are finished before continuing with the program.\n4. The resulting Pig Latin words are printed out in the end.","status":200,"tokens":[0,654],"elapsed":6.095917165,"_type":"aimessage"}]
