Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can do this using Julia's concurrency facilities:\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    # Create an empty vector that will hold the results\n    result = Array{String}(undef, length(words)) \n\n    @sync for (i, word) in enumerate(words)\n        # Use a Threads.Threads.jl.Task to perform the transformation on each string in a separate thread\n        task = @spawn pig_latinify!(result, i, word)\n        \n        # Make sure we block until the Task is finished\n        wait(task)\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify!(result, index, word)\n    # Perform the transformation here and store the result in the appropriate position of `result`\n    # For simplicity's sake, we will just append \"ay\" to each word.\n    result[index] = word * \"ay\"\nend\n```\nPlease note that you should replace `\"pig_latinify!\"` function with your own logic for transforming a string into pig latin as it is currently not defined here. Also, this implementation doesn't check if the input is correct (e.g., if it's a vector of strings). You might want to add some checks depending on your needs.\nThis example uses `@sync` and `@spawn` macros from Julia's concurrency package Threads.jl. You can use this solution in your Julia environment, but you will need to install the `Threads` package before running it using Pkg.add(\"Threads\").","status":200,"tokens":[0,362],"elapsed":2.831199127,"_type":"aimessage"}]
