[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin.

The `@threads` macro is used to run this loop on different threads, thus increasing performance by utilizing multiple cores.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function takes a string as input. It checks if the first letter of the word is uppercase or lowercase and then transforms it into pig latin according to the rules: \n- If the first letter is uppercase, move it to the end of the rest of the word, add \"ay\" and append it at the beginning of the sentence.\n- If the first letter is lowercase, just move it to the end of the rest of the word and append \"ay\".\nThe transformed pig latin word is then printed out. \n\nPlease note that the special instructions provided would go inside this function body, or outside if not related with threading and string transformation process.","status":200,"tokens":[0,369],"elapsed":2.94405546,"_type":"aimessage"}]
