Here's an implementation of `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings and does each transformation in a separate thread:\n\n```julia\nusing PTools # Import parallel computing package\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    @sync begin\n        for word in words\n            @async pig_latinify(word)\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(word::String)::String\n    # Split the string into words and then join them together to make it easier to handle\n    words = split(word, \" \")\n\n    for i in 1:length(words)\n        word = words[i]\n        # check if the first letter is a vowel\n        starts_with_vowel = (word[1] in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']) ? true : false\n        \n        # Pig Latin rules: If the word starts with a vowel, we just add \"way\" to the end. \n        # Otherwise, we move the first letter to the end and then add \"ay\".\n        words[i] = starts_with_vowel ? \"$(word)way\" : \"$(SubString(word, 2))$(word[1])ay\"\n    end\n    \n    return join(words, \" \") # Join the transformed words back together into a string\nend\n```\nThis code defines two functions: `pig_latinify` that takes in a vector of strings and applies the `pig_latinify` function to each one using multiple threads. The second function, `pig_latinify`, performs the actual transformation on a single word. It checks if the first letter of the word is a vowel, then follows the Pig Latin rules to change it to pig latin.","status":200,"tokens":[0,437],"elapsed":3.425568402,"_type":"aimessage"}]
