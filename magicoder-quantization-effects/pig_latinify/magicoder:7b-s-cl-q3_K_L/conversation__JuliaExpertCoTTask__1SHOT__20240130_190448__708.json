Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the code in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    @sync for word in words\n        Threads.spawn() do \n            println(pig_latin_transform(word))\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_transform(word)\n    vowel = collect(\"aeiou\") # array of vowels\n    word = lowercase(word)\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    if !(first_letter in vowel) \n        word = word[2:end]*first_letter*\"ay\"\n    else\n        word *= \"ay\"\n    end\n    return word\nend\n```\nThis function `pig_latinify` uses `@sync for` to iterate over each string (word) in the input vector and print out the pig latin version of that word. \n\nThe function `pig_latin_transform` is used to convert a single word into Pig Latin form. It checks if the first letter of the word is a vowel or not, and then appends \"ay\" to it accordingly. If the word starts with a vowel, it just adds \"ay\" to the end of the word.\n\nYou can test this function by calling `pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])`. \n\nNote: This code is not suitable for large datasets as Julia's `@sync` and `Threads.spawn()` methods are used which creates a new thread for each word, this can lead to high memory consumption if the dataset is very large. For larger datasets we would need an efficient way to process these tasks in parallel without creating so many threads.","status":200,"tokens":[230,385],"elapsed":19.753619708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
