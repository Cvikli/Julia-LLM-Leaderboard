[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

This code will not run in Julia due to differences in multithreading support, synchronization primitives and lack of built-in string manipulation functions compared to python.\n\nPlease note that this Python program does not handle uppercase or punctuation properly. Depending on your needs, you may need to add additional error checking code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,314],"elapsed":2.544505786,"_type":"aimessage"}]
