It uses `@spawnat 1:nthreads()` to create separate threads for each word in the string array. The word's first character is checked whether it is a vowel or not, and then the word gets transformed into Pig Latin according to its rules. \n\nThis function returns a vector of translated words where each word's Pig Latin version is stored at the same position as it was in the input array. This way it maintains the order of the original vector. \n\nPlease note that in Julia, the `fetch` function is used to retrieve the result from the spawned thread. Also, you need to import Base.Threads module to use `@spawnat` and `nthreads`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,368],"elapsed":2.879195471,"_type":"aimessage"}]
