[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Here's a solution that meets your requirements:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::AbstractVector{<:AbstractString})\n    @sync begin\n        for word in words\n            @async begin\n                println(pig_latin_word(word))\n            end\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_word(word)\n    # Assuming each word begins with a vowel\n    if startswith(lowercase(word), ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')) \n        return \"$(word[2:end])$(word[1])ay\"\n    else\n        return \"$(word[2:end])$(word[1])ay\"\n    end\nend\n```\nIn the above code, `pig_latinify` is defined to take in a vector of strings and apply pig latin transformation on each word using `@async` for multithreading. The `pig_latin_word` function takes a string and transforms it into Pig Latin. \n\nThe `@sync begin ... end` block makes sure that the main thread doesn't exit until all asynchronous threads complete their tasks, which ensures correct execution order.\n\nYou can test the code with:\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\npig_latinify(words)\n```\nThis will print out each word in Pig Latin.","status":200,"tokens":[0,351],"elapsed":2.8363023,"_type":"aimessage"}]
