Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you could implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    @sync begin\n        for word in words\n            @async begin\n                println(pig_latin(word))\n            end\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word)\n    return string(word[2:end], word[1]) * \"ay\"\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, `pig_latinify` is the main function which runs a separate thread for each word in the input vector. The `@async begin ... end` construct starts a new task that will run asynchronously with respect to the parent task.\n\nThe helper function `pig_latin(word)` converts an English word into pig latin by moving the first letter to the end and appending \"ay\". \n\nYou can call this function like so:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"orange\", \"banana\"]\npig_latinify(words)\n```\nThis will print out the pig latin versions of your words.","status":200,"tokens":[0,256],"elapsed":2.064677303,"_type":"aimessage"}]
