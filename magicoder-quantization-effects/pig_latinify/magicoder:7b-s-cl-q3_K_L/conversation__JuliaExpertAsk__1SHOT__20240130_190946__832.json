If a word begins with a vowel, append \"way\" to the end of the word.\n        # 2. Otherwise, take the first letter of the word and move it to the end, then add \"ay\".\n        \n        if startswith(string, [\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"])\n            return string * \"way\"\n        else\n            return string[end-1:end] * string[1:end-1] * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Create a list of tasks for each word in the input vector. \n    tasks = map(transform, strings)\n    \n    # Use ThreadsX.jl to run these tasks on separate threads.\n    results = pmap(tasks) do task\n        return task()\n    end\n\n    # Return the list of transformed words as a single string separated by spaces.\n    return join(results, \" \")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses anonymous functions `transform` for applying Pig Latin transformation to each word of the vector `strings`. It then utilizes `pmap` function from Julia's ThreadsX.jl package to apply transformations on multiple threads.\n\nNote: This code snippet assumes that you have already installed and included the ThreadsX package in your project by running the following command in the REPL console: `]add ThreadsX`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,355],"elapsed":2.873079443,"_type":"aimessage"}]
