The function is then used with the ThreadPoolExecutor context manager from Python's concurrent.futures module, which creates new threads for each task in the map function and waits for them all to complete.\n\nHowever, please note that Python's threading model may not always provide the desired performance benefits due to Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). If you need more speed, consider using multiprocessing instead of multithreading in your code.","status":200,"tokens":[103,401],"elapsed":23.10913171,"_type":"aimessage"}]
