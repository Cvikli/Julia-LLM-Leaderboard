The function `pig_latinify` could be implemented as follows:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    @sync begin\n        for word in words\n            @spawnatDistributed first(word) * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, `@spawnatDistributed` creates a new task on each thread that will run the `first(word) * \"ay\"` operation. \n\nThe `@sync` macro ensures all tasks are completed before returning from the function.\n\nPlease note: Pig Latin is more complex than just appending a suffix to the first letter, especially when dealing with multiple words or sentences. The rules of Pig Latin are much more complex and this simple example only works for single-word strings. \n\nThis code should run in parallel on each thread provided that you have multiple threads available (more than one process). If you want to use all available CPUs, you can use `@distributed` instead of `@spawnatDistributed`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,265],"elapsed":2.13745669,"_type":"aimessage"}]
