[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

This allows us to run the `pig_latinify` function on different threads. \n\nThe function `pig_latinify(word::AbstractString)` takes a single string and applies the pig latin transformation. It checks if the first letter of the word is a vowel (i.e., one of 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u'). If it is, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word; otherwise, it moves the first letter to the end and appends \"ay\".\n\nFinally, we call `pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})` with a vector of strings as input. This function takes each string in the vector and applies the pig latin transformation on a separate thread.","status":200,"tokens":[0,346],"elapsed":2.844824038,"_type":"aimessage"}]
