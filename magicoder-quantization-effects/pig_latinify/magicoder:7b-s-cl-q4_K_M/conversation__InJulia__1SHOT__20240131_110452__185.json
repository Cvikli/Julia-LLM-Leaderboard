It then uses `@async` to create separate threads for each string, and puts the transformed string into a channel. After all threads have finished, it closes the channel and returns a list of transformed strings by reading from the channel.\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function within the loop changes each word in the input string into pig latin. It splits the string into words, gets the first letter of the first word, moves this letter to the end of all other words and adds \"ay\". The transformed string is then returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,388],"elapsed":3.25466267,"_type":"aimessage"}]
