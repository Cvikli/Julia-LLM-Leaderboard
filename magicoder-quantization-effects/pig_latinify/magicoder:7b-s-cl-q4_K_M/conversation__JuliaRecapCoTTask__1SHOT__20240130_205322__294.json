[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Julia does not natively support multithreading. However, the `Distributed` package can be used to implement this functionality.\n\nHere is an example of how you might do it:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    # Start a local cluster if one does not exist yet\n    if !iscluster() \n        addprocs(2) # Adds two additional workers to the cluster\n    end\n\n    # The following is run on each worker\n    @everywhere begin\n        function pig_latinify(word::String)\n            # Implement the pig latin logic here...\n            return word * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    # This sends the work to be done by the workers and collects the results\n    @sync begin\n        for word in words\n            @async remotecall_fetch(pig_latinify, first(workers()), word)\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\nYou can then call this function with a vector of strings to get the pig latinized version. Note that the \"pig latin logic\" is not implemented in this snippet and would need to be added as needed.\n\nPlease, note that this approach has its own overheads (like creating new workers), so it might not be suitable for simple tasks or large datasets.\n\nThe given instructions are not specified here. So, you can adjust the solution based on those instructions if there are any specific requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,334],"elapsed":2.700457205,"_type":"aimessage"}]
