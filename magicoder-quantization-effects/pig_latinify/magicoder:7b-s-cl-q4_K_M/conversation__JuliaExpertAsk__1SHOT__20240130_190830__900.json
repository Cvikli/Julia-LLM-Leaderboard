The `map` function applies the `translate` function to each word in the input vector, resulting in a new vector with the same words transformed into pig latin.\n\nPlease note that you need to have a running Julia compute cluster for this code to work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[0,351],"elapsed":2.83700071,"_type":"aimessage"}]
