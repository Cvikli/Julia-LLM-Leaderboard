[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you might solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    @sync begin\n        for string in strings\n            @async print(pig_latinify_threaded(string))\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_threaded(s::String)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    words = split(s, \" \")\n    for i in 1:length(words)\n        word = words[i]\n        if first(word) in vowels\n            print(\"$(word)ay \")\n        else\n            print(\"$(@sprintf(\"%2.0s\", word)[3:end])ay $(@sprintf(\"%2.0s\", word)[1:2]) \")\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this code, `pig_latinify` is the function that takes a vector of strings as input and prints out each string in pig latin. The `@sync begin ... @async print(pig_latinify_threaded(string)) end` block ensures that all threads are joined before the function returns, preventing potential race conditions.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_threaded` function is where the actual pig latin transformation happens. It splits each string into words and checks if the first letter of each word is a vowel. If it is, \"ay\" is appended to the end of the word; otherwise, the first two letters are moved to the end of the word and \"ay\" is added.\n\nPlease note that this code does not return anything but prints out the result directly, as printing strings in Julia can be done concurrently using `@async`. If you want to collect all results into a single string or array, you would have to modify this code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,430],"elapsed":3.554799427,"_type":"aimessage"}]
