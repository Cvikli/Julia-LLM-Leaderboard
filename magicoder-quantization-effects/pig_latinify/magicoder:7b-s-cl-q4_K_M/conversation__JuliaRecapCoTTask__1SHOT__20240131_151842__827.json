[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

We use `@distributed (vcat)` to run each iteration on a separate thread and then concatenate all results together using `vcat`. For each word, we check if it starts with a lowercase letter or an uppercase letter. If so, we add \"ay\" at the end. If the first character is a digit, we add \"a\" after the rest of the string. Otherwise, we add \"ay\" before the first letter and add \"ay\" at the end if the first letter was not lowercase. The result is printed out using `println.(pig_latinify(words))`.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that words are separated by spaces in the input vector. If they aren't, you may need to modify this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,378],"elapsed":3.103312751,"_type":"aimessage"}]
