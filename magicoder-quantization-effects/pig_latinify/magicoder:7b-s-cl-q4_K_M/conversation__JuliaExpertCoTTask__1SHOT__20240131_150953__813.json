It then creates a separate thread for each word in the input vector, translating it into Pig Latin and adding the result to the channel. After all threads have finished, it collects the results from the channel into an array and returns this array.\n\nThe `translate` function checks if the first letter of the word is a vowel; if so, it appends \"ay\" to the end of the word. If not, it moves the rest of the word and the first letter to the end and adds \"ay\". The translated words are then added to the channel using `@async`.\n\nFinally, the `pig_latinify` function collects the translated words from the channel into an array and returns this array.","status":200,"tokens":[0,461],"elapsed":3.718957444,"_type":"aimessage"}]
