[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you can solve the problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(input::Vector{String})\n    @async begin\n        for word in input\n            println(pig_latin(word))\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word::String)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    if first(word) âˆˆ vowels\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        return string(word[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn the above code, `pig_latinify` is a function that takes an array of strings as input. It uses `@async` macro to run each iteration on separate thread. Inside the loop, it calls `pig_latin` function for each word in the input vector and prints the result.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function checks if the first letter of the string is a vowel or not. If it's a vowel, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word. Otherwise, it moves the first character to the end of the word and appends \"ay\".\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that words are separated by spaces in your input strings. If your input is in another format (e.g., all on one line), you might need to modify the `pig_latin` function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,337],"elapsed":2.780474753,"_type":"aimessage"}]
