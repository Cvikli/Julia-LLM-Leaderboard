[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Here's an implementation of this problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    function convert_word(word::AbstractString)\n        # Pig Latin conversion rules:\n        # If a word begins with a vowel, add \"way\" to the end.\n        # Otherwise, move the initial consonant cluster to the end and add \"ay\".\n        vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n        if startswith(word, vowels)\n            word *= \"way\"\n        else\n            start_index = findfirst(x -> x in vowels, word)\n            push!(word, word[start_index:end]) *= \"ay\"\n            word = pop!(word, start_index)\n        end\n        return word\n    end\n\n    # Split the input string into a vector of words.\n    words = split(words, ' ')\n\n    # Convert each word to pig latin in separate threads and join them back together.\n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        words[i] = convert_word(lowercase(words[i]))\n    end\n    return join(words, ' ')\nend\n```\nThis `pig_latinify` function transforms a sentence into pig latin by moving the first consonant cluster of each word to the end and appending \"ay\". If the word starts with a vowel, it's just appended with \"way\" at the end. It operates on an entire string at once and does not require any specific elements within the string to be sorted or grouped in any way. \n\nThis function uses multithreading to convert each word independently, so that the conversion of one word does not block the conversion of another. \n\nPlease remember to include `using Threads` if you haven't already and run your code in a Julia environment.","status":200,"tokens":[0,463],"elapsed":3.747627882,"_type":"aimessage"}]
