The transformation is done by taking the first letter of the word, appending \"ay\", and placing it before the rest of the word.\n\nThe `@everywhere function transform_word(word::String)` line defines a function `transform_word` that will be run on all workers (in this case, just the current one). This function is used to convert each individual word into pig latin.\n\nFinally, it prints out the result of calling `pig_latinify` with the given vector of words.","status":200,"tokens":[0,314],"elapsed":2.516251735,"_type":"aimessage"}]
