Each word is transformed separately using the `pig_latin_word` function. The thread pool executor is used to run each operation in a separate thread.\n\nThe `pig_latin_word` function transforms a single word into Pig Latin. It simply takes the first letter of the word (if it has more than one letter), moves it to the end, and appends \"ay\" to form the new word.","status":200,"tokens":[0,337],"elapsed":2.727902964,"_type":"aimessage"}]
