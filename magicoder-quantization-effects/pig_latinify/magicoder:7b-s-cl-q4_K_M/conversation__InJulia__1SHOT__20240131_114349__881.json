It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed, Transduce\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    @sync begin\n        for string in strings\n            @async println(pig_latinify_single(string))\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_single(s::String)\n    words = split(s, ' ')\n    pig_latin_words = map(words) do word\n        if startswith(word, vowel)\n            word * \"ay\"\n        else\n            word[2:end] * \"-\" * word[1] * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n    join(pig_latin_words, ' ')\nend\n```\n\nThis function `pig_latinify` uses `@sync begin ... end` to create a new task for each string in the vector and then waits for all of them to finish. \n\nThe `pig_latinify_single` function splits the input string into words, checks if the first letter is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), and appends \"ay\" to it. If not, it moves the first letter to the end of the word and adds \"-\" followed by \"ay\". Finally, it joins all the words back together with spaces in between.\n\nPlease note that this is a very basic implementation and doesn't handle punctuation or capitalization correctly. It also assumes English vowels which may not be correct for other languages.","status":200,"tokens":[69,357],"elapsed":2.874607162,"_type":"aimessage"}]
