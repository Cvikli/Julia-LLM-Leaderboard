[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

This function uses `@spawn` to create a new thread for each string in the vector and stores these threads in a results array. Each thread calls the `pig_latin_word` function on its respective string, and then we use `fetch` to get the result from each thread.\n\nThe `pig_latin_word` function takes a string as input and checks if the first letter is lowercase or uppercase. If it's lowercase, it appends \"ay\" to the end of the word. If it's uppercase, it prepends \"Ay\" to the rest of the word (after converting the first letter to lowercase).","status":200,"tokens":[0,365],"elapsed":2.998569473,"_type":"aimessage"}]
