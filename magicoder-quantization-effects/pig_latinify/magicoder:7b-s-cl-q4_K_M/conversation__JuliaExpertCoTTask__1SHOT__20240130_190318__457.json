In order to make it work in multi-threaded way, we use `Threads.@threads` macro:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    function translate(word::String)\n        word = lowercase(first(word)) * join([ch for ch in word[2:end]] * \"ay\" , \"\")\n    end\n\n    return [Threads.@spawn(translate(word)) for word in words] |> collect\nend\n```\n\nThis function `pig_latinify` takes a vector of strings, translates each string to pig latin within its own thread using `Threads.@threads`, and returns a vector of translated strings. The helper function `translate` is used inside the `@spawn` macro to transform each word into pig latin in its own thread.\n\nHere's how you would use it with your example:\n\n```julia\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\n```","status":200,"tokens":[230,235],"elapsed":9.025772233,"_type":"aimessage"}]
