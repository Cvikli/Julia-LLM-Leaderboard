[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"This problem can be solved using the `Base.Threads.@threads` macro provided by Julia's standard library. It allows you to define a block of code that will be executed in parallel across multiple threads, which is perfect for tasks like this where each iteration has its own workload and no interdependencies between them.\n\nFirst, let's define the function `pig_latinify` that translates English words into Pig Latin:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(word::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    # Check if word starts with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u) and move the first letter to end followed by \"ay\"\n    for vowel in [\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"]\n        if startswith(word.lowercase(), vowel)\n            return word * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n    # If not, move the first letter to end and add \"ay\" at the end\n    return string(word[2:end]) * \"ay\" * word[1]\nend\n```\n\nThen, we can define a function that applies this operation on an entire list of strings using threading:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify_vector(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    results = Array{Any}(undef, length(words)) # Allocate space for the result vector\n    @threads for i in eachindex(words) \n        results[i] = pig_latinify(words[i]) # Apply the transformation to each word and store it into the results array\n    end\n    return results\nend\n```\n\nNote: The function `pig_latinify` will only work correctly on single words. For a complete translation of sentences (strings), we would need to implement a more complex rule set, which is beyond the scope of this problem.","status":200,"tokens":[0,427],"elapsed":3.467939277,"_type":"aimessage"}]
