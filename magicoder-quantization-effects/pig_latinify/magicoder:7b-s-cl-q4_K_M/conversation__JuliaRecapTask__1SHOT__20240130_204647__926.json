[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin.

Here is one possible solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\nfunction pig_latinify(str::AbstractString)\n    words = split(lowercase(str), ' ')\n    pig_words = [words[i][2:end]*\"ay\" for i in eachindex(words)]\n    return join(pig_words, \" \")\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_threaded(strings::AbstractVector{<:AbstractString})\n    threads = @distributed (ret=Any) for str in strings\n        pig_latinify(str)\n    end\n    return [t[1] for t in threads]\nend\n```\n\nThis function `pig_latinify` takes a string, splits it into words, and then appends \"ay\" to each word. \n\nThe `pig_latinify_threaded` function uses the `@distributed` macro provided by Julia's Distributed module to run this operation on each of the input strings in parallel across multiple threads. The result is a list of the transformed strings. \n\nKeep in mind, using multi-threading might not be beneficial for small computations or if your system doesn't have multiple cores. Also, always test with a smaller set of data to ensure that it works correctly before running on larger datasets.","status":200,"tokens":[0,326],"elapsed":2.635703385,"_type":"aimessage"}]
