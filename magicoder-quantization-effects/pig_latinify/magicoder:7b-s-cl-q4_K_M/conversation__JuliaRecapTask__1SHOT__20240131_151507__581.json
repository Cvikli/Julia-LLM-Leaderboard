[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin.

The `pig_latinify` function takes in an array of strings and uses `@async` and `@sync` to run the `pig_latinify_word` function on each string in a separate thread. \n\nThe `pig_latinify_word` function does most of the work, it takes in a single word and checks if its first letter is uppercase or lowercase. If it's lowercase, it appends \"ay\" to the end of the rest of the word and adds the first letter at the beginning. If it's uppercase, it does the same thing but also capitalizes the first letter of the new word. If neither condition is true, it assumes that the word starts with a vowel and simply appends \"ay\" to the end. \n\nPlease note: this code is just an example of how you could solve this problem in Julia, it may not be the most efficient or optimal solution for larger datasets.","status":200,"tokens":[369,433],"elapsed":3.642626471,"_type":"aimessage"}]
