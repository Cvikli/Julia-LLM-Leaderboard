X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an implementation in Julia using `Base.Threads` for multithreading and the Pig Latin rules for transforming English words into Pig Latin:\n\n1. The first vowel in a word is moved to the end and \"ay\" is added at the end of it. If the first letter is a consonant, move it to the end and add \"ay\".\n2. If a word has multiple vowels, only the first one is moved to the end and \"ay\" is added.\n3. Words with no vowel are changed to \"Owehay\" (a common convention for words like \"quack\", \"squeak\", etc.)\n4. Capitalized words in the original string should be converted to lowercase and have the first letter of each word capitalized.\n5. The function `pig_latinify` takes a vector of strings as input, converts it into a Vector of Char arrays (to split them by spaces for processing), splits them again into words in each thread, checks if they start with a vowel and modifies them accordingly.\n6. Use `Threads.@threads` to create multiple threads. Each thread operates on its own part of the vector of strings, converts it into an array of words, then uses the Pig Latin rules to convert these words into Pig Latin.\n7. The final result is a Vector of Strings that each represent a sentence in Pig Latin.\n8. If special instructions are provided, they should be used over default rules. However, if not provided, this function will follow standard Pig Latin rules. \n\nHere's an example implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\npig_latinify(words::Vector{String}) = begin\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    # Split string into vector of words\n    words = [collect.(split.(word, \" \"))... for word in words]\n    # Convert each sentence to pig latin and store it in a new Vector of Strings\n    pig_latin_sentences = Vector{String}()\n    @threads for word in words\n        vowel_found = false\n        for i in 1:length(word)\n            if word[i] in vowels\n                vowel_found = true\n                break\n            end\n        end\n        # If no vowel found, change to \"Owehay\" (Pig Latin equivalent of an English word without a vowel)\n        pig_latin_word = vowel_found ? \"$(join(word[2:end]))$(word[1])$(\"ay\")\" : \"owEhay\"\n        # If the first letter is uppercase in original sentence, capitalize first letter of each word in Pig Latin sentence\n        pig_latin_sentences = push!(pig_latin_sentences, map(string, join.(pig_latin_word)) do word\n            startswith(word, uppercase('a')) ? \"$(lowercase(word[1]))$(word[2:end])\" : word\n        end)\n    end\n    return pig_latin_sentences\nend\n```\nRemember to replace `$` with `@` and `\"` with `'` in the Pig Latin rules.","status":200,"tokens":[0,740],"elapsed":6.077676611,"_type":"aimessage"}]
