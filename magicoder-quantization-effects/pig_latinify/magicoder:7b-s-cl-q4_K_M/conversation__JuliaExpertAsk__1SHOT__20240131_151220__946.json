It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution using the `concurrent.futures` module for multithreading:\n\n```python\nimport concurrent.futures\n\ndef pig_latinify(words):\n    def convert_word(word):\n        if word[0] in 'aeiou':\n            return f'{word}way'\n        else:\n            return f'{word[1:]}{word[0]}ay'\n    \n    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:\n        return list(executor.map(convert_word, words))\n```\n\nThis function `pig_latinify` takes a list of strings (words) and for each string it checks if the first letter is a vowel or not. If it's a vowel then the word \"way\" is appended at the end else the first letter is moved to the end of the word followed by \"ay\".\n\nThis operation is performed on each string in a separate thread using `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`. The results are collected and returned as a list.\n\nNote: Pig Latin is a language game where you move the first letter(s) to the end of words, then add \"ay\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,271],"elapsed":2.151305166,"_type":"aimessage"}]
