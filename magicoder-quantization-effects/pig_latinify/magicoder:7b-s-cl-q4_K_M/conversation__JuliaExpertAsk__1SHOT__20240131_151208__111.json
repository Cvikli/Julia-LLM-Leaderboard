It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, we can use the `Threads.@threads` macro for running code in parallel across multiple threads. Here's how you could implement such function:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(strings))\n\n    @threads for i in eachindex(strings)\n        result[i] = pig_latinify_single(strings[i])\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_single(s::String)\n    words = split(s, ' ')  # Split string into words\n    for i in eachindex(words)\n        if startswith(words[i], vowels)\n            words[i] *= \"ay\"\n        else\n            words[i] = words[i][2:end]*\"ay\"*words[i][1]\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(words, ' ')  # Join the words back into a string\nend\n\nvowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n```\n\nIn this code, `pig_latinify` is the function that takes in a vector of strings and returns another vector with each string transformed to pig latin. It uses `@threads` macro for running the inner loop on separate threads.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_single` function is responsible for transforming a single string into pig latin. It splits the input string into words, checks if the first letter of each word is a vowel, and appends \"ay\" to it accordingly. If not, it moves the first character to the end and adds \"ay\". Finally, it joins all transformed words back together into a single string.\n\nThe `vowels` array holds all English vowels for checking if the first letter of a word is a vowel.","status":200,"tokens":[0,436],"elapsed":3.493718212,"_type":"aimessage"}]
