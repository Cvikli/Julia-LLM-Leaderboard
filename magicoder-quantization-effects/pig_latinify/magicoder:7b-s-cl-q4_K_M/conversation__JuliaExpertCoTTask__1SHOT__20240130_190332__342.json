For simplicity, we only consider English vowels as starting letters of words. We also assume spaces in the input string to separate words. The main function `pig_latinify` then applies this translation to each word in a sentence (or string), splitting sentences at spaces, and joining them back together with spaces between words. \n\nFinally, we run this process for every string in the provided vector of strings, ensuring it runs on separate threads due to `@threads`. \n\nNote: The Pig Latin transformation is quite simple but does not accurately reflect real English syntax and pronunciation rules. In real life scenarios, words beginning with certain consonant sounds are shifted to the end of the word and then followed by \"ay\". Words starting with vowels are simply added \"-\" and \"ay\" at the end.","status":200,"tokens":[0,469],"elapsed":3.905790938,"_type":"aimessage"}]
