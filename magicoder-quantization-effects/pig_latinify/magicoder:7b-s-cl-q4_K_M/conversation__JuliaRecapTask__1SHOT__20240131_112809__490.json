[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Inside the function, we use `@sync begin ... @async ... end` to ensure that all threads are synchronized at the end. \n\nWe then iterate over each word in the input vector and convert it to pig latin using the `pig_latin` function. This is done on a separate thread for each word with `@async`. The result of the conversion is printed out immediately, but could be stored or manipulated as needed. \n\nThe `pig_latin` function checks if the first letter of the input string is a vowel and appends \"way\" to it if so. If not, it removes the first character and appends \"ay\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,309],"elapsed":2.51094969,"_type":"aimessage"}]
