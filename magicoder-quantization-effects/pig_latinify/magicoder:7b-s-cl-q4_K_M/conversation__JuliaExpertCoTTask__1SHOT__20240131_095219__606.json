The `@sync begin ... @spawn ... end` construct is used to run the tasks in parallel using multiple threads. \n\nThe `pig_latin` function translates a single word into pig latin. It checks if the first letter of the word is a vowel, and if so, appends \"way\" to it. Otherwise, it moves all letters after the first one to the end and adds the first letter followed by \"ay\".\n\nYou can test this function with your example like:\n```julia\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,323],"elapsed":3.853069508,"_type":"aimessage"}]
