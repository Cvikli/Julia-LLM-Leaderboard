It uses the `@sync begin ... end` macro to create a synchronization context for running tasks in parallel using threads. For each word in the input list, it creates an asynchronous task (`@async`) that calls the inner function `pig_latinify(word)` and prints its output.\n\nThe inner function `pig_latinify(word::String)` translates a single word into pig latin. It checks if the first letter of the word is a vowel, in which case it appends \"way\" to the end of the word before adding \"ay\". If the first letter is not a vowel, it simply adds \"ay\" at the end of the word.\n\nYou can test this function with your example:\n```julia\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,363],"elapsed":4.553854961,"_type":"aimessage"}]
