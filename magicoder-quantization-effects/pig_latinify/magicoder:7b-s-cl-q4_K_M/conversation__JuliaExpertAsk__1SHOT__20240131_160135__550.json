The `Transduce.transduce` function applies the given transducer (which just reverses each word) to each element in an iterable.\n\nThe `Distributed.pmap` function is used to apply the `pig_latinify` function to each string in the input vector in parallel. The result is a vector of transformed strings.\n\nFinally, we print out each transformed string along with its index.","status":200,"tokens":[142,377],"elapsed":11.609368921,"_type":"aimessage"}]
