It then iterates over each string, and for each string, it separates the words using space as delimiter, and applies a mapping function to each word. \n\nInside this mapping function, it checks if the first character of the word is uppercase or lowercase, appends \"ay\" accordingly, otherwise treats the word as having any other case (like punctuation) and also append \"ay\". After that, it concatenates all the transformed words back into a string.\n\nThe `@distributed` macro tells Julia to execute this function in parallel on multiple threads. The `vcat` operation at the end is used to concatenate the results of each thread into one single vector.\n\nRemember, for this code to work you need to have 2 or more processors available (you can check it using `length(procs())`). If not, you should add them by calling `addprocs(n)` where `n` is the number of additional processes you want to add.","status":200,"tokens":[0,607],"elapsed":4.924792429,"_type":"aimessage"}]
