It then creates a channel to pass the transformed strings between threads. For each string, it starts a new thread that calls the `pig_latinify_single` function and puts the result into the channel. After all threads have finished, it collects all the results from the channel into an array and returns it.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_single` function splits each string into words, transforms each word to pig latin (using the `pig_latin` function), and then joins the transformed words back together.\n\nFinally, the `pig_latin` function is a helper function that implements the rules for transforming English words to Pig Latin. It checks if the first letter of the word is lowercase or uppercase and applies the appropriate transformation rule.","status":200,"tokens":[0,513],"elapsed":4.138530982,"_type":"aimessage"}]
