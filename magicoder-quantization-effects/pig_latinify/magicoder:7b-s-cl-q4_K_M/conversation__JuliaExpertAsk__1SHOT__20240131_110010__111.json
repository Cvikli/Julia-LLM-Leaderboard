It uses `@sync begin ... @async ... end` to run each iteration on a separate thread. The inner function `pig_latinify(s::String)` is used to transform each string into pig latin.\n\nThe code checks if the first letter of each word is a vowel, and if not, it moves the first letter to the end of the word and appends \"-ay\". It then returns the transformed string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,328],"elapsed":2.616009767,"_type":"aimessage"}]
