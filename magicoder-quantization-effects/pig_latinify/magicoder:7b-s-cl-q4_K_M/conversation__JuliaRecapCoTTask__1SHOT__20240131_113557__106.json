[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example solution for the task:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String}, threads = nthreads())\n    @sync begin\n        for word in words\n            @async println(pig_latinify_word(word))\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_word(word)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    if first_letter in vowels\n        return \"$wordway\"\n    else\n        return \"$(word[2:end])ay\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis solution uses the `@sync` macro to ensure that all threads are joined before the function returns. The `@async` macro is used to create a new task for each word in the vector, and the `println` function is used to print out the result of the pig latin transformation. \n\nThe `pig_latinify_word` function takes a single word as input and transforms it into pig latin. If the first letter of the word is a vowel, it adds \"way\" at the end of the word. Otherwise, it moves all letters after the first one to the end of the word and adds \"ay\".\n\nThis solution assumes that you have Julia installed on your machine and that you're familiar with multi-threading in Julia using `@async` and `@sync`.
