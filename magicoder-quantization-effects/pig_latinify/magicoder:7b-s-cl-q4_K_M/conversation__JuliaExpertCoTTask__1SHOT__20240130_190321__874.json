It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is an example of how this could be implemented in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String}) \n    @distributed (vcat) for word in words\n        split(word, \" \") |> join([move_to_pig_latin(w) for w in collect(eachword(word))])\n    end\nend\n\nfunction move_to_pig_latin(word::String)\n    if first(word) isupper\n        word = lowercase(word) * \"ay\"\n    else \n        word = word[2:end] * \"-\" * uppercase(word[1]) * \"ay\"\n    end\n    return word\nend\n```\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function uses the `@distributed (vcat)` macro to apply a for loop over the words in the input vector concurrently. Each word is then split into individual letters, each of which undergoes the `move_to_pig_latin` transformation, and are joined back together to form the pig Latin version of the original word. The transformed words are collected together in a Vector that gets returned by the function.\n\nThis code will convert the string into Pig Latin format - moving first letter to the end of the word with \"ay\" suffix and capitalizing first letter of remaining word. Also, it maintains uppercase for the first letter if input was in uppercase. It does not handle punctuation or special characters as they are not included in Pig Latin rules. \n\nYou can use `addprocs(1)` to add a worker process before using `@distributed` to parallelize over a single-threaded process and then `rmprocs()` to remove the added worker.","status":200,"tokens":[0,397],"elapsed":3.255673915,"_type":"aimessage"}]
