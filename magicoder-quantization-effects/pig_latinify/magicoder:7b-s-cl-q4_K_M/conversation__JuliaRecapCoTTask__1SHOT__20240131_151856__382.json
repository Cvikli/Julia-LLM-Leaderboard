[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `@sync begin ... end` syntax is used to ensure that all threads are joined before returning from `pig_latinify`.\n\nThe function `pig_latinify_single_string` splits the input string into individual words, and applies the `pig_latin_converter` function to each word. This converter function converts a single word to pig latin by moving the first letter(s) to the end of the word and appending \"-ay\" or \"-AY\".\n\nPlease note that this is a very basic implementation for demonstration purposes, in real-world applications you would want to handle edge cases (like punctuation), and possibly use `Threads.@spawn` instead of `@async` if you're not using the latest Julia version.","status":200,"tokens":[0,493],"elapsed":4.066442568,"_type":"aimessage"}]
