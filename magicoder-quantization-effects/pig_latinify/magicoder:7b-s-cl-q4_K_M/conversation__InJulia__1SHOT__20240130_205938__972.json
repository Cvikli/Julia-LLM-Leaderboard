Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example code snippet for how you can accomplish this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nimport Base.Threads.@threads\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    @threads for word in words\n        # Convert the first two letters of each word to uppercase\n        word = word[1:2] * uppercase(word[3:end])\n        \n        # Add \"ay\" at the end\n        word = word * \"ay\"\n        \n        println(word)  # print out the transformed word\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function `pig_latinify` uses the `@threads` macro from Julia's Base.Threads module to allow each iteration of the loop to run on a separate thread. It iterates over the input vector and applies the transformation, printing out each transformed word as it goes. \n\nPlease note that in this code snippet `uppercase(word[3:end])` is used to capitalize only the first letter after the first two letters of the original word. If you want to capitalize all letters (considering them as individual characters), replace it with `map(uppercase, word[4:end])`.\n\nYou can call this function like this:\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\"]\npig_latinify(words)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,302],"elapsed":2.348425357,"_type":"aimessage"}]
