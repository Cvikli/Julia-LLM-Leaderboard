Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem in Julia using the Threads package for multithreading:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    # Create an empty vector to store the transformed words\n    transformed_words = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    \n    @threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        word = words[i]\n        \n        # Split the word into a list of words\n        split_word = split(word)\n        \n        # Transform each word to pig latin and join them back together\n        transformed_words[i] = join([pig_latin_transform(w) for w in split_word], \" \")\n    end\n    \n    return transformed_words\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_transform(word::String)\n    # Pig Latin rules:\n    # 1. If a word starts with a vowel, add 'way' to the end of it.\n    # 2. Otherwise, move the first letter to the end and add 'ay'.\n    \n    if startswith(word, ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'])\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        return word[end-1:end] * word[1:end-1] * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, `pig_latinify` function creates an empty vector to store the transformed words. It then uses `@threads` macro to create a new thread for each iteration of the loop. Each thread transforms one word from the input vector into pig latin and stores it in the corresponding position in the output vector.\n\nThe `pig_latin_transform` function applies the Pig Latin rules: if a word starts with a vowel, it adds 'way' to the end of the word; otherwise, it moves the first letter to the end and adds 'ay'.","status":200,"tokens":[0,446],"elapsed":3.560307389,"_type":"aimessage"}]
