If adding a new word to the current line would exceed `text_width`, it starts a new line. It also adds a space before each word except for the first one in a line.\n\nHere is an example of how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\", 10))\n```\n\nThe output would be:\n\n```\nThis function\nwill wrap\nwords into\nlines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,244],"elapsed":4.293264435,"_type":"aimessage"}]
