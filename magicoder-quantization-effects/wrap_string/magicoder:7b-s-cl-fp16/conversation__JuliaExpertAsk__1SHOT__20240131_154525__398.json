Provide an example","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia code for your problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(s, ' ')\n    result = \"\"\n    line = \"\"\n    for word in words\n        if length(line * \" $word\") > text_width\n            result *= \"$line\\n\"\n            line = \"\"\n        end\n        line *= \" $word\"\n    end\n    return result * line\nend\n```\n\nThis function splits the input string into words and then checks if adding a new word to the current line would exceed the maximum text width. If it does, it starts a new line. It then adds the word to the current line and repeats this process until all words have been added. The resulting wrapped lines are concatenated with newline characters between them to form the final string.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This is a test sentence of various length.\", 10))\n```\n\nThe output would be:\n\n```\nThis is a \ntest sentence \nof various \nlength.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,260],"elapsed":4.486688901,"_type":"aimessage"}]
