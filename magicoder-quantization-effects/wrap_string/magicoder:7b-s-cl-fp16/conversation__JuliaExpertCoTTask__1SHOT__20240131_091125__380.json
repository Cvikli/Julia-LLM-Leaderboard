If adding a new word to the current line would exceed `text_width`, it starts a new line with that word. Otherwise, it adds the word to the current line. The result is a multi-line string where each line does not exceed `text_width`.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,232],"elapsed":4.101973659,"_type":"aimessage"}]
