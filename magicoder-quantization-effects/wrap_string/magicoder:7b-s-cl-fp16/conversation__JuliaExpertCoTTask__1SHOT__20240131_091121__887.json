For each word, it checks if adding this word to the current line would exceed the maximum text width. If it does, it appends the current line to the output string and starts a new line with just the current word. It then continues on with the next word. After all words have been processed, it appends the last line to the output string.\n\nHere is an example usage of this function:\n\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\n\nThis would print:\n\n```\nThis function \nwill wrap words \ninto lines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,275],"elapsed":4.915854992,"_type":"aimessage"}]
