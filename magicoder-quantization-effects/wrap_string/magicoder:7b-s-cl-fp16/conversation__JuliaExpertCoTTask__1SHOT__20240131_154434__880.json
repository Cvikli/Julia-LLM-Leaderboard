It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia code that fulfills your task:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text, \" \") # Split the string into words\n    result = \"\" \n    for word in words\n        if length(word) > text_width\n            return \"The maximum width is too small to fit a single word: $word\"\n        end\n        if length(result) + length(word) >= text_width\n            result *= \"\\n\" # Add a new line \n        elseif !isempty(result)\n            result *= \" \" # Add a space\n        end\n        result *= word # Append the word to the result\n    end\n    return result\nend\n\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\", 20))\n```\n\nIn this code, `split` is used to split the input string into an array of words. Then, for each word in the array, it checks whether adding that word to the current line would exceed the maximum width. If it would, a new line is added and the word is added to the new line. If not, a space is added instead of a newline.\n\nIf you run this code with `text_width` set to 20, `\"This function will wrap words into lines\"` should be printed in three lines: \"This function\", \"will wrap words\" and \"into lines\". The word \"function\" would exceed the maximum width if `text_width` was less than 13.","status":200,"tokens":[0,347],"elapsed":6.014285508,"_type":"aimessage"}]
