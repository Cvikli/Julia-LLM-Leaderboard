If so, it appends the current line to the result and starts a new one. At the end of the loop, it appends the remaining line to the result.\n\nThe test with provided example will print:\n```\nThis function \nwill wrap words \ninto lines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,235],"elapsed":4.067494755,"_type":"aimessage"}]
