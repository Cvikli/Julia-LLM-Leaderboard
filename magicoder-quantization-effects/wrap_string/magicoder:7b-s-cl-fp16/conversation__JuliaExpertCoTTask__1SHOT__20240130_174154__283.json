It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(s, \" \")  # Split the string into words\n    wrapped_words = []\n    current_line = \"\"\n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line * \" \" * word) <= text_width\n            push!(wrapped_words, current_line * \" \" * word)\n            current_line = \"\"\n        else\n            push!(wrapped_words, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        end\n    end\n    return join(wrapped_words, \"\\n\")  # Join the lines with newline character\nend\n```\n\nThe `wrap_string` function splits the string into words and iterates over each word. If a line plus the length of the next word would exceed the text width, it adds the current line to the list of wrapped words and starts a new line. It repeats this process until all words have been processed. At the end, it joins the lines with newline characters to create the final string. \n\nThe example provided wraps the words in the string into lines of maximum length 10:\n\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\n\nPlease note that the `split` method splits a string into substrings based on spaces. So, it doesn't include punctuation attached to words in the split result. If you want to keep these attached as separate words, you might need a more complex method for splitting the string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,353],"elapsed":6.199991013,"_type":"aimessage"}]
