The function splits the input string into individual words using the `split` function. Then it iterates over these words, adding each word to a line. If adding a new word would cause the line length to exceed `text_width`, it appends the current line to the result and starts a new line. Finally, it returns the resulting string.\n\nThe example provided wraps the input string \"This function will wrap words into lines\" at a maximum width of 15 characters per line.","status":200,"tokens":[0,267],"elapsed":4.782344276,"_type":"aimessage"}]
