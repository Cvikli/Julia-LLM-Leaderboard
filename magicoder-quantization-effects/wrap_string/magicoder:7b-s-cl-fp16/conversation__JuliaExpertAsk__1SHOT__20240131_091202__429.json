Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(s))\n```\n\nIn this example, the string is broken up into words and each word is added to a line until that line exceeds 10 characters in length. When it does, a new line is started with the current word. The function then continues adding words to lines until all words have been processed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,266],"elapsed":4.701798413,"_type":"aimessage"}]
