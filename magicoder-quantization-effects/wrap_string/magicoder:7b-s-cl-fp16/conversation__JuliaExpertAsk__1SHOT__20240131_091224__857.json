It checks if adding the next word to the current line would exceed the `text_width`. If it does, it adds the current line to the final result and starts a new one. At the end of all iterations, it adds the last line to the result.\n\nAn example usage:\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit\", 15))\n```\nThis will print:\n```\nLorem ipsum\ndolor sit\namet,\nconsectetur\nadipiscing\nelit\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,276],"elapsed":4.864374907,"_type":"aimessage"}]
