It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function that meets the task requirements:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s, text_width::Int=10) \n    words = split(s, \" \")  \n    result = String[]\n    line = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        if length(line * \" \" * word) > text_width\n            push!(result, line)\n            line = word\n        else\n            line = line * \" \" * word\n        end\n    end \n    push!(result, line)\n    return join(result, \"\\n\")\nend \n```\nYou can call the function like this:\n\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\", text_width=10))\n```\n\nThis code works by splitting the input string into words, then checking each word to see if it would cause the line length to exceed `text_width` when added. If it does, we append the current line to our result array and start a new line with just that word. If it won't, we add the word to the current line. After processing all words, we always add the remaining line to our results array before returning. The join operation at the end is used to convert the Array of strings into one string where each line is separated by a newline character.","status":200,"tokens":[0,295],"elapsed":5.143819033,"_type":"aimessage"}]
