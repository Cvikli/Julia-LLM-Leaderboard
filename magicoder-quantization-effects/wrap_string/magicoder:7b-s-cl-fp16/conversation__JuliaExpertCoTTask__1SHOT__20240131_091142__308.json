For each word, it checks if adding this word to the current line would exceed `text_width`. If so, it appends the current line to the result and starts a new line with just this word. Otherwise, it adds this word to the current line. After processing all words, it appends the last line to the result.\n\nHere is an example usage:\n\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nThis function \nwill wrap \nwords into \nlines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,265],"elapsed":4.679321447,"_type":"aimessage"}]
