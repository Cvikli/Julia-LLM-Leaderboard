For each word, it checks if adding that word to the current line (plus a space) would exceed `text_width`. If so, it appends the current line to the final result and starts a new line with just the current word. After going through all the words, it appends any remaining text on the current line to the final result.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipiscing elit\"))\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nLorem ipsum\ndolor sit amet\nconsectetur\nadipiscing elit\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,289],"elapsed":5.078941019,"_type":"aimessage"}]
