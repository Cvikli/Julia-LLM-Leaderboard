Then a loop goes through each word and checks if adding it would cause line width exceedance. If yes, it adds a new line (`\\n`). The newly added line or not, it adds the word to result. The function then returns the joined list of words separated by spaces.","status":200,"tokens":[0,244],"elapsed":4.252768074,"_type":"aimessage"}]
