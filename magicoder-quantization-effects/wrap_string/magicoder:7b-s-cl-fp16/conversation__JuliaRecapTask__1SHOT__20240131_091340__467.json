[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

For each word, it checks if adding this word to the current line would exceed `text_width`. If so, it appends the current line to the result (with a newline character at the beginning), and starts a new line. It then adds the word to the current line. At the end of the iteration, it appends the remaining line to the result if there is any.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This is a test string that needs to be wrapped\", 15))\n```\nIt will print:\n```\nThis is a test\nstring that needs\nto be wrapped\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,291],"elapsed":5.148062268,"_type":"aimessage"}]
