We then split this string into individual words using the `split` function. \n\nWe then loop through each word in our list of words. If adding the length of the current word would cause the line to exceed the maximum allowed length, we add a newline character to our result and reset the line length. If it's not the first word being added to the result, we also add a space between the previous word and the current one.\n\nFinally, we add the current word to our result string and increment the line length by its length. \n\nThe `println` at the end is used to print out the wrapped string to the console.","status":200,"tokens":[0,335],"elapsed":5.811019429,"_type":"aimessage"}]
