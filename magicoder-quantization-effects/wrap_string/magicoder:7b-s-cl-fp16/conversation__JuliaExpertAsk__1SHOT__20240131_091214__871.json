For each word, it checks if adding this word to the current line would exceed the maximum width. If so, it appends the current line to the result and starts a new line. Then it adds the word to the current line. After all words have been processed, it appends the final line to the result.\n\nHere is an example usage:\n\n```julia\ns = \"This is a test string that will be wrapped.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(s))\n```\n\nThe output of this code would look like this:\n\n```\nThis is \na test \nstring that \nwill be \nwrapped.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,279],"elapsed":4.90835587,"_type":"aimessage"}]
