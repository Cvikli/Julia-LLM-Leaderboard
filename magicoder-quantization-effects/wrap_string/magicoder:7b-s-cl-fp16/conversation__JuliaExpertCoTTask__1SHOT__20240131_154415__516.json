It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia code to solve the problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(str::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(str) # Split string into an array of words\n    result = \"\"       # Initialize output string\n\n    for word in words  # Iterate over each word\n        if length(result) + length(word) > text_width # Check if adding current word exceeds max width\n            result *= \"\\n\"                         # If so, add a new line\n        end\n        result *= \" $word\"    # Add the word to output string\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nYou can test this function with your example:\n\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\n\nIn this code, `split` function is used to split the input string into an array of words. Then we iterate over each word in the array. If adding current word to result would exceed maximum line width (`length(result) + length(word) > text_width`), a new line is added (`result *= \"\\n\"`). The word and a space are then added to the output string.\n\nPlease note that the function `wrap_string` does not handle punctuation attached to words correctly, especially if they are attached at the end of a sentence. Also, it adds extra space before each word in a new line. If you want to solve these issues, you can use `split(str, \" \")` instead of `split(str)`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,345],"elapsed":5.992114627,"_type":"aimessage"}]
