For every word, we check whether adding this word to our current line would exceed `text_width`. If it would, we add the current line to our list of lines (joined by newline character) and reset our line variable to just this word. \n- After iterating over all words, we add any remaining text in line to our list of lines and return the joined version of these lines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,275],"elapsed":4.812202709,"_type":"aimessage"}]
