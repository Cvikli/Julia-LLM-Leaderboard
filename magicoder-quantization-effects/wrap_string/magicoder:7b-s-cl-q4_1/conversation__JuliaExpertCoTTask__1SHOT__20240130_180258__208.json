If so, it appends a newline character. It then adds the word to the result string along with a space, and finally returns the result after removing any trailing whitespace using the chop function.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\nprint(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,214],"elapsed":1.750378944,"_type":"aimessage"}]
