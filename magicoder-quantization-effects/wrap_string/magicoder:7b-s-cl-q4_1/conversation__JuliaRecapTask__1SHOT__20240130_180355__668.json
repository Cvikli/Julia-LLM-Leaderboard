[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

It splits the input string into words using the `split` function. Then it iterates over these words. For each word, it checks whether adding this word to the current line would exceed `text_width`. If not, it adds the word to the current line (with a space in front). If it would exceed `text_width`, it appends a newline character and the word to the result string and starts a new line. Finally, if there's any leftover text on the last line, it adds another newline character before this leftover text. \n\nHere is an example usage:\n```julia\nprint(wrap_string(\"This is some test text that we are using to demonstrate wrapping\", text_width = 15))\n```\nThis will print:\n```\nThis is some test\ntext that we are\nusing to demonstrate\nwrapping\n```","status":200,"tokens":[364,360],"elapsed":3.015032822,"_type":"aimessage"}]
