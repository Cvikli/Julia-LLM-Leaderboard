I hope everything is going well for you.\"))\n```\nIn this code, `split(s)` function splits the string into words. The loop iterates over each word and checks if adding the current word to the existing line would cause it to exceed the maximum width. If so, a new line is started. Finally, all lines are concatenated together with `\\n` for new lines at the end of each one.","status":200,"tokens":[64,239],"elapsed":1.921956147,"_type":"aimessage"}]
