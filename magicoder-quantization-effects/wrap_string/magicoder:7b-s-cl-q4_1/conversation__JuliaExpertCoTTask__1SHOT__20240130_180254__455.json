The default value of `text_width` is 10.\n\nWe split the input string into words with `split(text, ' ')`, then iterate over them with `for word in words`. For each word, we check if adding it to the current line would exceed the maximum width by using `length(line * \" \" * word) > text_width`. If so, we add a newline character to the result (`result *= \"\\n\" * line`), then start a new line with just this word. Otherwise, we add this word to the end of the current line and continue.\n\nIn the end, we ensure that any remaining words after the loop are added to the output string (if the last line was not full), adding another newline character at the end (`result *= \"\\n\" * line`). The resulting function will wrap a given piece of text into lines with a maximum width specified by `text_width`.\n\nAs an example, if you run `wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")`, it should output:\n```julia\n\"This function\\nwill wrap words\\ninto lines\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,406],"elapsed":3.305298569,"_type":"aimessage"}]
