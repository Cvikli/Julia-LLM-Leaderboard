This is only a test.\", 15))\n```\nWhen you run this program, it will print:\n```shell\nThis is a test.\nThis is only a test.\n```\nNote that the function `split` splits string into words by spaces, and then iterates over each word. For each word, if adding it to the line would exceed the maximum width, we start a new line and add the word. If not, we just add the word to the current line. \nThe \"\\n\" is used as newline character.","status":200,"tokens":[0,265],"elapsed":2.124517588,"_type":"aimessage"}]
