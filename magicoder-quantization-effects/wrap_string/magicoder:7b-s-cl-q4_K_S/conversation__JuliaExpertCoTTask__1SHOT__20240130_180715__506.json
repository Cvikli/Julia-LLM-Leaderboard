It then iterates over each word in the given text, checking whether adding the next word would exceed half the width specified by `text_width`. If so, it prints out the current line and starts a new one with the next word. Otherwise, it just adds the next word to the current line. After going through all the words, it returns the final line of text.\n\nExample:\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\", 20))\n```\nOutput:\n```julia\n\"This function will\"\n\"wrap words into\"\n\"lines\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,292],"elapsed":2.269278364,"_type":"aimessage"}]
