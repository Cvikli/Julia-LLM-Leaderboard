The resulting array of lines is then joined back together with newline characters to form the final output string. \n\nIf you call this function with your example, it will return:\n\n```julia\n@assert wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\") == \"This function\\nwill wrap words\\ninto lines\"\n```\n\nThis should pass without an error as the output string matches exactly with the expected result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,256],"elapsed":1.992400332,"_type":"aimessage"}]
