Then we iterate over these words, checking each one whether it would make the current line exceed the specified width or not. If it does, we add a new line to our result and start a new one with the current word; if not, we just append the current word to the current line. At the end of the function, we add the remaining line to our result (if any) and return it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,263],"elapsed":2.11006576,"_type":"aimessage"}]
