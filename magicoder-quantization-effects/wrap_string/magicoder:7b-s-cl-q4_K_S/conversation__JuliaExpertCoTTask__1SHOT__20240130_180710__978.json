If it does, it adds a new line. It then appends the word to the result string, checking that doing so wouldn't cause the current line length to exceed `text_width`. \n\nHere is an example of using this function:\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\", 10))\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it should output the string `\"This\\nfunction\\nwill\\nwrap\\nwords\\ninto\\nlines\"`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,314],"elapsed":2.450958418,"_type":"aimessage"}]
