For each word, it checks if adding the length of this word to the current length of `result` would exceed `text_width`. If so, a new line and space are written before appending the word. Otherwise, the word is simply appended with a space.\n\nYou can test this function using your example:\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\", 10))\n```\nIt should print:\n```julia\n\"This function\nwill wrap words\ninto lines\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[218,262],"elapsed":12.160026593,"_type":"aimessage"}]
