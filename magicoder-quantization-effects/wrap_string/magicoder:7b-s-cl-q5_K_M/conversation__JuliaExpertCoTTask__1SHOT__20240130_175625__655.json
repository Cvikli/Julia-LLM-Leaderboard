If it does, a new line is started with `line = \"\"` and the old line is added to `result` before adding the current word. If not, then just the space and the current word are concatenated to `line`.\nAt last, after finishing looping through all words, `line` is added to `result` (as a new line will not be started) and the final string is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,247],"elapsed":2.159554592,"_type":"aimessage"}]
