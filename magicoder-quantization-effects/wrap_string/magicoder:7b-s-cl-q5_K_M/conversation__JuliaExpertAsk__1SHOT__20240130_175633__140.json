It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is a simple implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(s, \" \")\n    result = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(result) + length(word) > text_width\n            result *= \"\\n\"\n        end\n        \n        result *= \"$word \"\n    end\n    \n    return chop(result) # chop trailing whitespace\nend\n```\nThe `wrap_string` function works by splitting the input string into an array of words. Then it iterates over each word in the list and checks if adding the current word to the result would exceed the specified text width. If so, it adds a new line before adding the word. Finally, the trailing space is removed with `chop`. \n\nTo test the function, you can use:\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This is a simple sentence\", 10))\n```\nIt should output:\n```julia\n\"This is a \\nsimple \\nsentence\"\n```\nIn this example, \"simple\" and \"sentence\" are wrapped to the next line because their combined length exceeds the specified text width of 10.","status":200,"tokens":[0,284],"elapsed":2.491916509,"_type":"aimessage"}]
