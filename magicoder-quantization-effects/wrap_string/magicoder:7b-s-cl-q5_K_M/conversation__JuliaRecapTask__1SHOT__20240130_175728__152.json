[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded.

Integer aliquam orci non neque scelerisque, in commodo erat accumsan.\"\nprint(wrap_string(str))\n```\n\nThis function splits the input string into words and checks for each word whether adding it to the current line will exceed the specified width. If this happens, it adds the current line to the result and starts a new one. It then repeats this process until all words have been processed. The final line is also added without a newline character at the end because it represents the last line of the string that may not be completed by adding another word.\n\nPlease note that in order for the function to work as expected, you should ensure that each word is separated by a space and there are no extra spaces at the beginning or end of your input string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,325],"elapsed":2.900137574,"_type":"aimessage"}]
