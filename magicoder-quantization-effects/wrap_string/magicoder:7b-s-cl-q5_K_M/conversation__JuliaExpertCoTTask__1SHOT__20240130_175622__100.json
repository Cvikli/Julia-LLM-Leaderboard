It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is your requested function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(str::String, text_width=10)\n    words = split(str, ' ')\n    result = \"\"\n    for word in words\n        if length(result) + length(word) > text_width\n            result *= \"\\n\"\n        end\n        result *= \" $word\"\n    end\n    return strip(result)  # remove leading space at the beginning of the string.\nend\n```\nHere's how you would call this function with your provided example:\n\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\nIn the code above, `split` is used to split the input string into an array of words. The `for` loop iterates over each word in the input string, checking if adding the length of the current word plus a space would exceed `text_width`. If it would, a newline character (`\\n`) is added to `result`. Then the word and a space are appended to `result`, with the leading space removed using `strip`. The function then returns this result.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that your input string does not include any other whitespace characters (like tabs) or special characters like punctuation.","status":200,"tokens":[0,288],"elapsed":2.540194193,"_type":"aimessage"}]
