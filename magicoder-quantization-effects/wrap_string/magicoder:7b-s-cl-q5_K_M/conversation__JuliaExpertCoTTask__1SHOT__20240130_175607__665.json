It splits the input string into words using split() function. Then, it iterates over each word in the list and if adding the current word to the existing line would exceed the maximum allowed length, the current line is added to the output string with a newline character and the new word becomes the start of the new line. If adding the current word to the current line wouldn't exceed the text width, it simply appends the word to the end of the current line. At the end of the function, the remaining part of the last line is added to the output string with a newline character.\n\nExample: `wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")` would return `\"This\\nfunction\\nwill\\nwrap\\nwords\\ninto\\nlines\"`","status":200,"tokens":[0,326],"elapsed":2.879244405,"_type":"aimessage"}]
