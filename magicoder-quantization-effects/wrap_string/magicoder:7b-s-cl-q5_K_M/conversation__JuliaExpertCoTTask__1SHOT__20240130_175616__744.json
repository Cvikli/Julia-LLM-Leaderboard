If adding the current word (plus a trailing space if it's not the first word in a line) wouldn't exceed the maximum width, it adds that word to the current line and moves on to the next word. \n- If the current line plus this new word would exceed the maximum width, it prints out the current line, starts a new one with just the current word, then continues to the next word. \n- After all words have been processed, it prints out any remaining line.\n\nWhen we run `wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\", 10)` with an example text and maximum width of 10 characters per line, this code will print:\n```bash\nThis function\nwill wrap\nwords\ninto\nlines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,333],"elapsed":2.919987595,"_type":"aimessage"}]
