Then a loop iterates over each word in the array of words. If concatenating the current line with the current word would exceed the maximum text width, we print the current line and reset it. Then we append the current word to the line. After all words have been processed, we print the last line.\n\nWhen run with your example input, this function will output:\n```\nThis function \nwill wrap \nwords into \nlines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,252],"elapsed":2.194810434,"_type":"aimessage"}]
