[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

Then it iterates over each word and for each word, if adding the length of that word to the current line would exceed the maximum width, it appends the current line (with newline) to the output and starts a new line with this word. If adding the word wouldn't cause any issues, just adds the word to the current line. At the end, after going through all words, it appends the remaining current line (without newline) to the output.\n\nHere is an example usage:\n\n```julia\nstr = \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit\"\nprintln(wrap_string(str))\n```\n\nThe output will be:\n\n```\nLorem ipsum \ndolor sit amet \nconsectetur adipisicing \nelit\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,321],"elapsed":2.850843542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
