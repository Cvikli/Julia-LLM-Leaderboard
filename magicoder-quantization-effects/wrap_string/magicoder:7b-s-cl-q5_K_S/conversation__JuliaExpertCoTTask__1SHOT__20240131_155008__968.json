If adding the current word to the current line would exceed `text_width`, it starts a new line. The function returns the wrapped string.\n\nYou can test this function with your example:\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\n\nThe output should be:\n```\nThis function \nwill wrap words \ninto lines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,258],"elapsed":2.185353199,"_type":"aimessage"}]
