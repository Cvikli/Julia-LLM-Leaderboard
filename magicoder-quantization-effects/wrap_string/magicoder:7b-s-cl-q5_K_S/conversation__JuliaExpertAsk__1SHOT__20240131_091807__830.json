Provide an example","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia code for your problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::String, text_width::Int = 10)\n    words = split(s, \" \")\n    result = \"\"\n    line = \"\"\n    for word in words\n        if length(line * \" $word\") > text_width\n            result *= \"$line\\n\"\n            line = \"\"\n        end\n        line *= \" $word\"\n    end\n    result *= \"$line\"\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the input string into words and then iterating over each word. If adding a new word to the current line would exceed `text_width`, it starts a new line. The resulting lines are joined back together with newline characters between them.\n\nHere is an example usage:\n\n```julia\ns = \"This is a test string for wrapping text.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(s, 15))\n```\n\nThe output will be:\n\n```\nThis is a test\nstring for\nwrapping text.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,246],"elapsed":2.126055747,"_type":"aimessage"}]
