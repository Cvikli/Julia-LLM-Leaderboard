[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

It checks if adding a new word to the current line would exceed the `text_width`. If it does, it appends the current line to the result and starts a new line with the current word. Otherwise, it adds the current word to the current line. After processing all words, it appends the last line to the result.\n\nHere is an example usage:\n\n```julia\ns = \"This is a test string for wrapping text.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(s))\n```\n\nIn this case, each word in the string will be printed on a new line if adding it would exceed `text_width=10`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,287],"elapsed":2.501077369,"_type":"aimessage"}]
