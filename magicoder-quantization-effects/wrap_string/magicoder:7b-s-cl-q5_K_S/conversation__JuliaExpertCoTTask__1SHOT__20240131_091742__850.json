It checks if adding a new word to the current line would exceed `text_width`. If it does, it appends the current line to the result and starts a new line. At the end of the loop, it adds the last line to the result.\n\nHere is an example usage:\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\", 10))\n```\nThe output would be:\n```\nThis function\nwill wrap\nwords into\nlines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[218,257],"elapsed":7.65754047,"_type":"aimessage"}]
