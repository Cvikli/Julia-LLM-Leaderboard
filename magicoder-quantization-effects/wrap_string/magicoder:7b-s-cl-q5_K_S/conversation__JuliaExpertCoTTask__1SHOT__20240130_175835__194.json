It iterates over each word in the string and checks if adding that word would exceed the allowed width. If it would, it writes out the current line, resets the result string, and continues. Otherwise, it simply appends the new word onto the current line.\n\nLet's test this function with your example:\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\nThis should output the following:\n```\nThis function \nwill wrap \nwords into \nlines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,272],"elapsed":2.332359102,"_type":"aimessage"}]
