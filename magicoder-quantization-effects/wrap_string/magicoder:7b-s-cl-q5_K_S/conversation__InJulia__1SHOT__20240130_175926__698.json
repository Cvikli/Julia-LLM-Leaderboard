Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can use the `split` method to break down the string into words, then count how many characters are in the current line. When this goes over your desired width, start a new line. Here is a function that accomplishes this:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::AbstractString; text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(s)\n    line = \"\"\n    for word in words\n        if length(line * \" \" * word) > text_width\n            println(line)\n            line = \"\"\n        end\n        line *= word * \" \"\n    end\n    println(line) # print the last line after loop terminates\nend\n```\n\nNow, let's test this function with an example:\n\n```julia\nwrap_string(\"This is a simple test string that will be broken into lines of at most 10 characters each.\")\n```\n\nThis would output something like:\n\n```shell\n\"This is a \"\n\"simple test \"\n\"string that \"\n\"will be \"\n\"broken \"\n\"into lines \"\n\"of at most 10 \"\n\"characters each.\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,267],"elapsed":2.268809843,"_type":"aimessage"}]
