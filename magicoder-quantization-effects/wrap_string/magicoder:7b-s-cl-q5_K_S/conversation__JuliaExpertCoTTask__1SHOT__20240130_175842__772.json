[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided.

This is because each word is added to a line until that line's length exceeds the given `text_width`, at which point a new line is started with that word.","status":200,"tokens":[0,215],"elapsed":1.844991714,"_type":"aimessage"}]
