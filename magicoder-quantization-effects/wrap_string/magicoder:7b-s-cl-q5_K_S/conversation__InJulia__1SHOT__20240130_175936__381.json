It will exceed the text width if not wrapped.\"\nwrap_string(str, 15)\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nThis is a test\nstring that\nneeds to be\nwrapped because\nit's too long.\nIt will exceed\nthe text width\nif not wrapped.\n```\n\nIn the function `wrap_string`, we split the input string into words and then for each word, check if appending it to the current line would result in a line that is wider than `text_width`. If so, print out the current line and start a new one with this word. Repeat until all words are processed. Then print the last remaining line. The resulting lines will be wrapped at `text_width` width.","status":200,"tokens":[0,311],"elapsed":2.6428239,"_type":"aimessage"}]
