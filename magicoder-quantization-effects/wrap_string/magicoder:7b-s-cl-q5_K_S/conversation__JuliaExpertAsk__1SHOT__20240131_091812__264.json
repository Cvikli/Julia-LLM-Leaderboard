For each word, it checks if adding this word to the current line would exceed `text_width`. If so, it appends the current line to the result and starts a new line with just this word. Otherwise, it adds the word to the current line. At the end of iteration, it appends the last line to the result.\n\nHere is an example usage:\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.\", 10))\n```\nThis will print:\n```\nLorem ipsum\ndolor sit\namet,\nconsectetur\nadipiscing\nelit.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,288],"elapsed":2.478713065,"_type":"aimessage"}]
