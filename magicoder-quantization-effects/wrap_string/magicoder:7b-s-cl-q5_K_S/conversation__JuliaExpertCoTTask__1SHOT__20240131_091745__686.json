It checks if adding a new word to the current line would exceed the maximum width; if it would, it appends the current line to the result and starts a new one. At the end of the loop, it appends the final line to the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,229],"elapsed":1.969585515,"_type":"aimessage"}]
