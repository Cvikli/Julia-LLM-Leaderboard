[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded.

For each word, it checks whether adding the current word to the current line would exceed the specified width limit (`text_width`). If it does, a new line is started and the current word is added. Otherwise, the word simply appends to the current line. The process continues until all words have been iterated over.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use `wrap_string`:\n```julia\ninput = \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit\"\nprint(wrap_string(input))\n```\nIn this case, the text `\"Lorem ipsum\"` and `\"consectetur adipiscing\"` will be in different lines because their combined length exceeds the `text_width=10`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,361],"elapsed":2.749687909,"_type":"aimessage"}]
