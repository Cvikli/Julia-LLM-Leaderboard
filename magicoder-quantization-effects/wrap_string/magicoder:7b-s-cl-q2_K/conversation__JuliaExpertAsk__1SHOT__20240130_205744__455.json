Provide an example","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::AbstractString, max_line_width::Int = 10)\n    words = split(s); # split the string into words\n    wrapped_lines = Vector{SubString}(); # initialize an empty vector to hold the lines of text\n\n    current_line_length = 0; # initialize variable for tracking line length\n\n    for word in words\n        if current_line_length + (current_line_length == 0 ? 0 : 1) + length(word) <= max_line_width\n            push!(wrapped_lines, SubString(s, firstindex(s), lastindex(s))) # push the word onto the line\n            s = substr(s, lastindex(s)+1); # update the string to remove the current word from it.\n        else\n            # if we exceeded max width, start a new line\n            current_line_length = 0; # reset the line length\n            push!(wrapped_lines, SubString(s, firstindex(s), lastindex(s))); # push the current line onto our lines array.\n            s = substr(s, lastindex(s)+1); # update the string to remove the current word from it.\n        end\n    end\n\n    return join(wrapped_lines)\nend\n```\n\nThis function iterates over each word in the provided string and checks whether adding the length of the next word exceeds the specified maximum line width. If it does, it starts a new line and continues the iteration from that point. If it doesn't, it just adds the current word to the line and continues with the rest of the words.\n\nExample:\n```julia\ns = \"Hello world this is a test string for wrapping\"\nmax_line_width = 10\nprintln(wrap_string(s, max_line_width)) # Output: Hello\\nworld\\nthis\\nis\\na\\ntest\\nstring\\nfor\\nwrapping\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,469],"elapsed":3.485163081,"_type":"aimessage"}]
