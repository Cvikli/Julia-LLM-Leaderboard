It then checks for each word whether adding it would exceed the text width limit. If so, it appends a newline character and the current line to the result. After that, it sets the current line as just the current word. For any word which when added doesn't cause an overflow, it simply adds the word to the current line. The final line (which may or may not be a full line) is also appended to the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,271],"elapsed":3.030295819,"_type":"aimessage"}]
