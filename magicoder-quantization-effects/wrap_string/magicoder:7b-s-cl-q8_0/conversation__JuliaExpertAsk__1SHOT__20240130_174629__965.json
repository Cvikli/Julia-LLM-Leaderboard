The newline character `\\n` is added between words when wrapping. \n\nLet's use this function with an example:\n\n```julia\ns = \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit\"\nprint(wrap_string(s))\n```\nThis would print:\n\n```julia\nLorem \nipsum \ndolor \nsit \namet, \nconsectetur \nadipiscing \nelit\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,294],"elapsed":3.280281444,"_type":"aimessage"}]
