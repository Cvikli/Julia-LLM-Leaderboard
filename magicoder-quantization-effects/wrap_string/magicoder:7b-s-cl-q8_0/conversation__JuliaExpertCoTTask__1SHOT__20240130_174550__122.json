Then we iterate through each word in that list of words, checking if adding the word to our current line would exceed our maximum text width. If it would, we add a newline character and start a new line. We then append the word to our line. Finally, after we've gone through all the words, we ensure that we still have an entire line left by appending that final line to our resultant string before returning it.\n\nLet's run this function using your example:\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\nThis will output the following:\n```shell\nThis function \nwill wrap \nwords into \nlines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[218,308],"elapsed":19.519640092,"_type":"aimessage"}]
