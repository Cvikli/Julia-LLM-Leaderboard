For each word, it checks if adding that word to the current line would exceed `text_width`. If so, it adds a new line (`\\n`). If not, it just appends a space. The resulting string is the input text with lines wrapped as needed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,200],"elapsed":2.231349178,"_type":"aimessage"}]
