At this point, it starts a new line with the next word. If `text_width` is not provided or exceeded for a particular word, the function will start a new line immediately and continues with the next word.\n\nFor example:\n```julia\nstr = \"This is an example string that needs to be wrapped.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(str))\n```\nThe output would look like this:\n```shell\nThis is an\nexample string\nthat needs\nto be wrapped.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,298],"elapsed":2.327858119,"_type":"aimessage"}]
