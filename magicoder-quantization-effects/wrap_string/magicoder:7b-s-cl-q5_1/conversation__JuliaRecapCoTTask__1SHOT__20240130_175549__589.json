[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded.

It splits the input string into words, and for each word, it checks if adding this word to the current line would exceed the maximum line width (`text_width`). If so, it adds that line to the result (with a newline character at the beginning) and starts a new line with just the current word. If not, it simply adds the word to the current line. At the end of the function, if there is still some text in `line`, this means that the input string didn't fit into complete lines of width `text_width`. So, it appends these remaining words as a new line to the result. Finally, it removes the first newline character from the resulting string and returns it.\n\nAn example usage:\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet\"))\n# Output: \"Lorem ipsum\\ndolor sit amet\"\n\nprintln(wrap_string(\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet\", 12))\n# Output: \"Lorem ipsum dolor\\nsit amet\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,401],"elapsed":3.688377121,"_type":"aimessage"}]
