It should be done by Julia.\", text_width=20))\n```\n\nIn this case, the output will look like:\n\n```\nThis is a \nlong string that \nneeds to be \nwrapped. It \nshould be \ndone by Julia.\n```\n\nThe function `wrap_string` takes in a string and an optional integer `text_width`, defaults to 10 if not provided. The string is split into words using `split(str, \" \")`. Then, the function iterates over these words, checking whether adding each word would exceed the maximum width allowed by comparing the length of the current line plus the length of the new word. If it would exceed this limit, a newline character followed by the current line is added to the result and the line is reset for the next set of words. The loop continues until all words have been processed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,374],"elapsed":3.351153077,"_type":"aimessage"}]
