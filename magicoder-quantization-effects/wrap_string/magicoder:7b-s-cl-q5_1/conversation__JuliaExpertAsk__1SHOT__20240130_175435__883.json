If yes, then it appends a newline character. Else, it just adds a space between the current word and the previous one in the result string. The final result is a string where every line does not exceed `text_width`.\n\nHere's an example usage of this function:\n\n```julia\nprint(wrap_string(\"This is a test sentence to demonstrate wrapping text\", 10))\n```\nThe output will be:\n\n```\nThis is a\ntest sentence\nto demonstrate\nwrapping text\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,266],"elapsed":2.389577713,"_type":"aimessage"}]
