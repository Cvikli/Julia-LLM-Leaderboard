If adding the current word to `result` would exceed the maximum text width (default is 10), it adds a newline before the word. This ensures that no line exceeds the desired width.\n\nThe function can be tested with the following code:\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This is a test string\"))\n# Outputs: \"This is\\na test\\nstring\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,215],"elapsed":1.919429423,"_type":"aimessage"}]
