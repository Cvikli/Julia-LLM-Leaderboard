Then we iterate over these words checking if adding the current word to the result would exceed the maximum allowed width. If it does, we print the result and start a new line for the next word. At the end of all iterations, we print any remaining part in the result.","status":200,"tokens":[94,234],"elapsed":2.115478101,"_type":"aimessage"}]
