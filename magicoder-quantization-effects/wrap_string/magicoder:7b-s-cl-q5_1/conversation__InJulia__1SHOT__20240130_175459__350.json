If it would exceed `text_width`, a new line character (\"\\n\") is added before adding the word. The resulting string has a new line after every `text_width` number of characters, thus wrapping the input string as desired.\n  \nThe example outputs:\n```\nThis is \na very \nlong sentence \nthat should \nbe broken up \ninto multiple \nlines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,256],"elapsed":2.280680554,"_type":"aimessage"}]
