It splits the input string into words, then iterates over each word. If adding the current word to the current line would exceed the `text_width`, it appends the current line to the result (with a newline character) and starts a new line. Finally, it appends the remaining words of the last line to the result.\n\nHere is an example usage:\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This is a test string that will be wrapped\", 12))\n```\nOutput:\n```\nThis is a \ntest string \nthat will be \nwrapped\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,272],"elapsed":2.708482782,"_type":"aimessage"}]
