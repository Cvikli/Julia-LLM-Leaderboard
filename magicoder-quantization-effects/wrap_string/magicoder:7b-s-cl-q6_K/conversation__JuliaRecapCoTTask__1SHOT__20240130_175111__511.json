[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

Then for each word in the list of words, we check if adding it to our current line would exceed the desired text width. If so, we add a newline character (`\\n`) instead. \n\nWe also make sure that we don't start a new line without any content (after the initial or following spaces). We do this by checking `!isempty(result)` before adding a space to the result string.\n\nFinally, we return the resulting string.\n\nYou can test it with the following example:\n\n```julia\nprint(wrap_string(\"This is an example text\", 15))\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```shell\nThis is an\nexample text\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,295],"elapsed":2.908121756,"_type":"aimessage"}]
