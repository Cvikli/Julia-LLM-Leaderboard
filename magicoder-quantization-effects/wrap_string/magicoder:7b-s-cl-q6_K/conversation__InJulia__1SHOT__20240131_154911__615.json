It will wrap at the maximum width.\"\nwrap_string(s, 15)\n```\n\nIn this function, `split` is used to split the input string into an array of words. Then, we iterate over these words. If adding the current word to the current line would exceed the desired text width, we print the current line and start a new one. We then add the current word to the current line. After all words have been processed, we print the remaining part of the string.\n\nThe `wrap_string` function will wrap the input string at every `text_width` characters or words if the resulting strings are longer than `text_width`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,271],"elapsed":2.57589069,"_type":"aimessage"}]
