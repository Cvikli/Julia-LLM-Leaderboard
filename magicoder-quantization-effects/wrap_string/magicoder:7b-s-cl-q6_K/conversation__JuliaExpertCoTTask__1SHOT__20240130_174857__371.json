It then splits the string into an array of words, and for each word, it checks if its length exceeds the specified maximum width. If it does, a newline is added to the output string. The word itself is then appended to the output string, followed by a space. Finally, the result is returned.\n\nThe example provided will wrap the following text into lines with each line having at most 10 characters: \"This function will wrap words into lines\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,307],"elapsed":2.976735659,"_type":"aimessage"}]
