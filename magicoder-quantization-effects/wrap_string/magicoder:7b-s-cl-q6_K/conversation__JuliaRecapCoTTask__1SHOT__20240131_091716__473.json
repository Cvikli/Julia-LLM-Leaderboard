[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded.

For each word, it checks if adding this word to the current line would exceed the maximum text width. If so, it starts a new line. It then adds the word to the current line and continues until all words have been processed. Finally, it returns the resulting string with lines separated by newline characters.\n\nHere is an example of how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\ns = \"This is a test string that will be wrapped.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(s))\n```\nIn this case, the output would be:\n\n```julia\n\"This is a \ntest string \nthat will be \nwrapped.\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,281],"elapsed":2.785465709,"_type":"aimessage"}]
