If it does, it starts a new line. It continues this until all words are processed, then it returns the resulting string.\n\nHere is an example of how you can use it:\n\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\n\nIt should print:\n\n```shell\nThis function\nwill wrap\nwords into\nlines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,247],"elapsed":2.365582273,"_type":"aimessage"}]
