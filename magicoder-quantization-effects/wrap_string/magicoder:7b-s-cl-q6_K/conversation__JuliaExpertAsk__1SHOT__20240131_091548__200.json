If it does, it adds a newline character and starts a new line. It then returns the resulting string with lines separated by newlines. \n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nprint(wrap_string(\"This is a test of wrapping text\", 15))\n```\n\nThe output will be:\n```\nThis is a test\nof wrapping text\n```","status":200,"tokens":[94,236],"elapsed":2.345220568,"_type":"aimessage"}]
