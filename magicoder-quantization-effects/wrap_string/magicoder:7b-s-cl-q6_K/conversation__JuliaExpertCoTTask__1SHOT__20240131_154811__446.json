Then for each word in the array, it checks if adding the word to the current line would exceed the maximum width. If it does, it prints the current line and starts a new one with the current word. Otherwise, it adds the word to the current line.\n\nWhen you run this code, it will print:\n```julia\nThis function \nwill wrap words \ninto lines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,232],"elapsed":2.22111555,"_type":"aimessage"}]
