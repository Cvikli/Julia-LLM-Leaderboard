If the length of the current word exceeds the maximum allowed width, then it is added to a result array and a new line character \"\\n\" is also added. If not, the word will be joined with any existing words (if there are) and compared with the max width again. If it fits, it'll add to the result; otherwise, the word will start a new line. Finally, we join all elements in `result` into a single string separated by spaces.","status":200,"tokens":[94,310],"elapsed":3.014468507,"_type":"aimessage"}]
