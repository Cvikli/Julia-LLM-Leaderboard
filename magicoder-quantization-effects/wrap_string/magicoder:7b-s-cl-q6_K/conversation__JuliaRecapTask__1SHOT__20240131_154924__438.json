[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

For each word, it checks if adding the word to the current line would exceed the `text_width`. If so, it adds the current line to the list of wrapped lines and starts a new one with just the current word. Otherwise, it simply adds the word to the current line. After iterating over all words, it checks if there are remaining words in the current line (i.e., the loop didn't end on an empty line), and if so, it adds these remaining words to the last line before returning the final list of wrapped lines as a string with newlines between each line.\n\nExample:\n```julia\ns = \"This is a test string that will be wrapped\"\nprintln(wrap_string(s))\n```\nOutput:\n```\nThis is \na test \nstring that \nwill be \nwrapped\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,422],"elapsed":4.132746033,"_type":"aimessage"}]
