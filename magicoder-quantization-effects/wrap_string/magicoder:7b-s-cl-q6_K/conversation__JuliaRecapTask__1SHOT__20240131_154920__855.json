[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

It will be broken up into multiple lines if necessary.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(s))\n```\nIn this function, we split the input string into words and then add each word to a new line only when it would exceed the maximum `text_width`. The function handles strings with spaces between words correctly. It also adds an extra newline at the end of the result to separate the final line from other output.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that you want to split your string by spaces and that a word is any sequence of characters separated by spaces, so punctuation marks will be treated as part of the preceding word. If you have different requirements, you may need to modify this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,286],"elapsed":2.788528132,"_type":"aimessage"}]
