Provide an example","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I'll write the following function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::String, text_width::Int = 10)\n    words = split(s, \" \")\n    wrapped_lines = String[]\n    \n    current_line = \"\"\n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line * \" $word\") > text_width\n            push!(wrapped_lines, current_line)\n            current_line = \"$word\"\n        else\n            current_line *= \" $word\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # add the last line after the loop has finished\n    push!(wrapped_lines, current_line)\n    \n    return joined_string = join(wrapped_lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function splits the string into words. Then it iterates over each word and if adding a new word to the current line would exceed `text_width`, it adds that line to an array of lines and starts a new line with the current word. Finally, it joins all lines into a single string with newlines between them and returns it.\n\nLet's test this function:\n```julia\nprint(wrap_string(\"This is a very long string that will be wrapped\", 10))\n```\nIt should produce the following output:\n```julia\n\"This is a very\\nlong string\\nthat will be\\nwrapped\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,331],"elapsed":3.199682787,"_type":"aimessage"}]
