This is a test.\", 10))\n```\nThis function works by splitting the input string into words, then iterating over each word. If adding the current word to the line would exceed the `text_width`, it adds a newline character to the output and starts a new line. It then adds the word to the line. The number of characters in the current line is incremented by the length of the current word plus one for the space separator.\n\nIn this example, it will wrap the string at 10 characters per line:\n```\nHello World!\nThis is a test.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,292],"elapsed":2.512318118,"_type":"aimessage"}]
