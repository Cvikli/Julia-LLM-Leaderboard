If adding a word would exceed `text_width`, we start a new line with write(result, \"\\n\") and reset the line \"line\". We then continue on our current line until reaching the end of the input list of words. \n\nHere is an example usage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Hello\", \"world!\", \"This\", \"is\", \"a\", \"test.\"]\nprintln(wrap_string(words))\n```\nThe output should be:\n\n```shell\nHello world!\nThis is a test.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,264],"elapsed":2.254836858,"_type":"aimessage"}]
