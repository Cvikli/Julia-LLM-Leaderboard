The function iterates over each word, checking if adding the length of this new word to the length of the current line exceeds the maximum text width. If it does, a newline character (`\"\\n\"`) is added to the resultant string and a new line started, otherwise, just add the word to the current line. Finally, all lines are joined together with a single space between each word.\n\nWhen you call `wrap_string` with the provided example sentence, it will return:\n\n```\n\"This function\\nwill wrap words\\ninto lines\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,281],"elapsed":2.458587049,"_type":"aimessage"}]
