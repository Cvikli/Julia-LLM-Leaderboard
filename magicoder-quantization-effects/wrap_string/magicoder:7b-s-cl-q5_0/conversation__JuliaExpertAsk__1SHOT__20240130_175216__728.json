The wrapped text is returned as a new string where each line of the wrapped text is separated by a newline character ('\\n').\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\", 10))\n```\nOutputs:\n```\nThe quick\nbrown fox\njumps over\nthe lazy\ndog\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,288],"elapsed":2.485043042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
