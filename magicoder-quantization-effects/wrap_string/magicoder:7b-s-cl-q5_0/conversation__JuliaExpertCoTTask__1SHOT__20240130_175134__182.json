Then, for each word, it checks if adding the word to the current line (separated by a space) would exceed `text_width`. If so, it appends the current line to `output` and starts a new line. Finally, it appends the remaining line of text to `output`.\n\nLet's run this function with your example:\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\n\nThis will output:\n```\nThis function \nwill wrap \nwords into \nlines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,266],"elapsed":2.283313135,"_type":"aimessage"}]
