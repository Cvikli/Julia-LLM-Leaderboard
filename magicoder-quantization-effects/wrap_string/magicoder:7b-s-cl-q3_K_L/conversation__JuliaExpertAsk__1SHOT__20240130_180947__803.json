Cras a nunc sed turpis commodo dictum.\"\nprint(wrap_string(text))\n```\nThis will break the input text at each new line if it exceeds `text_width` characters and add a newline character between every word. The default value of `text_width` is 10, so in this example, the lines should be around 10 characters long, but can vary depending on your input text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,272],"elapsed":2.16888463,"_type":"aimessage"}]
