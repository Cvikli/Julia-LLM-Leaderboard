If it exceeds the maximum `text_width`, it adds the current line to `lines` (stored as a newline-separated string), clears `line`, and continues on with the next word. The function finally pushes `line` (without the trailing whitespace) onto `lines` after it has processed all words, then returns a single string where each line is separated by a newline character.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This is a test of the wrapping function\"))\n# Output:\n# This is a \n# test of \n# the wrapping \n# function\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,298],"elapsed":2.38404835,"_type":"aimessage"}]
