We split the input string into individual words using the `split` function. The resulting array is then iterated over. For each word, we check if adding it to our result would exceed the specified line width. If so, we start a new line. We add the current word followed by a space to our result and increase the length of the current line. Finally, we return the result string which contains the input string wrapped according to the specified text width.","status":200,"tokens":[0,269],"elapsed":2.175817527,"_type":"aimessage"}]
