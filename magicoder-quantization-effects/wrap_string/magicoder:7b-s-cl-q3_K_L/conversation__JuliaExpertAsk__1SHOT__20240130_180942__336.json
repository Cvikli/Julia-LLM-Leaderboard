This is a test.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(text, 15))\n```\nThis will wrap the text to fit within the width of 15 characters per line:\n\n```julia\n\"Hello \\nWorld Julia\\nprogramming \\nlanguage. \\nThis is a \\ntest.\"\n```\nPlease note that this function only wraps words based on their length and not taking into account the graphical representation of text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,228],"elapsed":1.814532475,"_type":"aimessage"}]
