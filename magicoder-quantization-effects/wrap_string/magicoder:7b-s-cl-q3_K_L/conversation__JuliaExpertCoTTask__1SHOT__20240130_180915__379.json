The function first splits the input string into a vector of words. Then it iterates over these words, adding them one by one to `current_line`. If the length of `current_line` after adding the next word would exceed `text_width`, it adds `current_line` to `lines` and starts a new `current_line`. At the end of the loop, if there are remaining words in `current_line`, they're added to `lines`. The function finally joins `lines` into a single string with newline characters between each line and returns it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,371],"elapsed":3.01580394,"_type":"aimessage"}]
