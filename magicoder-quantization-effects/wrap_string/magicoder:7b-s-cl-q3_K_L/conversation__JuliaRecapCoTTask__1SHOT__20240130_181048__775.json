[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

Then it iterates over these words to check if adding each word to a current line would exceed `text_width`. If this happens, it pushes the current line into an array of lines and starts a new line with the next word. After going through all words, it pushes the last line (if it's not empty) into the array of lines. Finally, it joins all lines together with newline characters to form the final output string.\n\nExample:\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"Hello World! This is a test.\"))\n```\nOutput:\n```\nHello World! \nThis is a test.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,281],"elapsed":2.319965754,"_type":"aimessage"}]
