Provide an example","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can implement the requested function in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s, text_width::Int = 10)\n    words = split(s, \" \")\n    result = \"\"\n    for word in words\n        if length(result) + length(word) > text_width || length(result) == 0\n            result *= \"\\n\"\n        elseif !isempty(result)\n            result *= \" \"\n        end\n        result *= word\n    end\n    return result\nend\n\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This is a test. This is only a test.\", 10))\n```\n\nIn this function, we split the input string into words by space. Then, for each word, we check if it can be added to the current line without exceeding the text width (plus one character for the space). If not, we start a new line. We also add an extra newline in between paragraphs (if any), and a space between words within a single paragraph. The resulting string is then returned as output.","status":200,"tokens":[0,238],"elapsed":1.896827059,"_type":"aimessage"}]
