It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(input::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(input, \" \")\n    output = \"\"\n    for word in words\n        if length(output) + length(word) > text_width\n            write(output * \"\\n\")\n            output = word\n        else\n            output *= \" \" * word\n        end\n    end\n    return output\nend\n```\nThis function `wrap_string` takes a string and an optional integer for the width of each line. It splits the input string into words, then iterates through them. If adding the current word to the existing output would exceed the text width, it starts a new line by appending a newline character to the output, then sets the output as just the current word. If adding the current word to the existing output does not exceed the text width, it adds a space and the word to the end of the output. Finally, the function returns the complete output string.\n\nExample usage: \n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\nThis would return:\n```\nThis function\nwill wrap words\ninto lines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,274],"elapsed":2.205289047,"_type":"aimessage"}]
