Then, I iterate over each word in the array. If adding a space and the length of the current word would exceed `text_width`, I add a newline character to `new_str` (and reset `line_length`) before appending the word. This ensures that every new line does not exceed `text_width`. \n\nThe test example is:\n\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\nIt should print:\n\n```\nThis function\nwill wrap\nwords into\nlines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,329],"elapsed":2.650303912,"_type":"aimessage"}]
