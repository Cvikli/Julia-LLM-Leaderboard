[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided.

It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia code for this problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(input_str::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(input_str, \" \")\n    result = \"\"\n    line_length = 0\n    for word in words\n        if line_length + length(word) > text_width\n            result *= \"\\n\"\n            line_length = 0\n        else\n            line_length += length(word) + 1\n        end\n        result *= \" $word\"\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\nThe above function works as follows:\n\n- It first splits the input string into words.\n- Then, for each word, it checks if adding this word to the current line would exceed the maximum text width. If so, a newline character is added and the current line length is reset to 0. Otherwise, the word is appended to the current line with a space in between. The line length is updated by adding the length of the word and 1 (for the space).\n- After all words have been processed, the result string is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[218,255],"elapsed":10.723524878,"_type":"aimessage"}]
