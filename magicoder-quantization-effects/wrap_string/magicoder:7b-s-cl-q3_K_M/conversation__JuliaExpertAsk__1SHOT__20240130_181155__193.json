If it does, a newline character is appended to `result`. The function then adds the next word to the end of the current line, with a space before the word for proper formatting.\n\nFor example:\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This is an example text\", 10))\n```\nOutputs:\n```\nThis is\nan example\ntext\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,238],"elapsed":1.834614779,"_type":"aimessage"}]
