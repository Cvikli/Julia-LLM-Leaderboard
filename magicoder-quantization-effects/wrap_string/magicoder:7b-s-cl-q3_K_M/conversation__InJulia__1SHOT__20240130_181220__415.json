It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem by creating a function that breaks down the input string into chunks of specified width, and then joins them together with newline characters in between. Here's how you might write it:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(str::String; text_width::Int = 10)\n    words = split(str, \" \")\n    lines = []\n    curr_line = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(curr_line * \" \" * word) <= text_width && !isempty(curr_line)\n            # Add word to current line\n            push!(lines, curr_line * \" \")\n            curr_line = word\n        elseif length(word) <= text_width \n            # If adding word would exceed width, start new line\n            push!(lines, curr_line)\n            curr_line = word\n        else\n            # Otherwise, add the first part of the word to the current line and start a new one\n            push!(lines, curr_line * \" \" * string(word[1:text_width-length(curr_line)]))\n            curr_line = string(word[text_width-length(curr_line)+1:end])\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Add the remaining line if it exists\n    if !isempty(curr_line)\n        push!(lines, curr_line)\n    end\n    \n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\nstr = \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Integer id dictum nibh.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(str))\n```\nThe output would be a multi-line string where each line does not exceed 10 characters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,410],"elapsed":3.140717161,"_type":"aimessage"}]
