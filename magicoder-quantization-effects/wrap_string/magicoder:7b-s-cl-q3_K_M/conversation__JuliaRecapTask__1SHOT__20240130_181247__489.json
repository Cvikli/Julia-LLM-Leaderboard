[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

It then iterates over each word and checks whether adding this word to the current line would cause it exceed `text_width`. If so, it pushes the current line into a vector of lines (`lines`) and starts a new line with the current word. Otherwise, it adds the current word to the current line. After all words have been processed, it pushes the last line to `lines` as well. Finally, it joins all lines in `lines` into a single string separated by newline characters `\\n`, which is returned by the function.\n\nThe example input text \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.\" will be printed:\n\n```julia\nLorem ipsum \ndolor sit \namet, \nconsectetur \nadipiscing \nelit.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,369],"elapsed":2.914037937,"_type":"aimessage"}]
