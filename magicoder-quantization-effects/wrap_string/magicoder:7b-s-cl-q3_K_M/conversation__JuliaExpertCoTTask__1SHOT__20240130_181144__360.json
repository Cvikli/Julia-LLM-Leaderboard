If the length of the current line plus a space and the next word would exceed `text_width`, we push the current line onto our results array and start a new line with just the next word. We repeat this process until all words have been processed.\n\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\", text_width=20))\n```\n\nThe expected output would be:\n```text\nThis function\nwill wrap \nwords into \nlines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,272],"elapsed":2.104714941,"_type":"aimessage"}]
