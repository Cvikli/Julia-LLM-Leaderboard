It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia code for your problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(s, \" \")\n    result = \"\"\n    line = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(line * \" $word\") > text_width\n            result *= \"\\n\"\n            result *= line\n            line = \"\"\n        end\n        \n        line *= \" $word\"\n    end\n    \n    return result * line\nend\n```\nYou can use the function like this:\n\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\", 10))\n```\n\nThe `split` function is used to split the string into an array of words. The for loop iterates over each word, and if adding a new line would exceed the maximum width, it starts a new line. It then adds the word to the current line. After all words have been processed, it appends the remaining line to the result. Finally, it returns the resulting string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,241],"elapsed":1.931647539,"_type":"aimessage"}]
