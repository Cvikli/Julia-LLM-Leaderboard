Provide an example","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple solution in Julia using string manipulation and the split() method:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(str, text_width = 10)\n    words = split(str, \" \") # splits str into array of words\n    result = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(result)*length(word) > text_width*text_width\n            result *= \"\\n\"\n        end\n        \n        result *= \" $word\" # adds a space after the first character and then concatenates with next word\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n\n# Testing example:\nprintln(wrap_string(\"Hello world! This is a test.\"))\n```\nThis function splits the input string into words, checks the length of current string and each new word. If adding the next word would exceed `text_width`, it starts a new line. The resulting output should look something like this: \n\n```bash\nHello world!\nThis is a test.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,229],"elapsed":1.882583302,"_type":"aimessage"}]
