Then, for each word, it checks whether adding this word to the current line would exceed the specified `text_width`. If not, it appends the word to the line; if so, it prints out the line and starts a new one with the current word. Finally, after iterating over all words, it prints out the last line.\n\nYou can now call this function with your example:\n```julia\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")\n```\nThis will print:\n```\nThis function \nwill wrap words \ninto lines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,245],"elapsed":1.965560799,"_type":"aimessage"}]
