It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the `wrap_string` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::String, text_width::Int = 10)\n    words = split(s, \" \")\n    lines = String[]\n    current_line = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line * \" $word\") > text_width\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = \"\"\n        end\n        current_line *= \" $word\"\n    end\n\n    # Push the last line\n    push!(lines, current_line)\n\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function splits the input string into words and checks whether adding a new word to the current line would exceed `text_width`. If it does, it starts a new line. The result is a string where each line is no longer than `text_width`.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use this function:\n\n```julia\nstr = \"This is a test string that needs to be wrapped to ensure it fits within the specified width\"\nprintln(wrap_string(str))\n```\n\nNote that this will wrap at spaces, so words may be split across lines if they are too long. If you want to handle punctuation properly (e.g., not splitting a sentence after the period), you'll need a more complex solution.","status":200,"tokens":[0,318],"elapsed":2.543757225,"_type":"aimessage"}]
