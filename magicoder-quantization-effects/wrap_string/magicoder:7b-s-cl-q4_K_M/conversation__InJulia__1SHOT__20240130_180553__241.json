It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve the problem using Julia's built-in `split` function to split the string into words, then iterate through these words, adding them one by one to the result. Whenever a new line needs to be started due to reaching the maximum width, you add a newline character before appending the next word. Here is how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::AbstractString; text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(s, \" \")  # Split string into words\n    result = \"\"  # Initialize empty result string\n    line_length = 0  \n\n    for word in words\n        if line_length == 0 || (line_length + length(word)) <= text_width\n            # Append current word to the end of the line without any spaces\n            result *= \"$word \"\n            line_length += length(word) + 1  \n        else\n            result *= \"\\n\"  # Start a new line\n            line_length = 0\n        end\n    end\n    return result\nend\n\n# Test the function with an example\ns = \"This is a sample text to test wrapping functionality.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(s, text_width=15))\n```\nThe `split` function splits the input string into words by spaces. Then it iterates through these words and checks if adding another word would exceed the maximum width. If not, it adds the word to the current line. If it would exceed the maximum width, it starts a new line. The result is then returned as a string where each line is separated by a newline character.\nIn this example, \"This is a sample text to test wrapping functionality.\" gets printed over multiple lines when `text_width` is 15 because every word is longer than 15 characters long.","status":200,"tokens":[0,404],"elapsed":3.241042911,"_type":"aimessage"}]
