[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

For each word, it checks if adding this word to the current line would exceed `text_width`. If so, it appends a newline character followed by the current line to the result and resets the line to be just the current word. If not, it adds the word to the end of the current line with a space in between. In the end, if there are any remaining words left over after iterating all the words, they are appended at the end of the result followed by a newline character.\n\nThe example usage wraps the string \"This is a test string that will be wrapped to fit within the given width.\" into lines with maximum 20 characters each, and prints out the resulting string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,322],"elapsed":2.634987521,"_type":"aimessage"}]
