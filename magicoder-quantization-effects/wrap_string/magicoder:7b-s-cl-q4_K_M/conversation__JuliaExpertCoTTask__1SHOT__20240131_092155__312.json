For each word, it checks whether adding a newline character would exceed `text_width`. If so, it appends a newline and the current line to the result string, and starts a new line. It then continues with the next word. Finally, after all words have been processed, it appends the last line to the result string.\n\nLet's test this function:\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\nThe output should be:\n```\nThis function \nwill wrap \nwords into \nlines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,275],"elapsed":2.250636638,"_type":"aimessage"}]
