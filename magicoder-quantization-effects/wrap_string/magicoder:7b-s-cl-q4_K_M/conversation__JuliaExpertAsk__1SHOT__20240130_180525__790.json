It splits the string into words using `split`, then iterates over each word, checking if adding it to the current line would exceed the `text_width`. If so, it adds the current line to the result and starts a new one. Finally, it appends any remaining content after all iterations as well.","status":200,"tokens":[0,316],"elapsed":2.531869173,"_type":"aimessage"}]
