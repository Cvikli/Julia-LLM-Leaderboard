It will be wrapped if necessary.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(str, 15))\n```\n\nIn this case, it wraps after every 15 characters, so you'll see a new line after each word in the example output. You can change `text_width` to adjust how many characters are allowed on each line.","status":200,"tokens":[0,228],"elapsed":1.849745246,"_type":"aimessage"}]
