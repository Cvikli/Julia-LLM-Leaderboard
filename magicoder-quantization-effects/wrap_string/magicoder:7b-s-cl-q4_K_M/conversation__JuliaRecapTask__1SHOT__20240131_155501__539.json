[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

If adding a new word to the current line would exceed `text_width`, it starts a new line for that word. It then returns the final string with lines separated by newline characters `\\n`. \n\nFor example, if you call `wrap_string(\"Hello world\", 10)`, it will return `\"Hello\\nworld\"`, because \"Hello\" and \"world\" fit into one line of width 10 each. But if you call `wrap_string(\"Hello world this is a test\", 10)`, it would return `\"Hello\\nworld this\\nis a test\"`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,277],"elapsed":2.27589087,"_type":"aimessage"}]
