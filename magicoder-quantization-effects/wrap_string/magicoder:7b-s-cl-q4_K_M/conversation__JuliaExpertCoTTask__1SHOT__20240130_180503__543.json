It splits the input string into individual words using `split`, then iterates over each word. For each word, it checks if adding that word to the current line would exceed the maximum width. If so, it adds a newline character before adding the word to the output string. After appending a word to the current line, it also adds a space for proper spacing between words. Finally, it returns the resulting output string. When called with the example input \"This function will wrap words into lines\", it prints:\n```julia\n\"This function \nwill wrap words \ninto lines\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,262],"elapsed":2.101584398,"_type":"aimessage"}]
