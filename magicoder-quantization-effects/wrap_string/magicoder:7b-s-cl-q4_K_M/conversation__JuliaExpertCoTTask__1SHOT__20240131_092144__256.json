It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia code that solves this problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    result = \"\"\n    line = \"\"\n    for word in words\n        if length(line * \" \" * word) > text_width\n            result *= \"\\n\" * line\n            line = word\n        else\n            line *= \" \" * word\n        end\n    end\n    return result * \"\\n\" * line\nend\n```\nThis function splits the input string into words and then iterates over each word. For each word, it checks whether adding this word to the current line would exceed the maximum width. If so, it adds a newline character before the word and starts a new line. Otherwise, it just appends the word to the current line. After going through all the words, it adds the remaining line to the result.\n\nYou can use the function with your example like this:\n\n```julia\nprint(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\nThe output should be:\n\n```\nThis function \nwill wrap \nwords into \nlines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,266],"elapsed":2.19954159,"_type":"aimessage"}]
