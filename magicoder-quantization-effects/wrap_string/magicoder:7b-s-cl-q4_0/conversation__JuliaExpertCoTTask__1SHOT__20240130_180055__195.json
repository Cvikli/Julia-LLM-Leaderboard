Then a for loop iterates over each word in the array and checks if adding it would exceed `text_width`. If it does, a newline character is printed and `str` (the current line) is reset. Otherwise, `word` is added to `str`. At the end of the function, we print out whatever remains in `str`, which should be the last line that didn't reach `text_width`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,232],"elapsed":1.754244663,"_type":"aimessage"}]
