Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you might write this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int = 10)\n    words = split(text, \" \")\n    line_length = 0\n    result = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        if line_length + length(word) > text_width\n            result *= \"\\n\"\n            line_length = 0\n        elseif !isempty(result)\n            result *= \" \"\n            line_length += 1\n        end\n        \n        result *= word\n        line_length += length(word)\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the input string into words and iterating over them. If adding a new word would exceed `text_width`, it starts a new line (by appending `\"\\n\"` to `result`). It also adds a space between words, unless this is the first word in the result.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\ntext = \"This is a test text that needs to be wrapped\"\nprint(wrap_string(text))\n```\n\nThe output of running this will look like this (formatted for clarity):\n```julia\n\"This is a \ntest text that \nneeds to be \nwrapped\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,309],"elapsed":2.321971295,"_type":"aimessage"}]
