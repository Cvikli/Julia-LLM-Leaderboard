[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

It will exceed the text width if not properly handled.\"))\n```\n\nThe output of this script should look like this:\n\n```julia\n\"This is a very long sentence that \nneeds to be wrapped. \nIt will exceed the text width if \nnot properly handled.\"\n```\n\nThis function splits the input string into words, then iterates over these words and checks whether adding each word to the current line would cause it to surpass `text_width`. If so, it adds the current line to our results and starts a new one with this word. Otherwise, it just keeps adding words to the current line. At the end of the loop, it adds the final line to our results. Finally, it joins all lines into a single string with newline characters between each line.","status":200,"tokens":[0,433],"elapsed":3.370658448,"_type":"aimessage"}]
