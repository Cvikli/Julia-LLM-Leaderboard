It splits the input string into words, then iterates over these words. For each word, it checks if adding this word to the current line would exceed the `text_width`. If so, it appends the current line to the result (with a newline character), and starts a new line with just the current word. Otherwise, it adds the word to the current line. It then returns the final result string, which contains all the words in lines of no more than `text_width` length.\n\nHere is an example usage:\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.\", 15))\n```\nThis will output:\n```\nLorem ipsum\ndolor sit\namet,\nconsectetur\nadipiscing\nelit.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,329],"elapsed":2.528579306,"_type":"aimessage"}]
