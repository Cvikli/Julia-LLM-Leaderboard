Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(str, text_width::Int = 10)\n    words = split(str, \" \")\n    lines = String[]\n    line = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        if length(line * \" \" * word) > text_width\n            push!(lines, line)\n            line = \"\"\n        end\n        \n        line *= (word * \" \")\n    end\n\n    # Add the last line\n    push!(lines, line)\n\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function takes a string and an optional text width. It splits the string into words and checks if adding a new word to the current line would exceed the text width. If it does, it adds the current line (without the trailing space) to the result array `lines` and starts a new line. \n\nIt keeps adding words until all words have been added or the maximum width has been reached, then it joins all the lines with newline characters between them and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[64,244],"elapsed":1.86030969,"_type":"aimessage"}]
