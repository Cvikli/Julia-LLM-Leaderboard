It will wrap to a new line if it exceeds 10 characters.\"))\n```\nIn this code, `split` is used to split the input string into words. Then, for each word in the list of words, we check whether adding the current word and a space to the end of the current string would exceed `text_width`. If it would, we add a newline character (`\\n`) instead; otherwise, we just add the word and a space. The final result is returned as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,228],"elapsed":1.713522612,"_type":"aimessage"}]
