It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia code for your request:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::String, text_width::Int = 10)\n    words = split(s, \" \")\n    result = \"\"\n    line = \"\"\n    for word in words\n        if length(line * \" \" * word) > text_width\n            result *= \"\\n\" * line\n            line = word\n        else\n            line *= \" \" * word\n        end\n    end\n    return result * \"\\n\" * line\nend\n```\nThis function splits the input string into words, then iterates over each word. If adding a new word to the current line would exceed `text_width`, it starts a new line and adds the current word. Otherwise, it just adds the word to the current line. The result is returned as a single string with newline characters separating lines.\n\nHere's an example:\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.\", 20))\n```\nThis will output:\n```\nLorem ipsum dolor sit \namet, consectetur \nadipiscing elit.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,274],"elapsed":2.067033933,"_type":"aimessage"}]
