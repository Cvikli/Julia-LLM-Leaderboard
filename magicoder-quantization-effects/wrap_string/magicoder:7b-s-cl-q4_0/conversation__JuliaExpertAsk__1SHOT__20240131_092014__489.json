If it does, it starts a new line with this word. The function then returns the final string with all lines separated by newline characters.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\ns = \"This is an example of wrapping text\"\nprint(wrap_string(s))\n```\nThe output will be:\n```\nThis is an \nexample of \nwrapping text\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,242],"elapsed":1.809010028,"_type":"aimessage"}]
