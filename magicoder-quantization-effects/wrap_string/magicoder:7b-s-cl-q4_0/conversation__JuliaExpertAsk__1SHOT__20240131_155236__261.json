The default value of `text_width` is 10. It splits the input string into words, then iterates over each word. For each word, it checks if adding the current word to the line would exceed `text_width`. If so, it adds the current line to the result and starts a new line. It then continues with the next word. After all words have been processed, it adds any remaining words in the current line to the result.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"Hello world this is a test\", 15))\n```\nThis will output:\n\n```\nHello world\nthis is a test\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,286],"elapsed":2.148679428,"_type":"aimessage"}]
