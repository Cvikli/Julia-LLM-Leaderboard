It checks each time whether adding a new word would cause the line length to exceed `text_width`. If so, it adds a newline character and resets the line to just this word. After going through all words, if there's still some text left on the current line that hasn't been added to the result yet (the case where not all words fit in one line), it is added at the end of the function's output.","status":200,"tokens":[0,286],"elapsed":2.147961724,"_type":"aimessage"}]
