It splits the input string into words. Then it iterates over each word, adding them to a line. Whenever adding a new word would exceed `text_width`, it appends the current line to the result (with a newline character) and starts a new line. At the end of the loop, it adds the remaining line to the result.\n\nHere's an example:\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This is a test string\", 10))\n```\nOutput:\n```\nThis is a \ntest string\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,275],"elapsed":2.084201767,"_type":"aimessage"}]
