Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In order to solve this problem, we need to perform several operations. \n- First, we will check if the input list is empty and return a named tuple with nothing as its value in each field.\n- Then, we will calculate the average, maximum, minimum temperatures using `Statistics` package.\n- Next, we will determine whether the trend of temperature data is increasing, decreasing or stable. \n\nHere's how to implement this function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        # Determine the trend based on the difference between consecutive values in temps.\n        if isempty(diff(temps)) || all(x -> x > 0, diff(temps))\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif all(x -> x < 0, diff(temps))\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n        \n        return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty or not. If it's empty, then it returns a named tuple with all fields set to nothing. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures using `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from `Statistics` package respectively. After that, it determines the trend of temperature data using `diff(temps)` function which gives difference between consecutive elements in `temps`. If all differences are positive or there are no differences at all (implying the temperatures didn't change), then it is marked as :increasing. If all differences are negative, then it is marked as :decreasing. Otherwise, it is marked as :stable. The result of these computations is returned in a named tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,480],"elapsed":4.172977964,"_type":"aimessage"}]
