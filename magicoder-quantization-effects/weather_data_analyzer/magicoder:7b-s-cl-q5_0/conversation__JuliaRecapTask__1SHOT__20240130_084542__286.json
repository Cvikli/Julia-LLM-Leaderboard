[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers).

If the list is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average temperature using the `mean` function from the Statistics package. The maximum and minimum temperatures are calculated by calling the `maximum` and `minimum` functions, respectively. \n\nThe trend is determined based on whether the second day's temperature was higher than or lower than the first day's temperature. If the temperature increased on the next day, it returns `:increasing`, if it decreased it returns `:decreasing`, otherwise it returns `:stable`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,305],"elapsed":2.708191862,"_type":"aimessage"}]
