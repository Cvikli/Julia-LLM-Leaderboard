Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you could implement such a function in Julia. Note that this function assumes that the input list contains only numbers and does not handle any exceptions:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if average > max_temp\n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif average < min_temp\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average = average, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf the list is not empty, it calculates the average temperature, the maximum temperature, and the minimum temperature. The `trend` is then determined based on the relation between the average temperature and the extremes of the data range. It uses the `mean` function from the `Statistics` package to compute the average, and the `maximum` and `minimum` functions to find the maximum and minimum temperatures respectively. \n\nThe final named tuple is then returned containing these computed values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,336],"elapsed":2.907660172,"_type":"aimessage"}]
