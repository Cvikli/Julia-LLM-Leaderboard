Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could implement this in Julia. Note that the solution assumes that we are using the Statistics package and DataStructures.jl for creating named tuples:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics, DataStructures\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Check if list is empty\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    # Calculate the average temperature\n    avg = mean(temps)\n\n    # Find out the maximum and minimum temperatures\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Determine the trend based on the difference between consecutive elements in temps\n    diffs = diff(temps)\n    \n    if all(x -> x > 0, diffs)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(x -> x < 0, diffs)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    # Return results as a named tuple\n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\ntemps = [25, 30, 29, 31, 28]\nprint(weather_data_analyzer(temps))\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,346],"elapsed":2.991786518,"_type":"aimessage"}]
