Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below you'll find one of possible solutions in Julia. Please note that it assumes that you have already installed and imported the Statistics package: \n\n```julia\nusing Statistics \n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Check if the list is empty\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    maxT = maximum(temps)\n    minT = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Determine the trend based on the difference between consecutive elements in list\n    diffs = [abs(temps[i+1] - temps[i]) for i in 1:length(temps)-1]\n    trend = diffs == 0 ? :stable : (diffs[1] < diffs[2] ? :increasing : :decreasing)\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=maxT, min=minT, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. If not, it calculates the mean (`average`), maximum (`max`), and minimum temperatures (`min`), as well as determines the trend based on whether the difference between consecutive days' temperatures is increasing or decreasing.","status":200,"tokens":[184,318],"elapsed":2.781457405,"_type":"aimessage"}]
