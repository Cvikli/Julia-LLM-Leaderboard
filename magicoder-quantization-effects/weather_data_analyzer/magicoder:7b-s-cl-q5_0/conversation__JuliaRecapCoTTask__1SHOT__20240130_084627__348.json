[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how this function could be written in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        stats = mapreduce(x -> [x], vcat => identity, temps)  # calculate stats over the list of lists\n        avg_temp, max_temp, min_temp = mean(stats), maximum(stats), minimum(stats)\n\n        if max_temp - min_temp >= 0.0\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif max_temp - min_temp < 0.0\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n\n        return (; average=avg_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this function, `mapreduce` applies the function `[x -> [x]]` to each element of `temps`, concatenating them all together. `vcat => identity` tells `mapreduce` to perform a reduction (concatenation) operation on the lists. If the list is empty, it will return a tuple with values set to nothing.\n\nThe trend is determined by checking if the difference between maximum and minimum temperatures is greater than or equal to zero. If it is, then the trend is :increasing; if less than zero, then :decreasing; otherwise, it's :stable. \n\nYou can use this function with a list of daily temperature data like so: `weather_data_analyzer([[28], [30], [29], [35], [31]])` and it will return a named tuple with the average, maximum, minimum temperatures, and trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,429],"elapsed":3.823805818,"_type":"aimessage"}]
