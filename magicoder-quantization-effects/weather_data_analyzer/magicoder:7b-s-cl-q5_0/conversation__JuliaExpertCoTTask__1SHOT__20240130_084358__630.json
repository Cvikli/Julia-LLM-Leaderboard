Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use the Julia programming language and its built-in statistics functions from the Statistics package. Here is a simple implementation of this task:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        trend = nothing\n        \n        if length(temps) >= 2\n            if temps[1] <= temps[2]\n                trend = :increasing\n            elseif temps[1] > temps[2]\n                trend = :decreasing\n            end\n        end\n        \n        return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. \nOtherwise, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures from the data, and also checks if the temperature values are increasing or decreasing (for trend). It then returns this information in a named tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,293],"elapsed":2.544735183,"_type":"aimessage"}]
