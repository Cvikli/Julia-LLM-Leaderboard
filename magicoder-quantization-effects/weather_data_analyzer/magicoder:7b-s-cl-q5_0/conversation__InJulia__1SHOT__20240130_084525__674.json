Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Check if the list is not empty\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        # Determine the temperature trend based on whether daily temperatures were increasing or decreasing\n        if max_temp > min_temp\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif max_temp < min_temp\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n        \n        return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function takes a list of daily temperature data as input. If the list is empty, it returns named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average (`avg`), maximum (`max`), and minimum (`min`) temperatures from the list, then determines the trend based on whether daily temperatures were increasing or decreasing (returns `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable` as appropriate). \n\nPlease note that the function does not account for situations where maximum temperature is equal to minimum temperature. This would need additional logic to handle such cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,345],"elapsed":2.972528758,"_type":"aimessage"}]
