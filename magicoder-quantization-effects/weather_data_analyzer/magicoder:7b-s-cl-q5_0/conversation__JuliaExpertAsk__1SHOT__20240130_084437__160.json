Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an implementation of your requirements using Julia's built-in functionality. Note that the `Statistics` package has been included in the standard library since Julia 1.0.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics: mean, extrema, maximum, minimum, std\n\nWeatherDataResults = NamedTuple{(:average, :max, :min, :trend)}\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        extrema_vals = extrema(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(extrema_vals)\n        min_temp = minimum(extrema_vals)\n        \n        trend = ifelse(avg > max_temp, :increasing, \n                       avg < min_temp ? :decreasing : :stable)\n\n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first checking if the input `temps` array is empty. If it is, then we construct a named tuple with all values set to nothing and return this immediately. \n\nIf not, we compute the mean (`avg`), maximum and minimum temperatures using `mean`, `extrema`, and `maximum` functions respectively. We also calculate the trend using an if-else statement which returns `:increasing` if the average is greater than all temps, `:decreasing` if it's less than all temps, otherwise `:stable`.\n\nFinally, we construct a named tuple with these computed values and return it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,402],"elapsed":3.483869731,"_type":"aimessage"}]
