Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use the Statistics package in Julia to perform statistical operations on your data. Here is how you might define a `weather_data_analyzer` function that fits your description:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Return if list of temps is empty\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    # Compute the average and extremes\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Determine the trend (assuming we have at least 2 temperature readings)\n    if length(temps) >= 2\n        trend = temps[1] < temps[2] ? :increasing : :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    # Return results in a named tuple\n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first checking if the list of temperatures is empty. If it is, it returns all `nothing` values for `average`, `max`, and `min`. Then, it computes the average temperature using the mean function from the Statistics package. It also finds the maximum and minimum temperatures in the list. The trend is determined based on whether the first two readings have increasing or decreasing order.\n\nLet's test this function with your example data:\n\n```julia\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n```\n\nThis should return a named tuple with `average=24.4`, `max=27`, `min=20`, and `trend=:increasing`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,439],"elapsed":5.099119909,"_type":"aimessage"}]
