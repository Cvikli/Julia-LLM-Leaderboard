Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can approach this problem using Julia programming language:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nstruct WeatherDataAnalysisResults <: NamedTuple\n    average::Union{Float64, Nothing}\n    min::Union{Int, Nothing}\n    max::Union{Int, Nothing}\n    trend::Union{Symbol, Nothing}\nend\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return WeatherDataAnalysisResults(nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        minTemp = minimum(temps)\n        maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n        \n        # Determine the trend of temperature data\n        if avg > first(temps)\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif avg < last(temps)\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n\n        return WeatherDataAnalysisResults(avg, minTemp, maxTemp, trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThe function `weather_data_analyzer` first checks if the input list is empty or not. If it's empty then it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. Otherwise, it calculates average, minimum and maximum temperatures of the given data, and determines its trend using simple comparison of average temperature and the first and last values of the data. The trend is determined as `:increasing`, `:decreasing` or `:stable`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,348],"elapsed":4.01684938,"_type":"aimessage"}]
