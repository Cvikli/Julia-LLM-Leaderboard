Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can implement this in Julia. Firstly, ensure the Statistics package is added to your environment. If it isnâ€™t installed yet, use the Pkg add statement as follows: `Pkg.add(\"Statistics\")`\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    trend_symbol = ifelse(min_temp == max_temp, :stable, ifelse(max_temp - min_temp > 0, :increasing, :decreasing))\n    \n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend_symbol)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first checking if the list is empty. If it is, a tuple with all values set to `nothing` is returned.\nIf the list is not empty, then we calculate the mean (average), minimum, and maximum temperatures. Then we use the if-elseif-else construct to determine the trend symbol based on whether the min and max temps are equal, or whether the max temp is greater than the min temp. The function finally returns a named tuple with these values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,323],"elapsed":3.675898238,"_type":"aimessage"}]
