This solution assumes that there will not be any missing data points.\n\nFirstly, include necessary package by adding the following line at the beginning of your code:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n```\n\nNow let's define a function `weather_data_analyzer` which will perform statistical analyses on daily temperature data as mentioned in the problem. Here is an example of how you can implement it:\n\n```julia\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0   # if list is empty, return a tuple with all values set to nothing\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)  # compute the average temperature\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)  # compute the maximum temperature\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)  # compute the minimum temperature\n    \n    if average > max_temp   # check trend based on average and max temperatures\n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif average < min_temp\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)  # return results in named tuple\nend\n```\nYou can test this function using some example data as follows:\n\n```julia\ntemps = [24.5, 30.1, 29.6, 28.7, 30.6, 29.2]\nprintln(weather_data_analyzer(temps))\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,396],"elapsed":4.45364159,"_type":"aimessage"}]
