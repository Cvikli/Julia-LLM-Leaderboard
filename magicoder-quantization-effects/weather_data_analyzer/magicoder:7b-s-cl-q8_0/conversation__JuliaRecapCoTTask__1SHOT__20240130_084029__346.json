[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example solution written in Julia. We first import the necessary package, Statistics, then we define our function weather_data_analyzer:\n```julia\nusing Statistics  # Importing the statistics package for statistical functions\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps) \n    if isempty(temps) \n        return (average = nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing) \n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)  # Calculating average temperature\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)  # Finding the minimum temperature in list\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)  # Finding the maximum temperature in list\n\n        if avg > max_temp || avg < min_temp   # If average is not between max and min, weather trend is either increasing or decreasing\n            trend = (avg - min_temp >= max_temp - avg) ? :increasing : :decreasing\n        else  # If average is in between max and min, weather trend is stable\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n        \n        return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)   # Returning a named tuple with the results\n    end\nend\n``` \nThis function checks if the list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. If not, it calculates the average, minimum and maximum temperature from the provided list of daily temperatures. It then determines whether the weather trend is increasing, decreasing or stable based on the average temperature compared to the minimum and maximum temperatures in the data set. Finally, it returns a named tuple with these results. \n\nYou can call this function with your daily temperature data as follows:\n```julia\ntemps = [23, 19, 25, 28, 20]   # example of daily temperatures\nweather_data_analyzer(temps) \n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,453],"elapsed":5.253238434,"_type":"aimessage"}]
