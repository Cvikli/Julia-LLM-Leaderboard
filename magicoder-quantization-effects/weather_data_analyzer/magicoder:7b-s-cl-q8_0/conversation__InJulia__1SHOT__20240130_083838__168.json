Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package).

If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution in Julia. Note that this will require you to install and import the Statistics package before running it:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        average = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        # Determine the trend based on if the average temperature is greater than or less than \n        # both the maximum and minimum temperatures.\n        trend = :increasing\n        for temp in temps\n            if temp > max_temp || temp < min_temp\n                trend = :decreasing\n                break\n            end\n        end\n        \n        return (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the `temps` array is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\nIf `temps` is not empty, it calculates the mean (`average`), maximum (`max_temp`), and minimum (`min_temp`) of the array. It then checks each temperature in the array to see if it is higher than `max_temp` or lower than `min_temp`, setting `trend` appropriately.\n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple with the results.","status":200,"tokens":[0,346],"elapsed":3.90600118,"_type":"aimessage"}]
