Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can write this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics # Import package for statistics operations\n\nstruct WeatherDataAnalysisResult <: NamedTuple \n    average::Union{Float64, Nothing}\n    max::Union{Float64, Nothing}\n    min::Union{Float64, Nothing}\n    trend::Union{Symbol, Nothing}\nend\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Check if the list is empty\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return WeatherDataAnalysisResult(nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing)\n    end\n\n    # Calculate statistics and trend\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if average > first(temps)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif average < first(temps)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else \n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return WeatherDataAnalysisResult(average, max_temp, min_temp, trend)\nend\n```\nThis function will calculate the mean, maximum and minimum temperature values from your list of daily temperatures. It will also determine the trend based on whether the average is greater than or less than the first value in the list (assuming that the first day's temperature was known to be the lowest). If the list is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set as `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,344],"elapsed":3.867214928,"_type":"aimessage"}]
