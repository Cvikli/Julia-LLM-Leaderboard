Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia solution for your problem:\n\nFirst, let's install the `Statistics` package if it's not already installed. You can do that by running this in your REPL:\n\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"Statistics\")\n```\n\nThen define your function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        # Determine the weather trend based on the difference between consecutive temperatures.\n        if length(temps) < 2 || temps[1] >= temps[2]\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif temps[1] <= temps[2]\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n        \n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function takes a list of temperatures as input. If the list is empty, it returns a named tuple with `nothing` for all values. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperature and determines the trend based on whether consecutive daily temperatures are increasing or decreasing.","status":200,"tokens":[0,340],"elapsed":3.812498338,"_type":"aimessage"}]
