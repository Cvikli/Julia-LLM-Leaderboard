The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`).

The solution assumes that you have already added the Statistics package to your environment. \n\n```julia\nusing Statistics: mean, maximum, minimum\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n        trend = ifelse(max_temp > min_temp, :increasing, \n                      ifelse(max_temp < min_temp, :decreasing, :stable))\n\n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks whether the input list `temps` is empty. If it's not, computes the average (`mean`), maximum (`maximum`) and minimum (`minimum`) temperatures from the data and determines the temperature trend (`:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). \n\nThen it returns a named tuple with all these computed values. If the input list `temps` is empty, then it returns a named tuple where all values are set to `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,305],"elapsed":3.437839413,"_type":"aimessage"}]
