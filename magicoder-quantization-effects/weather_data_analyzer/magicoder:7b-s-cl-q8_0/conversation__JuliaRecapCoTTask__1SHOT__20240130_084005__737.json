[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you can solve this problem. Firstly, install the necessary package with `Pkg.add(\"Statistics\")` and then:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics  # Import the Statistics module\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps) # Check if the list of temperatures is empty\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing) \n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)   # Calculate the average temperature\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)   # Find the minimum temperature\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)   # Find the maximum temperature\n        \n        if isapprox(avg, min_temp; atol=0.5) # Check for increasing trend with a tolerance of 0.5 degree Celsius\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif isapprox(avg, max_temp; atol=0.5) # Check for decreasing trend with a tolerance of 0.5 degree Celsius\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n        \n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend)   # Return named tuple with the results\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we first check if the `temps` list is empty. If it is, we return a named tuple with all values set to nothing. Otherwise, we calculate the average, minimum and maximum temperatures using `mean()`, `minimum()` and `maximum()` functions respectively from Statistics module. We then use `isapprox()` function along with a tolerance of 0.5 degree Celsius to determine the trend. If the average temperature is close to the minimum temperature (increasing), it sets `:increasing` as the trend, if it's close to the maximum temperature (decreasing), then it sets `:decreasing`, otherwise, it sets `:stable`. Finally we return a named tuple with our results.\n\nThe `{{instructions}}` part can be replaced with any instructions from user. These instructions will be specific to their task or problem which you'll have to understand and implement in the function.","status":200,"tokens":[11,510],"elapsed":5.889423688,"_type":"aimessage"}]
