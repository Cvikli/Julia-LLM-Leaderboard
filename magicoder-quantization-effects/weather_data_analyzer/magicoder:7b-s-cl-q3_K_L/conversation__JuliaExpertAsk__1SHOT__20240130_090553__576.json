Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can define such a function in Julia.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics: mean, max, min\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Check if the list is empty\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    # Compute the statistics\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if temps[1] < temps[2] \n        trend = :increasing \n    elseif temps[1] > temps[2] \n        trend = :decreasing\n    else \n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    # Return the named tuple\n    return (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes in a list of temperatures as input and calculates the average, maximum, minimum values from the given temperature data. It also checks if the first two elements of the list are increasing or decreasing and determines a trend based on this comparison. If the list is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,296],"elapsed":2.383922603,"_type":"aimessage"}]
