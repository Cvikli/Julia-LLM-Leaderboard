Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can achieve this using Julia's built-in functionalities:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n    minTemp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    trend_str = ifelse((maxTemp - minTemp) > 0, \":increasing\", ifelse((maxTemp - minTemp) < 0, \":decreasing\", \":stable\"))\n    return (; average=average, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend_str)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks whether the given list is empty. If it is, then a named tuple with all values set to `nothing` is returned. If not, the function calculates the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` temperatures, then determines the trend based on the difference between these three values (if it's positive, the trend is increasing; if negative, it's decreasing; otherwise, it's stable). Finally, a named tuple containing these computed values is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,290],"elapsed":2.330820587,"_type":"aimessage"}]
