Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem using Julia programming language by following these steps. In the below code, we are importing the Statistics package and defining a function \"weather_data_analyzer\" which calculates and returns the average, max, min temperatures as well as trend of given daily temperature data in a named tuple. \n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n    minTemp = minimum(temps)\n    trend = ifelse(maxTemp > minTemp, :increasing, \n                   ifelse(minTemp > maxTemp, :decreasing, :stable))\n    \n    return (average=avg, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function takes a list of daily temperatures as an argument and checks whether the list is empty. If it is, the function returns named tuple with all values set to nothing. Otherwise, it calculates average, maximum and minimum temperature from the provided data and determines the trend based on these values (increasing if maximum temperature > minimum, decreasing otherwise). Finally, the function returns a named tuple containing these calculated statistics.","status":200,"tokens":[0,312],"elapsed":2.52766418,"_type":"aimessage"}]
