Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is a Julia solution for your problem. This solution uses the statistics package to calculate the average, max, and min of the temperatures and then determines the trend based on consecutive differences:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    trend = if length(temps) < 2\n        nothing\n    elseif diff([first(temps); temps]) == fill(0, length(temps)-1)\n        :stable\n    elseif diff([first(temps); temps]) > 0\n        :increasing\n    else\n        :decreasing\n    end\n    \n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first checking if the input list of temperatures is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperature from the input data. It then determines the trend based on whether the consecutive differences are strictly positive, negative or zero.\n\nYou can use this function by calling `weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])` as per your example data.","status":200,"tokens":[0,355],"elapsed":2.929086245,"_type":"aimessage"}]
