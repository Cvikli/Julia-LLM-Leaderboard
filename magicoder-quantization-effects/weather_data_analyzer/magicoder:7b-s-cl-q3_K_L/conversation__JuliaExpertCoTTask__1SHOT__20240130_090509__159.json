Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's one way you could solve this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    min, max = extrema(temps)\n    \n    if diff([min,max]) > 0\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif diff([min,max]) < 0\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=max, min=min, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function works by first checking if the input list `temps` is empty. If it's not empty, it calculates the mean (`avg`), minimum (`min`) and maximum (`max`) values of the input list using Julia's built-in functions for these computations.\n\nIt then checks whether the difference between the minimum and maximum temperatures in the list is greater than 0 (indicating an increasing trend), less than 0 (an decreasing trend) or equal to 0 (a stable trend). This is done using Julia's `diff` function, which computes differences along specified dimensions of arrays.\n\nThe function finally returns these calculated values packaged into a named tuple. If the input list was empty, the function returns all fields set to `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[323,347],"elapsed":4.217710604,"_type":"aimessage"}]
