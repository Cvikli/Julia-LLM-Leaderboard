Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n    minTemp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if diff([avg, minTemp]) < 0\n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif diff([maxTemp, avg]) > 0\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the `temps` list is empty. If it's empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. If not, it computes the average, maximum and minimum temperatures of the data using Julia's built-in functions from the Statistics package. Then, it uses conditional statements to determine whether the trend in temperature is increasing, decreasing or stable by comparing the computed averages with the minimums and maximums respectively. Finally, it constructs a named tuple containing the calculated statistics and the determined trend, which is returned as the result of the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,302],"elapsed":2.437476263,"_type":"aimessage"}]
