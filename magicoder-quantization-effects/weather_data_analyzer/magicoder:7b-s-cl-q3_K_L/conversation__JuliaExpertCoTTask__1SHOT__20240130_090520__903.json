Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a solution in Julia using the Statistics package. Note that this code assumes you have already added the Statistics package to your environment by running `Pkg.add(\"Statistics\")` before running this script. Also note that this solution does not take into account cases where the data has missing values and these are treated as if they were no data present at all, which could be problematic.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    isempty(temps) && return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max = maximum(temps)\n    min = minimum(temps)\n    diffs = diff(temps)\n    if all(x -> x > 0, diffs), return (; average=avg, max=max, min=min, trend=:increasing)\n    elseif all(x -> x < 0, diffs), return (; average=avg, max=max, min=min, trend=:decreasing)\n    else, return (; average=avg, max=max, min=min, trend=:stable)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the mean and maximum/minimum temperature, and then uses the diff function to calculate the differences between consecutive elements in the list. Based on these differences, it determines whether the trend is increasing, decreasing or stable.\n\nYou can call this function with your example data like this:\n```julia\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n```\nThis should return a named tuple containing the average temperature (`avg`), maximum temperature (`max`), minimum temperature (`min`), and trend (`trend`). The `diffs` line is used to get the differences between consecutive elements in the list.","status":200,"tokens":[0,456],"elapsed":3.75299542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
