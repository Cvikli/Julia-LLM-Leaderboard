Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could implement this in Julia. \n\n```julia\nusing Statistics: mean, max, min\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        # Determine the trend based on the difference between average and max/min\n        if avg > max_temp\n            trend = :decreasing\n        elseif avg < min_temp\n            trend = :increasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n        \n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function takes as input a list of daily temperature data `temps`. If the list is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing` (indicating that there's no data). Otherwise, it calculates the average (`avg`), maximum (`max_temp`) and minimum (`min_temp`) temperatures. It then determines the trend based on whether the average is greater than or less than the maximum or minimum temperature, respectively. \n\nThe function finally returns a named tuple with these calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,326],"elapsed":2.46304856,"_type":"aimessage"}]
