Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could write this function in Julia. This code uses the Statistics package for basic statistical operations and NamedTuple for constructing the output:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if avg > max_temp\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif avg < min_temp\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf the list isn't empty, it calculates the average (`avg`), maximum (`max_temp`) and minimum (`min_temp`) temperatures using the `mean` and `extrema` functions from the Statistics package. \n\nThen, it checks if the average is greater than or equal to the maximum temperature. If it is, the trend is set to `:increasing`. If not, it then checks if the average is less than or equal to the minimum temperature. If that's true, the trend is set to `:decreasing`. Otherwise, the trend is set to `:stable`. \n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple containing the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,387],"elapsed":2.875411633,"_type":"aimessage"}]
