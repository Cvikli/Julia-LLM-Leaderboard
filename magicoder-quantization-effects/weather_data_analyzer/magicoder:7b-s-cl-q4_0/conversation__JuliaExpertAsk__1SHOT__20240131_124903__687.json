Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia solution for your problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (;average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    if avg > max_temp\n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif avg < min_temp\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (;average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty. If it's empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. If not, it calculates the average (`avg`), maximum (`max_temp`) and minimum temperature (`min_temp` of the list) using Julia's built-in functions from the `Statistics` package. \n\nThen, based on these calculated values, it determines the trend (either `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the average is greater than the maximum, then the temperature is decreasing. If the average is lesser than the minimum, then the temperature is increasing. Otherwise, if none of these conditions are satisfied, it means that the trend is stable. \n\nFinally, it constructs and returns a named tuple with all the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,365],"elapsed":2.767977415,"_type":"aimessage"}]
