This code assumes that the input list is sorted from earliest to latest date:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n    minTemp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if temps[1] < temps[2]  # temperature started to increase from the second day\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif temps[1] > temps[2]   # temperature started to decrease from the second day\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else  # temperature is stable for the first two days\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (;average=average, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function starts by checking if the input list `temps` is empty. If it is, a named tuple with all values set to `nothing` is returned. \n\nIf not, it calculates the mean (average), maximum and minimum temperatures using `mean()`, `maximum()` and `minimum()` functions from the `Statistics.jl` package respectively. Then, it checks if the first two elements of the list are in increasing or decreasing order to determine the trend.\n\nFinally, it constructs and returns a named tuple with these calculated values. The trend is denoted as `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,382],"elapsed":2.908888376,"_type":"aimessage"}]
