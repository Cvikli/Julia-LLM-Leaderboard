Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem in Julia. The function `weather_data_analyzer` calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures from the input list `temps`, determines if the trend is increasing, decreasing or stable based on the difference between consecutive days' temperatures, and returns these values along with a named tuple.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics: mean, extrema, first, last\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0 # If temps is empty\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp, min_temp = extrema(temps)\n    \n    if first(temps) < last(temps) # Temperature is increasing\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif first(temps) > last(temps) # Temperature is decreasing\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else # Temperature is stable\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list of temperatures is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures from the input list `temps`, determines the trend based on the difference between consecutive days' temperatures (increasing if first day < last day, decreasing if first day > last day, stable otherwise), and returns these values along with a named tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,385],"elapsed":2.920546144,"_type":"aimessage"}]
