Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package).

If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia. We will use the Statistics package for calculating mean and extrema of the data, and we will use the DifferentialEquations package for determining the trend.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\nusing DifferentialEquations\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    function f(du, u, p, t) \n        du[1] = u[2] - u[1]\n    end\n    \n    prob = ODEProblem((u,p,t)->f(u), [0.0, max_temp], (0.0, 1.0))\n    sol = solve(prob, Tsit5(), abstol=1e-14, reltol=1e-14)\n    \n    if sol.u[end] > 0\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif sol.u[end] < 0\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list of temperatures is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf the list is not empty, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperature using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the Statistics package. It then uses the DifferentialEquations package to solve an ordinary differential equation (ODE) that models a trend in the data. The function returns a named tuple with the calculated values.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the trend is linear, which might not be accurate for all types of data. If you need to handle non-linear trends or other types of data, you may need to adjust this solution accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,498],"elapsed":3.727959743,"_type":"aimessage"}]
