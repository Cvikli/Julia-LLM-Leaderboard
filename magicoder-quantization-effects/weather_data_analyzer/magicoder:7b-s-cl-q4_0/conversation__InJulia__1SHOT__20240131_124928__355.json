Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could implement this in Julia. \n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    maximum = maximum(temps)\n    minimum = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if avg > maximum\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif avg < minimum\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=maximum, min=minimum, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function works by first checking if the list of temperatures is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf the list isn't empty, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package respectively. It then checks if the average is greater than, less than or equal to the maximum and minimum values, and sets the trend accordingly.\n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple containing these calculated values, along with the trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,307],"elapsed":2.315966148,"_type":"aimessage"}]
