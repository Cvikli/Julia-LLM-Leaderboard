Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia. \n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        trend = nothing\n    elseif all(temps[2:end] .> temps[1])\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(temps[2:end] .< temps[1])\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; \n        average=mean(temps),\n        max=maximum(temps),\n        min=minimum(temps),\n        trend=trend,\n    )\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first checking if the list is empty. If it is, it sets `trend` to `nothing`. \n\nIf the list isn't empty, it checks whether all temperatures in the list are greater than or lesser than the first one. If they are, then `trend` is set to `:increasing` or `:decreasing`, respectively. If they aren't, then `trend` is set to `:stable`. \n\nFinally, it constructs and returns a named tuple with fields for `average`, `max`, `min`, and `trend`. It uses the `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax for construction.","status":200,"tokens":[0,319],"elapsed":2.453123863,"_type":"aimessage"}]
