Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use Julia's built-in package `Statistics` for this task. The `Statistics` package includes functions such as `mean()`, `max()`, and `min()`. Here is how you could define your function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        average = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if average > max_temp \n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif average < min_temp \n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n\n        return (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list of temperatures is empty. If it's not empty, it calculates the average temperature, maximum and minimum temperature using `mean()`, `maximum()` and `minimum()` functions respectively. It then compares these values to determine whether the trend is increasing, decreasing or stable. Finally, it constructs a named tuple with calculated results and returns it. If the list is empty, function returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing.","status":200,"tokens":[0,319],"elapsed":2.409910324,"_type":"aimessage"}]
