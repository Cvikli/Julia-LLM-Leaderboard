[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers).

It first checks if the list is empty or not and returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing in case it is. \n\nIf the list is not empty, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures using `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the Statistics package respectively. Then, based on the difference between successive temperatures, it determines whether the trend is `:increasing`, `:decreasing` or `:stable`. Finally, it returns a named tuple with the calculated statistics and trend.\n\nPlease replace {{instructions}} with your special instructions if there are any.","status":200,"tokens":[0,451],"elapsed":3.55240591,"_type":"aimessage"}]
