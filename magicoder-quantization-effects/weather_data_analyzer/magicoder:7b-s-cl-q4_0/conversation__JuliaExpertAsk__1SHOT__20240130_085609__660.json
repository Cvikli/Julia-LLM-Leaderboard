Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a solution written in Julia. It uses the `Statistics` package to calculate the mean and extrema of the data, then checks if the trend is increasing, decreasing or stable by comparing the first two elements of the list:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    avg = isnan(mean(temps)) ? nothing : mean(temps)\n    minT = minimum(temps)\n    maxT = maximum(temps)\n    \n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (;average=nothing,max=nothing,min=nothing,trend=nothing)\n    elseif temps[1] < temps[2]\n        return (; average=avg, max=maxT, min=minT, trend=:decreasing)\n    elseif temps[1] > temps[2]\n        return (; average=avg, max=maxT, min=minT, trend=:increasing)\n    else \n        return (; average=avg, max=maxT, min=minT, trend=:stable)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function works as follows: if the list `temps` is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. If not, it calculates the mean and extreme values of the data, then checks if the list is increasing, decreasing or stable by comparing the first two elements. Depending on this check, it returns a named tuple with the calculated average, max, min temperatures and trend. \n\nPlease make sure that you have installed the `Statistics` package in your Julia environment to use the function. If not, you can install it using Pkg.add(\"Statistics\").","status":200,"tokens":[0,391],"elapsed":3.008031103,"_type":"aimessage"}]
