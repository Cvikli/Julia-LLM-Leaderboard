Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an implementation in Julia. The Statistics package provides the functionality we need for this task. It also includes functions like `mean` and `extrema` which are used here.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics: mean, extrema\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        extreme_vals = extrema(temps)\n        min_temp, max_temp = extreme_vals[1][1], extreme_vals[2][1]\n\n        if (max_temp - avg) > 0 && (avg - min_temp) >= 0\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif (avg - max_temp) <= 0 && (avg - min_temp) < 0\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n\n        return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty. If it is, then a named tuple with all values set to `nothing` is returned. \nIf the list has elements, then we calculate the average and extrema of the temperatures. We use the `extrema` function from Statistics package to find both minimum and maximum temperature values. Depending on these calculated values, we determine the trend as either `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`. \nThe result is returned as a named tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,383],"elapsed":2.956085381,"_type":"aimessage"}]
