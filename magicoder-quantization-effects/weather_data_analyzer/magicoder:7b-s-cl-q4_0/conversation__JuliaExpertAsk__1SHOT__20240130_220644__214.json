Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an implementation of your task in Julia. This solution uses the Statistics package for calculating average, max and min temperatures:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if average > max_temp\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif average < min_temp\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the `temps` list is empty. If it's not, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the Statistics package. It then determines the trend based on whether the average temperature is greater than or less than the maximum or minimum temperature respectively. Finally, it returns a named tuple with the calculated values. If the list is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,304],"elapsed":2.259214122,"_type":"aimessage"}]
