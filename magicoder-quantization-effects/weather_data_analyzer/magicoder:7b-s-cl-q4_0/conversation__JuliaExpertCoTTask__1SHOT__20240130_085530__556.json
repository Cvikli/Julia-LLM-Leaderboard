Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure. First we need to install the Statistics package if it's not installed yet. Run this in Julia: `]add Statistics`. Here is your solution for the problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    n = length(temps)\n    trend = nothing\n\n    # If list is empty, return named tuple with all values set to nothing\n    if n == 0\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Check trend\n    if avg_temp > max_temp \n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif avg_temp < min_temp\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    (average=avg_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nYou can call the function with some data like this: `weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])`.\n\nPlease note that the \"trend\" is determined based on the average temperature. If the average temp is greater than max temp then the trend is increasing, if it's lesser then it's decreasing and if it equals both max and min then it's stable. This may not be a perfect approach for determining the weather trends but it gives an idea about how you could start solving this problem in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[0,382],"elapsed":2.919894142,"_type":"aimessage"}]
