Please note that it assumes that the `Statistics` package has been loaded and the `temps` data has been provided:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if max_temp > avg_temp && max_temp - min_temp >= 2.0\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif min_temp < avg_temp && max_temp - min_temp <= -2.0\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (average = avg_temp, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the provided list of temperatures is empty. If it is, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf the list isn't empty, the function calculates the average (`avg_temp`), maximum (`max_temp`) and minimum temperature (`min_temp`). Then based on this data, the function determines if the trend of temperatures is increasing, decreasing or stable. \n\nThe named tuple `(average = avg_temp, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = trend)` is returned as a result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,377],"elapsed":2.884581535,"_type":"aimessage"}]
