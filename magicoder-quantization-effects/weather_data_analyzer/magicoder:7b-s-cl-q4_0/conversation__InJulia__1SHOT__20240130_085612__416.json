Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem using Julia. Note that we use `Statistics` package for mean, max and min calculations. The trend is determined by checking if the difference between successive elements in the list is positive or negative. If it's increasing then `:increasing`, if decreasing then `:decreasing`. For stable trends, we check for no change in temperature levels within a certain degree (here 2 degrees).\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        average = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        # Determine the trend.\n        if length(temps) < 2\n            return (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:stable)\n        end\n\n        diffs = [temps[i+1] - temps[i] for i in 1:(length(temps)-1)]\n        \n        if all(d -> d <= 2, diffs) || all(d -> d >= -2, diffs)\n            return (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:stable)\n        elseif sum([diff > 0 for diff in diffs]) == length(temps)-1 # If the temps are all increasing.\n            return (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:increasing)\n        elseif sum([diff < 0 for diff in diffs]) == length(temps)-1 # If the temps are all decreasing.\n            return (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:decreasing)\n        end\n    end\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[154,449],"elapsed":3.484736226,"_type":"aimessage"}]
