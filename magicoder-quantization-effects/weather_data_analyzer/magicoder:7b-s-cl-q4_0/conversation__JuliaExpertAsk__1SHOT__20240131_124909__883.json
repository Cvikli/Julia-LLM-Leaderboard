Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could write this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if avg > max_temp\n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:decreasing)\n    elseif avg < min_temp\n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:increasing)\n    else\n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:stable)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the `temps` list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf the list is not empty, it calculates the average (`avg`), maximum (`max_temp`) and minimum (`min_temp`) temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package. \n\nThen it checks if the average temperature is greater than or less than the maximum or minimum temperature, respectively. If so, it returns a named tuple with the calculated values and the trend set to `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,363],"elapsed":2.754510804,"_type":"aimessage"}]
