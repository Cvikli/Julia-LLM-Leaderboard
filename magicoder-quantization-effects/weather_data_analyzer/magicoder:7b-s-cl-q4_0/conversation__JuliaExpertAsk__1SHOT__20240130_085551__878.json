Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you might implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nstruct WeatherDataAnalysis <: NamedTuple\n    average::Union{Nothing, Float64}  # Average temperature.\n    max::Union{Nothing, Float64}       # Maximum daily temperature.\n    min::Union{Nothing, Float64}       # Minimum daily temperature.\n    trend::Union{Nothing, Symbol}      # Trend in daily temperature: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`.\nend\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)::WeatherDataAnalysis\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return WeatherDataAnalysis(nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    trend = nothing\n    if average > 0.0 && max_temp > 0.0 && min_temp > 0.0\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif average < 0.0 && max_temp < 0.0 && min_temp < 0.0\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return WeatherDataAnalysis(average, max_temp, min_temp, trend)\nend\n```\nThis function works by first checking if the list of temperatures is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average and maximum temperature, and then determines the trend based on these values. The trend is determined as follows: if the average, maximum, and minimum temperature are all positive, the trend is `:increasing`. If they're all negative, the trend is `:decreasing`. Otherwise (which should only be true in a stable weather situation), the trend is `:stable`. The named tuple is then returned with these values.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n```julia\ntemps = [23.5, 26.7, 23.8, 24.9, 26.0, 23.1]\ndata_analysis = weather_data_analyzer(temps)\nprintln(data_analysis)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,532],"elapsed":4.146951242,"_type":"aimessage"}]
