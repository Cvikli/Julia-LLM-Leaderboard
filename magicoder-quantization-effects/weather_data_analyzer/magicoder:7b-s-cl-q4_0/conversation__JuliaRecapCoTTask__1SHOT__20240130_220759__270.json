X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`).

This solution uses the Statistics package for calculating average and trend, and Base for handling the named tuple and list manipulations. \n\n```julia\nusing Statistics: mean, minimum, maximum\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        \n        if avg > max_temp\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif avg < min_temp\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else \n            trend = :stable\n        end\n\n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we first check if the list of temps is empty. If it is, we return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, we calculate the average (`avg`), minimum (`min_temp`) and maximum (`max_temp`) temperatures using the `mean`, `minimum` and `maximum` functions from the Statistics package respectively. \n\nWe then determine the `trend` of the data based on whether the average is greater than, less than or equal to the max/min temperature. We return a named tuple with these calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,344],"elapsed":2.636637455,"_type":"aimessage"}]
