Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you might solve this problem in Julia. This solution uses the Statistics package for calculating statistical properties and the DataStructures package for creating a named tuple:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics, DataStructures\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    if avg > max_temp || avg < min_temp\n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:increasing)\n    elseif avg < max_temp && avg > min_temp\n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:decreasing)\n    else\n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:stable)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf the list isn't empty, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the Statistics package respectively. It then checks if the average temperature is greater than or lesser than either of the max/min temperatures. If it is, it returns a named tuple with the appropriate trend `:increasing` or `:decreasing`. \n\nIf none of these conditions are met, it means that the average temperature is neither increasing nor decreasing and so it sets the trend to `:stable`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,413],"elapsed":3.083352479,"_type":"aimessage"}]
