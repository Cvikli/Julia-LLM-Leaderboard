Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an implementation of the `weather_data_analyzer` function in Julia. This function uses the `Statistics` package for calculating mean and extrema (maximum and minimum) from the input list, and checks if the trend is increasing, decreasing or stable.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    if avg > max_temp\n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif avg < min_temp\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function works as follows: if the list of temperatures is empty, it returns a named tuple with `nothing` values for all fields. If not, it calculates the mean and extrema (maximum and minimum) using the `mean` and `extrema` functions from the `Statistics` package, then checks the trend by comparing the average temperature to the maximum and minimum temperatures. It returns a named tuple with the calculated values and the determined trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,333],"elapsed":2.520085049,"_type":"aimessage"}]
