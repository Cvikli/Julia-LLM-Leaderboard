Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can define such a function in Julia. We'll use the Statistics package from the Standard Library:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics: mean, maximum, minimum\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        average = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        # Determine the trend of temperature data.\n        if average > max_temp\n            trend = :decreasing\n        elseif average < min_temp\n            trend = :increasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n        \n        return (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function works by first checking if the `temps` array is empty. If it is, it constructs and returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. If the array isn't empty, it calculates the average, maximum, minimum temperatures using the Statistics package and determines the trend of the temperature data by comparing the average with the maximum and minimum temperatures. Finally, it constructs and returns the named tuple containing these calculated values along with the determined trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,316],"elapsed":2.40985057,"_type":"aimessage"}]
