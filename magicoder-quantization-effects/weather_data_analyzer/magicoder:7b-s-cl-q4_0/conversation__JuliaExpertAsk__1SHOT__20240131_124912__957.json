Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia solution for your problem. I will use the Statistics package along with NamedTuple from Base. The function weather_data_analyzer takes as input an array of daily temperature data and returns a named tuple containing the average, max, min temperatures and trend based on the provided list.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if avg > max_temp \n        return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:decreasing)\n    elseif avg < min_temp \n        return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:increasing)\n    else\n        return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:stable)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty. If it's empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. If not, it calculates the mean (average), maximum and minimum temperatures of the data and determines the trend based on whether the average temperature is greater than or less than either the max or min temperature. It then constructs and returns the named tuple containing these calculated statistics.","status":200,"tokens":[0,359],"elapsed":2.717098764,"_type":"aimessage"}]
