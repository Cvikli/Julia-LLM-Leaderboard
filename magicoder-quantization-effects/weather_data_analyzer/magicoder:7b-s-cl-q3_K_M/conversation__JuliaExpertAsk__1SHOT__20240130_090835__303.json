Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if average > first(temps)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif average < first(temps)\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list is empty. If it is, a tuple with all values set to `nothing` is returned. Then it calculates the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` from the data using functions from the Statistics package. It uses these results to determine the trend of temperature variation. If the average temperature is greater than the first temperature in the list, the trend is `:decreasing`. If it's less, the trend is `:increasing`. In case the average equals to the first temperature, the trend is `:stable`. \n\nFinally, a named tuple with these calculated values and the determined trend is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,330],"elapsed":2.585617831,"_type":"aimessage"}]
