Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can use the Statistics package which contains functions for basic statistical operations such as mean and extrema. Also, for identifying the trend of data, we need to check if the max and min are in increasing or decreasing order. \n\nHere is how it could be done:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n  \n    if max_temp == min_temp \n        return (average = average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend = :stable)\n    elseif temps[1] < temps[2] && temps[1] < temps[3]\n         return (average = average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend = :decreasing)\n    else \n        return (average = average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend = :increasing)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function calculates the mean, maximum and minimum temperature from `temps` list. Then it checks if these values are in increasing order, decreasing or stable order to determine the trend of the data. If temps list is empty, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing.","status":200,"tokens":[0,342],"elapsed":2.683447042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
