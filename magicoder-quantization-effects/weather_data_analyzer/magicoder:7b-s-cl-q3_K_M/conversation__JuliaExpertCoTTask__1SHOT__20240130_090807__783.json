Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia implementation of your task:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max = maximum(temps)\n    min = minimum(temps)\n    trend_data = diff([minimum(temps); temps; maximum(temps)])\n    trend = :increasing\n\n    for val in trend_data\n        if val < 0\n            trend = :decreasing\n        elseif val == 0\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (average=avg, max=max, min=min, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list of temperatures is empty.

It then creates a list `trend_data` which contains the differences between the consecutive days' temperatures. The trend is then determined by checking each value in this list. If all values are positive or zero (i.e., no daily decrease), it is set to `:stable`. If at least one of the values is negative, it is set to `:decreasing`.\n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple with the average temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,357],"elapsed":2.783655651,"_type":"aimessage"}]
