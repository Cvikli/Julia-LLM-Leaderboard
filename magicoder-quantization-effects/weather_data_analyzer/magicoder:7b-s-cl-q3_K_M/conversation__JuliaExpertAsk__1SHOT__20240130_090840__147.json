Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem using Julia programming language. Here is an example of how you might define such a function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) > 0\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        trend_type = :stable\n        for i in 2:length(temps), j in i+1:length(temps)\n            if temps[i] - temps[j] > 0\n                trend_type = :increasing\n                break\n            elseif temps[i] - temps[j] < 0\n                trend_type = :decreasing\n                break\n        end\n    else\n        avg, max_temp, min_temp, trend_type = nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend_type)\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, if the length of `temps` is greater than 0, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperature. Then, checks the trend by comparing each consecutive pair of temperatures. If the next temp is higher, the trend is set to `:increasing`. If the next temp is lower, the trend is set to `:decreasing`. Otherwise, the trend remains `:stable`.\n\nIf the list is empty, it sets all results to `nothing`. Then returns a named tuple with these results.","status":200,"tokens":[0,361],"elapsed":2.843565083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
