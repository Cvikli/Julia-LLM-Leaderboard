Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can write this in Julia:\n\nFirstly, install the Statistics package via Juliaâ€™s Pkg module by typing `Pkg.add(\"Statistics\")` on your Julia REPL or console. Then, define your function like so:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n        minTemp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if maxTemp == minTemp\n            trend = :stable\n        elseif maxTemp > minTemp\n            trend = :increasing\n        else \n            trend = :decreasing\n        end\n\n        return (average=avg, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nYou can test the function with weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22]) as your input.\n\nThis function first checks if the list `temps` is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. \n\nIf there are temperatures in the list, it calculates the mean (average), maximum and minimum temperatures using Julia's built-in Statistics module. It then determines if there's a trend by checking if the maximum temperature is equal to the minimum temperature or not, and whether the maximum temperature is greater than the minimum or not. \n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple containing these statistical results.","status":200,"tokens":[0,379],"elapsed":2.972943595,"_type":"aimessage"}]
