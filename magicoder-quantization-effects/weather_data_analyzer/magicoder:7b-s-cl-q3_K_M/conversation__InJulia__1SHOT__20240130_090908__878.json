[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you might write such a function. Firstly, install the required package if not installed yet by typing `using Pkg; Pkg.add(\"Statistics\")`, then below is the function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    trend = nothing\n    \n    if length(unique(temps)) == 1\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif first(temps) < last(temps)\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n\n    return (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list is empty. If it's empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\nIf the list is not empty, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperature using functions from the Statistics package. Then based on whether or not the temperatures are increasing, decreasing or staying stable (same value repeating), it sets the trend accordingly. \n\nFinally it returns a named tuple with the computed values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,332],"elapsed":2.594001207,"_type":"aimessage"}]
