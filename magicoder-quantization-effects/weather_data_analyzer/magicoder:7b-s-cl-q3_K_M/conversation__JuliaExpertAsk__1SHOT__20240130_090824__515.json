Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is an example of how you can solve this problem in Julia. This example assumes that we have access to Statistics and DataFrames packages:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics: mean, max, min\nusing NamedTuple: @namedtuple\nusing DataFrames: DataFrame\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n        trend_value = avg - first(temps)\n        if trend_value > 0\n            return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:increasing)\n        elseif trend_value < 0\n            return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:decreasing)\n        else\n            return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:stable)\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\nPlease note that `first(temps)` is used as a reference point to determine the trend. You may want to adjust this depending on your specific data and needs. \n\nYou can test the function with some example data like so:\n```julia\ntemps = [23, 19, 24, 25, 26]\nprint(weather_data_analyzer(temps))\n```\nThe output should be something like: `(average=23.0, max=26, min=19, trend=:increasing)`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,402],"elapsed":3.136766191,"_type":"aimessage"}]
