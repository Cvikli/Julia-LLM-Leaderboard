If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \nIf not, it calculates the average (`avg`), maximum and minimum temperatures. It then determines the trend based on these statistics. In this example, we are only considering an increase or decrease in temperature as indicating an increasing or decreasing trend. If there is no change in temperature levels for the entire period, we classify it as stable.","status":200,"tokens":[0,354],"elapsed":2.710160056,"_type":"aimessage"}]
