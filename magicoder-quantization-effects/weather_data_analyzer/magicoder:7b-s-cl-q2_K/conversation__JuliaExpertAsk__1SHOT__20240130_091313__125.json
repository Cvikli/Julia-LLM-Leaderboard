Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how this function might look in Julia. Note that it's important to check if your data has at least one element before trying to compute statistical measures:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    n = length(temps)\n    isnull = isempty(temps) || (n == 1 && temps[1]==nothing)\n    \n    avg, max_, min_ = nothing, nothing, nothing\n    trend = nothing\n\n    if !isnull\n        avg = isnull ? nothing : mean(temps)\n        max_ = isnull ? nothing : maximum(temps)\n        min_ = isnull ? nothing : minimum(temps)\n        \n        diff = max_-min_\n        trend = if diff > 0\n                    if temps[1] < temps[end] && temps[2] - temps[1] >= diff/2\n                        :decreasing\n                    elseif temps[1] > temps[end] && temps[2] - temps[1] <= diff/2\n                        :increasing\n                    else :stable\n                end \n    end\n    return (; average=avg, max=max_, min=min_, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nNote: `isnull` variable checks if list is empty or first and last elements are nothing, indicating that it's an incomplete data.","status":200,"tokens":[0,323],"elapsed":2.485787092,"_type":"aimessage"}]
