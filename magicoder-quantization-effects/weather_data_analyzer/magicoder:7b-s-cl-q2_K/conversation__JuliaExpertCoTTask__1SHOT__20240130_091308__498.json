Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you can solve this task. We first calculate the average temperature, max and min temperature from the provided list. Then we analyze trends for this data. If the daily temperatures are increasing, decreasing or stable it returns that accordingly. In case the list is empty, we return `nothing` as per the requirement.\n\nHere is a Julia function which accomplishes these tasks:\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n  if isempty(temps)\n    return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n  else\n    average = mean(temps)\n    maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n    minTemp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    temp_diff = [temps[i+1]-temps[i] for i in 1:length(temps)-1]\n    if all(x -> x > 0, temp_diff)\n      trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(x -> x < 0, temp_diff)\n      trend = :decreasing\n    else\n      trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=average, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend)\n  end\nend\n```\n\nYou can call this function with your daily temperature data as follows:\n```julia\ntemps = [25, 27, 23, 20, 22]\nprint(weather_data_analyzer(temps))\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,354],"elapsed":2.725087335,"_type":"aimessage"}]
