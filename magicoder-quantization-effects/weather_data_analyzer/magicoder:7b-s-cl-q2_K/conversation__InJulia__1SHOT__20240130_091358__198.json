Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you might write this function. Note that we will need to use the `Statistics` package for the mean and extrema calculations:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    trend = nothing  # assume stable to start with. Will update based on comparison later.\n\n    if length(temps) > 1\n        delta = max_temp - min_temp\n        \n        if average - temps[1] / delta < 0 \n            trend = :decreasing\n        elseif average - temps[1] / delta > 0\n            trend = :increasing\n        end \n    end\n    \n    return (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the temperature list is empty and returns a named tuple with `nothing` for all values. If there are temperatures in the list, it calculates the average (`mean`), maximum (`maximum`), and minimum (`minimum`) temperatures. Then, it checks the trend by comparing the average temperature to the first temperature in the list. \n\nRemember that we're assuming a stable trend at first (no initial direction established), so if you need to update this for your specific use case, you may want to add additional logic depending on what your data looks like and what you consider an \"increasing\" or \"decreasing\" trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,397],"elapsed":3.021632338,"_type":"aimessage"}]
