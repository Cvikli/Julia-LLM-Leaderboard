If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia code for this problem. This function will take in the daily temperature data and return a named tuple containing the average, max, min temperatures, and a trend based on the statistical analyses performed on it.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics: mean, minimum, maximum\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (;average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    minTemp = minimum(temps)\n    maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n\n    if maxTemp > avg \n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif maxTemp < avg\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=avg, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nIn the above code snippet, we're using the Statistics package which provides functions to perform statistical operations such as mean, minimum and maximum. The function isEmpty checks if the list of temperatures (temps) is empty. If it is, a named tuple with all values set to nothing is returned. Otherwise, the minimum, maximum and average temperature are calculated and then based on these values we determine the trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,306],"elapsed":2.338188316,"_type":"aimessage"}]
