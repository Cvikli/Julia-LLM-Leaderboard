Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia solution for your problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        average = round(mean(temps), digits=2)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if average == max_temp && average == min_temp\n            trend = :stable\n        elseif average < max_temp && average > min_temp\n            trend = :increasing\n        else\n            trend = :decreasing\n        end\n        return (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list of temperatures is empty. If it is, it constructs a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the mean and maximum/minimum temperatures, determines the trend based on these measurements, and finally constructs and returns the named tuple containing these statistics.","status":200,"tokens":[0,267],"elapsed":1.967223842,"_type":"aimessage"}]
