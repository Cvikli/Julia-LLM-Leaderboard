Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can do it in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Check if the list is empty\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if temps[1] < temps[2]  # Temperature increases\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif temps[1] > temps[2]  # Temperature decreases\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else  # Stable temperature\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks whether the data list is empty. If it's empty, it immediately returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. Then, it calculates the mean (`avg`), maximum (`max_temp`), and minimum (`min_temp`) temperatures using the `mean` and `extrema` functions from the Statistics package. It determines whether the temperature increases, decreases, or remains stable by comparing the first two elements of the list (if it's not empty).\nThe function then returns a named tuple with these values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,336],"elapsed":2.59077142,"_type":"aimessage"}]
