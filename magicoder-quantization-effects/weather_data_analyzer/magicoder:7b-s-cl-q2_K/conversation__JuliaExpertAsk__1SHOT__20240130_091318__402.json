Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an implementation of your problem in Julia using the Statistics module.\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n  if isempty(temps)\n    return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n  end\n  \n  average = mean(temps)\n  maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n  minTemp = minimum(temps)\n  \n  if average < first(temps)\n      trend = :decreasing\n  elseif average > first(temps)\n    trend = :increasing\n  else\n    trend = :stable\n  end\n    \n  return (average=average, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nIn this function, if the `temps` array is empty, we immediately return a named tuple with all values set to nothing. Otherwise, we calculate the mean and maximum/minimum temperatures using the Statistics module's functions `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum`. We also check the trend of temperature by comparing the average to the first value in the list. If it is less than the first value, the trend is decreasing; if it's greater, it's increasing. Else it's stable.\n\nWe return a named tuple with these calculated values. The function works correctly even when the input data has no elements, as specified in your problem statement.","status":200,"tokens":[0,325],"elapsed":2.490093193,"_type":"aimessage"}]
