Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can do it in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n    minTemp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if avg > first(temps)\n        return (average = avg, max = maxTemp, min = minTemp, trend = :decreasing)\n    elseif avg < last(temps)\n        return (average = avg, max = maxTemp, min = minTemp, trend = :increasing)\n    else \n        return (average = avg, max = maxTemp, min = minTemp, trend = :stable)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function checks if the array is empty and returns a tuple with nothing values if it's true. Then calculates the mean, maximum and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the Statistics package. Lastly, it checks the trend by comparing the average temperature to the first or last value of the list. If the average is greater than the first one, then the trend is considered as decreasing; if the average is less than the last one, the trend is considered as increasing; otherwise (in case the array has at least two elements and the average is between the lowest and highest temperatures), the trend is considered stable.\n\nRemember to include this line in your code: \n`using Statistics` \nto be able to use `mean`, `maximum`, etc functions.","status":200,"tokens":[0,392],"elapsed":3.168145645,"_type":"aimessage"}]
