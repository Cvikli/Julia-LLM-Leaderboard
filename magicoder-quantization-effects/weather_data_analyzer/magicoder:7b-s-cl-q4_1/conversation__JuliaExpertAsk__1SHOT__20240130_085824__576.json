Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    \n    if avg == min_temp\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif avg > min_temp && avg < max_temp\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n\n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list is empty. If it's empty, it returns a tuple with everything set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average temperature (mean of the list), the minimum temperature (minimum of the list), the maximum temperature (maximum of the list). It then determines the `trend` based on whether the average is equal to either the min or max, greater than both, or less than both.\nFinally it returns a named tuple with these values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,296],"elapsed":2.387372136,"_type":"aimessage"}]
