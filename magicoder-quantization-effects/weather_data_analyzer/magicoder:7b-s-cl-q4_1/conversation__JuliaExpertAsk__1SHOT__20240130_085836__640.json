Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an implementation using Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n    minTemp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if minTemp < first(temps) - 0.1 || first(temps) > minTemp + 0.1\n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif maxTemp > first(temps) + 0.1 || first(temps) < maxTemp - 0.1\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=average, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThe function starts by checking if the list of temperatures is empty. If it's empty, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\nThen it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures using Julia's built-in functions for calculating mean and finding maxima/minima.\n\nAfter that, the function checks if the first temperature in the list is closer to the maximum or minimum than the others. If this difference is larger than 0.1 degrees Celsius (an arbitrary value), it considers the trend as either increasing or decreasing. If the difference is less than this, it considers the trend as stable.\n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple with all these values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,373],"elapsed":3.014682838,"_type":"aimessage"}]
