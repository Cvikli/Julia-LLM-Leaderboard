Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia solution for your problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nstruct WeatherDataAnalyzerResult\n    average::Union{Float64,Nothing}\n    min::Union{Float64,Nothing}\n    max::Union{Float64,Nothing}\n    trend::Union{Symbol,Nothing}\nend\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return WeatherDataAnalyzerResult(nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing)\n    else\n        average = mean(temps)\n        min = minimum(temps)\n        max = maximum(temps)\n        trend = ifelse(min < 0 && min > -1e-12, :decreasing,\n                       ifelse(max < 0, :increasing, :stable))\n    end\n    return WeatherDataAnalyzerResult(average, min, max, trend)\nend\n```\nIn this code, we define a struct `WeatherDataAnalyzerResult` to store our results. We then check whether the list is empty or not. If it's empty, we return an instance of that struct with all values set as `nothing`. Otherwise, we calculate the average temperature and the min/max temperatures. Then, we use a series of conditional expressions (if-else) to determine the trend based on whether the minimum temperature is negative and positive or not. Finally, we construct a result object and return it.\n\nTest this function with your data: \n```julia\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,376],"elapsed":3.100560636,"_type":"aimessage"}]
