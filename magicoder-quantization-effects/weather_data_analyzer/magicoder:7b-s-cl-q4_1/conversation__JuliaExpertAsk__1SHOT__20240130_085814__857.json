Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's how you can create such a function in Julia. Note that in this example we assume that the trend is determined over some moving window of the data, for simplicity I'll use a sliding window of 3 days (you may want to adjust it according to your needs).\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max = maximum(temps)\n    min = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Determine the trend with a sliding window of 3 days. You can adjust this to suit your needs.\n    if length(temps) < 3\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif all(temps[1:end-2] .< temps[2:end-1])\n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif all(temps[1:end-2] .> temps[2:end-1])\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=average, max=max, min=min, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list of temperatures is empty. If it's not empty, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the Statistics package respectively. The trend is determined by comparing the temperature values for each day with the next two days. It checks if all the values are less than the next one, or all larger, in which case it declares a decreasing or increasing trend respectively, otherwise it declares the trend as stable. If the list of temperatures is empty, it returns `nothing` for all four values.\n\nYou can call this function with your data like so:\n```julia\ntemps = [23, 24, 21, 25, 26, 27, 28]\nresult = weather_data_analyzer(temps)\nprint(result)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,498],"elapsed":4.118287762,"_type":"aimessage"}]
