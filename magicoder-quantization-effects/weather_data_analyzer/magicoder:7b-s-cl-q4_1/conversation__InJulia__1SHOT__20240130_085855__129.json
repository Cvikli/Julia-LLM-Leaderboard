Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a solution for your problem in Julia. This solution uses the Statistics package to calculate the average, maximum and minimum temperatures of the given data and checks whether the temperature trend is increasing, decreasing or stable based on the difference between consecutive days:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    max = maximum(temps)\n    min = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if temps[2] > temps[1]  # temperature increasing trend\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif temps[2] < temps[1]  # temperature decreasing trend\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else  # temperature stable\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=average, max=max, min=min, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nPlease note that this function assumes the input list `temps` is a list of consecutive daily temperatures. If this assumption does not hold true for your specific use case, you may need to modify this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,286],"elapsed":2.300527506,"_type":"aimessage"}]
