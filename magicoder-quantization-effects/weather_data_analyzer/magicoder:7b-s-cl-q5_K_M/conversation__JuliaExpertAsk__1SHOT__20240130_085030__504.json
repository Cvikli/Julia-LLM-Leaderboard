Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you could solve this problem in Julia. We will use the `Statistics` standard library for statistical analysis.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    trend = ifelse(max_temp > min_temp, :increasing, \n                   (avg - min_temp) > (max_temp - avg) ? :decreasing : :stable)\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nYou can use this function to analyze the given `temps` data. If the list is empty, it will return a named tuple with all values set to nothing. Otherwise, it will calculate the average, maximum and minimum temperatures from the provided list, then determine the trend based on these figures. If the average temperature is higher than both the minimum and maximum temperatures, it's considered increasing; if lower, decreasing; otherwise, stable (if the difference between average and max/min is greater).\n\nPlease note that this function only works correctly for daily temperature data and assumes that the input `temps` is a list of daily temperatures. If your input could be different, you'll need to adjust it accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,348],"elapsed":3.086747233,"_type":"aimessage"}]
