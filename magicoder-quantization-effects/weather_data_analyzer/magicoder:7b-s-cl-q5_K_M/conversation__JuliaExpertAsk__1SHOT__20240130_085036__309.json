Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an implementation of your requested function in Julia. Note that it uses the Statistics package for performing statistical analyses on the data. Also, the trend will only be able to detect a clear increasing or decreasing trend, and won't distinguish between stable high temperatures (after a period of increase) or stable low temperatures (after a period of decrease).\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics \n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    elseif length(unique(temps)) == 1\n        return (; average=temps[1], max=temps[1], min=temps[1], trend=:stable)\n    else\n        average = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        trend_data = temps[(length(temps)-4):length(temps)]\n        if all(x -> x > trend_data[1], trend_data) \n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif all(x -> x < trend_data[1], trend_data) \n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n        \n        return (; average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list is empty or contains only one unique value. If it does, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf the list has more than one unique value, it calculates and returns the average, maximum, minimum temperatures. It then checks the last four temperature values for trend by comparing them with the first value of the list. If they are all greater or smaller, it determines that as an increasing or decreasing trend.\n\nNote: This function assumes a 4 day window for detecting trends. You may want to adjust this depending on your use case. Also, this code doesn't handle cases where there are only two unique values in the list, but more than one instance of those values exist. In such cases, the average, maximum and minimum would be equal to these two unique values and the trend might not make sense. \n\nTo use this function, you could call it like so:\n\n```julia\ntemps = [28, 31, 33, 29, 34, 36]  # example list of daily temperatures\nresults = weather_data_analyzer(temps)\nprintln(results)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,605],"elapsed":5.439273,"_type":"aimessage"}]
