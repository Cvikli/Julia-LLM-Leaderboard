[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`).

Here is an example of how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics \n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0   # If list is empty\n        return (; average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing) \n    else                     \n        avg = mean(temps)       # Average temperature\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)  # Maximum temperature\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)  # Minimum temperature\n        \n        if isempty(temps) || length(temps) == 1   \n            trend = nothing   # If there is only one temp data, it cannot determine the trend\n        else\n            diff = temps[2] - temps[1]  # Difference between first two temperatures\n            if diff > 0   \n                trend = :increasing   # Temperature is increasing\n            elseif diff < 0 \n                trend = :decreasing   # Temperature is decreasing\n            else \n                trend = :stable       # Temperature is stable\n            end \n        end \n    \n        return (; average = avg, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = trend)\n    end  \nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input list `temps` is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it computes and returns the average temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and the trend (which is determined based on whether the difference between the first two temperatures in the list is positive, negative or zero).\n\nPlease note that the function assumes that the input list `temps` contains only numbers. If this assumption doesn't hold true then you would need to add additional error checking code.","status":200,"tokens":[454,438],"elapsed":4.0525279,"_type":"aimessage"}]
