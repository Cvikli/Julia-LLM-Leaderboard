Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia. This solution uses the Statistics package for performing statistics on the data and also uses tuples to construct the result.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if avg > first(temps) && avg < last(temps)\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif avg > last(temps)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif avg < first(temps)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function works by first checking if the `temps` list is empty. If it's empty, then it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. \n\nOtherwise, it calculates the average temperature (mean), maximum and minimum temperatures, and then determines the trend based on whether the average temperature is greater than the first temperature in the list (`first(temps)`), less than the last temperature in the list (`last(temps)`) or somewhere in between. \n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple with these calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,343],"elapsed":3.04555976,"_type":"aimessage"}]
