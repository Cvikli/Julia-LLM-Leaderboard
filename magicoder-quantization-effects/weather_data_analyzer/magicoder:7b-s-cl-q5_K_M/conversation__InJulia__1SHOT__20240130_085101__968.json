[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you might implement this in Julia. This code makes use of the `Statistics` standard library:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)  # return nothing for empty list\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Determine the trend based on whether the average is greater or less than the max and min temperatures \n    if avg > max_temp && avg > min_temp\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif avg < max_temp && avg < min_temp\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list of temperatures is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average and maximum/minimum temperatures using the `mean` and `extrema` functions from the `Statistics` standard library. It then determines the trend based on whether the average is greater or less than the max and min temperatures and returns a named tuple with these values along with the determined trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,349],"elapsed":3.080231357,"_type":"aimessage"}]
