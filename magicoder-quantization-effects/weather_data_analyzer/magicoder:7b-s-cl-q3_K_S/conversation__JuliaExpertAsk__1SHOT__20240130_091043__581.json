Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can create this function in Julia as follows. Note that we need to use the Statistics and DataFrames package for performing statistical analysis.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics, DataFrames\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    n = length(temps)\n    if n == 0\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg_temp = round(mean(temps), digits=2)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    data = DataFrame(temps)\n    if n > 1\n        trend = trend_analyzer(data[!, :temps])\n    else\n        trend = nothing\n    end\n    \n    return (average=avg_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n\nfunction trend_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(unique(round.(temps))) == 1\n        return nothing\n    elseif temps[end] > temps[end-1]\n        return :increasing\n    elseif temps[end] < temps[end-1]\n        return :decreasing\n    else\n        return :stable\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this function, we first handle the case when the input list is empty. For non-empty lists, we calculate the average, maximum and minimum temperatures, then use DataFrames package to check whether the temperature trend changes over time. \n\nThe trend_analyzer function calculates trend of a given temperature series using only previous two values. If the last two temperatures are in increasing order, the trend is `:increasing`. If they are in decreasing order, the trend is `:decreasing`. Else (the trend doesn't change over time), the trend is `:stable`. \n\nPlease ensure that you have added necessary dependencies (`Statistics` and `DataFrames`) before running this script.","status":200,"tokens":[184,471],"elapsed":3.842035791,"_type":"aimessage"}]
