Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could write this function in Julia. Note that in order to perform statistical analyses on data, we'll import the `Statistics` package and use its functions:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n    minTemp = minimum(temps)\n    trend = nothing\n    \n    if maxTemp - avg > 0.01\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif avg - minTemp > 0.01\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=avg, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nHere's how you could call the function:\n\n```julia\ntemps = [23.0, 24.0, 25.6, 27.1, 29.0]\nresult = weather_data_analyzer(temps)\nprintln(\"Average temperature: $(result.average)\")\nprintln(\"Maximum temperature: $(result.max)\")\nprintln(\"Minimum temperature: $(result.min)\")\nprintln(\"Temperature trend: $(result.trend)\")\n```\nIn this example, the function would return a named tuple with the average, maximum and minimum temperatures from the `temps` array as well as the trend indicating whether the temperatures are increasing, decreasing or remaining stable. \n\nRemember that this is just an example. The function needs to be adjusted based on the precise requirements of your task.","status":200,"tokens":[0,418],"elapsed":3.35789682,"_type":"aimessage"}]
