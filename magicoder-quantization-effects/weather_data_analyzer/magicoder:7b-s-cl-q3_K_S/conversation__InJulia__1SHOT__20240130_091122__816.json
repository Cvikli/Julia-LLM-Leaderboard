The function needs to calculate the average temperature, the maximum and minimum temperatures, as well as identify whether the daily temperatures have an upward trend or not. \n\nThe `Statistics` package provides the functions `mean`, `extrema`, and `Base.show` that we can use to compute our desired statistics from a list of numbers. However, it doesn't provide a direct method for identifying the trend of the temperatures, so we will need to write a custom function to determine this.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    temp_range = extrema(temps)\n    max = temp_range.max\n    min = temp_range.min\n    \n    # identify the trend of the data (increasing, decreasing or stable)\n    if temps[1] < temps[2]  # first two days have increasing temperatures\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif temps[1] > temps[2]   # first two days have decreasing temperatures\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else  # daily temperature remains same (stable)\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=average, max=max, min=min, trend=trend)\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,354],"elapsed":2.800394205,"_type":"aimessage"}]
