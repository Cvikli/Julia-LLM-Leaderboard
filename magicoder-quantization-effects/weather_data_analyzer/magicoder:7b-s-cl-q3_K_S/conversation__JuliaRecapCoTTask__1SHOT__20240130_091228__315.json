[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"This problem involves statistical analysis of temperature data using Julia's Standard Library. Here is how you could implement this:\n\nFirstly, install the Statistics package if it's not already installed by running `using Pkg; Pkg.add(\"Statistics\");` in your Julia console. \n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        average = mean(temps)\n        maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n        minTemp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if length(unique(diff(temps))) == 1\n            return (average=average, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=:stable)\n        elseif maxTemp < average\n            return (average=average, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=:decreasing)\n        else\n            return (average=average, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=:increasing)\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first checking if the input list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing.\n\nIf the list isn't empty, it calculates the average temperature and the maximum and minimum temperatures. It then checks whether the maximum temperature is less than or equal to the average temperature. Based on this comparison, it determines whether the trend of the data is increasing (`:increasing`), decreasing (`:decreasing`) or stable (`:stable`). \n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple containing the calculated average, maximum and minimum temperatures, as well as the determined trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,400],"elapsed":3.267595786,"_type":"aimessage"}]
