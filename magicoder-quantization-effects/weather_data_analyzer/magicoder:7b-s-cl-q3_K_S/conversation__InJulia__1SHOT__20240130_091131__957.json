Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's one way you could do it in Julia. Note that this solution assumes that temperature data cannot be equal and that trend can only be one of the three options mentioned:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Return a named tuple with all values set to nothing if list is empty\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    trend = nothing\n    if average > temps[1]\n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif average < temps[1]\n        trend = :increasing\n    else \n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list is empty and returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing if that's the case. Then it calculates the `mean`, `maximum` (max), and `minimum` (min) temperatures using the `Statistics` package. It determines the trend based on whether the average temperature is above, below or equal to the first element in the list, and sets this as either `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`. Finally it returns a named tuple containing all these results.","status":200,"tokens":[0,349],"elapsed":2.782235057,"_type":"aimessage"}]
