Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's one way to solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if temps[1] > temps[end] \n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif temps[1] < temps[end] \n        trend = :increasing\n    else \n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the `temps` list is empty.

It also checks to see if the first temperature in the list is higher than the last, or if it is lower. If this is true, it sets the trend to `:increasing`. If it isn't true, it means that the first and last temperatures are equal, so it sets the trend to `:stable` (since there isn't any clear pattern of temperature increase or decrease).\n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple with all four calculated values (`avg`, `max_temp`, `min_temp`, and `trend`).","status":200,"tokens":[0,401],"elapsed":3.218063986,"_type":"aimessage"}]
