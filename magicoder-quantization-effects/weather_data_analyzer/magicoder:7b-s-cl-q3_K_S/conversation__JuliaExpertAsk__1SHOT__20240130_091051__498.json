Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is Julia solution for the problem.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics: mean, extrema\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        trend = nothing\n    elseif temps[1] < temps[2]\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :increasing\n    end\n\n    average, (min_temp, max_temp) = extrema(temps)\n\n    NamedTuple{(:average, :max, :min, :trend), Tuple{Union{Float64,Nothing}, Union{Int, Nothing}, Union{Int, Nothing}, Union{Symbol,Nothing}}} \n        (; average=average, max=(max_temp == temps[1] ? nothing : max_temp), min=(min_temp == temps[1] ? nothing : min_temp), trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks whether the list of temperatures is empty. If it is not, then it determines the direction of temperature change by comparing the first two values in the list. Then it uses the `extrema` function from the Statistics package to compute the minimum and maximum values, and takes their average as the overall average temperature. The function finally returns a named tuple containing these computed statistics.","status":200,"tokens":[0,296],"elapsed":2.379139121,"_type":"aimessage"}]
