Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could implement this in Julia. This solution uses the Statistics package which is included in Julia's standard library:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics: mean, maximum, minimum\nimport Base.NamedTuple: NamedTuple\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return NamedTuple{Symbol(\"avg\"), Float64, :max => nothing, :min => nothing, :trend => nothing}() \n    end\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    trend = if avg < temps[end]\n        :increasing\n    elseif avg > temps[end] \n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n    \n    return NamedTuple{Symbol(\"avg\"), Float64, :max => max_temp, :min => min_temp, :trend => trend}() \nend\n```\nIn this solution we first check if the list is empty. If it is then we construct a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Then we calculate the average temperature using the mean function from the Statistics package, maximum and minimum temperatures using the maximum and minimum functions respectively, and finally determine whether the trend is increasing, decreasing or stable by comparing the average temperature with the last element in the list.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that you have a single-threaded CPU. The behavior might be different on multi-core systems because of thread scheduling.","status":200,"tokens":[0,358],"elapsed":2.840899563,"_type":"aimessage"}]
