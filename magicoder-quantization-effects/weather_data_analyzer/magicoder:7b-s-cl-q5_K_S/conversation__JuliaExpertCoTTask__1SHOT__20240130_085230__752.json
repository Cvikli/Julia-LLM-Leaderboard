Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you would write this Julia code. \nFirstly we are importing the Statistics package which provides functions for data analysis such as mean and extrema. After that we define our function `weather_data_analyzer` which accepts a list of temperatures, calculates average, maximum and minimum temperatures using statistics.minmax method, checks if temperature list is empty or not. If it's empty then returns named tuple with all values set to nothing else computes trend based on maximum and minimum temperatures.\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0   # checking if the list is empty\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    minTemp,maxTemp = extrema(temps)\n    \n    if maxTemp - minTemp > 0\n       trend = :increasing\n    elseif maxTemp - minTemp < 0\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nYou can now call the function with your data: `weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])` and it should return a named tuple containing the required information.","status":200,"tokens":[0,340],"elapsed":2.962233595,"_type":"aimessage"}]
