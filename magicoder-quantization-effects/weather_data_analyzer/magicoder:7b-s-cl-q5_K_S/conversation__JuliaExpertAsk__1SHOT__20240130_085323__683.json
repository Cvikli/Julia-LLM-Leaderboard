Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution using Julia's built-in statistical package `Statistics`:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)  # return nothing for an empty list\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    trend_symbol = ifelse(max_temp > avg, :increasing,\n                           (min_temp < avg) ? :decreasing : :stable)\n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend_symbol)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty. If so, it returns a named tuple with `nothing` for all values. \nIf the list isn't empty, it calculates the average (`avg`), maximum (`max_temp`) and minimum (`min_temp`) temperatures using Julia's built-in statistical functions. It then checks whether the maximum temperature is greater than the average or not to determine the trend and assigns a string `:increasing`, `:decreasing` or `:stable` accordingly.\nFinally, it constructs and returns a named tuple with all these values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,315],"elapsed":2.71783182,"_type":"aimessage"}]
