Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia. Firstly, we need to install the Statistics package if it isn't already installed. You can do that by running `Pkg.add(\"Statistics\")` in your Julia console.\n\nHere is a possible solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        average = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if average > max_temp\n            trend = :decreasing\n        elseif average < min_temp\n            trend = :increasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n\n        return (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list of temperatures is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures using functions from the Statistics package. Then it determines the trend based on whether the average temperature is greater than or less than either the maximum or minimum temperature. Finally, it constructs and returns the named tuple containing these results.","status":200,"tokens":[0,321],"elapsed":2.697097919,"_type":"aimessage"}]
