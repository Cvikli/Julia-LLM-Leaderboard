Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can implement this in Julia. Firstly, make sure you have installed the Statistics package by running `] add Statistics` in your Julia console.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if avg > max_temp\n            trend = :decreasing\n        elseif avg < min_temp\n            trend = :increasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n        \n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. If not, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures using the Statistics package's functions for mean, maximum and minimum respectively. It then determines the trend based on whether the average temperature is greater than or less than both the max and min temperatures. Finally, it returns a named tuple with these calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,304],"elapsed":2.562629685,"_type":"aimessage"}]
