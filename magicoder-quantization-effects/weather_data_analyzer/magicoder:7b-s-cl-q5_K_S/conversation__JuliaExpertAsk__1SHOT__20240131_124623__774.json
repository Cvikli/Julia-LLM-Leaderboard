Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if avg < first(temps)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif avg > last(temps)\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list is empty. If it is, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Then it calculates the mean (`average`), maximum (`max`), and minimum (`min`) temperatures from the data. Next, based on these computed statistics, it determines the trend (whether the average temperature is increasing, decreasing, or stable compared to the first and last values in the list). Finally, it returns a named tuple with these computed statistics and trend information.","status":200,"tokens":[184,300],"elapsed":2.611941024,"_type":"aimessage"}]
