Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`).

If it is, we return a named tuple with `nothing` for each value that will be calculated. Then, we calculate the average, maximum and minimum temperatures using built-in methods in the `Statistics` package. We determine the trend based on whether all the differences between consecutive elements are positive (indicating an increasing trend), negative (indicating a decreasing trend), or zero (indicating a stable trend). Finally, we return a named tuple containing these calculated values with appropriate keys.","status":200,"tokens":[0,420],"elapsed":3.5941024,"_type":"aimessage"}]
