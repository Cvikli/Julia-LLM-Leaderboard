Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia using the Statistics package:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        temp_trend = nothing\n        if length(unique(diff([max_temp; temps]))) == 1 && diff([max_temp; temps])[1] > 0\n            temp_trend = :increasing\n        elseif length(unique(diff([min_temp; temps]))) == 1 && diff([min_temp; temps])[1] < 0\n            temp_trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            temp_trend = :stable\n        end\n        \n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=temp_trend)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list `temps` is empty. If it's not, then it calculates the mean (`avg`), maximum (`max_temp`), and minimum (`min_temp`) of the list using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions respectively from the Statistics package.\n\nThen it checks the trend of the temperature data by checking if all consecutive differences are equal and in the same direction (either increasing or decreasing). If this is true, then the trend is set to `:increasing` or `:decreasing`. Otherwise, it's set to `:stable`.\n\nFinally, a named tuple with these calculated values is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,404],"elapsed":3.472701524,"_type":"aimessage"}]
