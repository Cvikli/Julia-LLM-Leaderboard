Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    if avg > max_temp || avg < min_temp\n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif avg == max_temp && avg == min_temp\n        trend = :stable\n    else\n        trend = :increasing\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list of temperatures is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf the list is not empty, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperature using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package. It then determines the trend based on these values: if the average is greater than either the maximum or minimum, it's set to `:decreasing`. If the average equals both the maximum and minimum, it's set to `:stable`. Otherwise, it's set to `:increasing`.\n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple with these values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,350],"elapsed":2.954166533,"_type":"aimessage"}]
