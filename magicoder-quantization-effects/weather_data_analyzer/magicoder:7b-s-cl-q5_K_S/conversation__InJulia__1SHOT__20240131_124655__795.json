Note that we need to import the Statistics package for some functions like mean and extrema.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n    minTemp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    trend = nothing  # Initialize as 'nothing'\n    if length(temps) > 1 && temps[2] - temps[1] > 0\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif length(temps) > 1 && temps[2] - temps[1] < 0\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=average, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list is empty. If it's empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. Then it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures from the given list. To determine the trend, it compares the difference between consecutive elements in the list. If the difference is positive, it means the temperature is increasing, if it's negative, it means the temperature is decreasing. In any other case, it means the temperature is stable. It then returns a named tuple containing these calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[154,361],"elapsed":3.119753915,"_type":"aimessage"}]
