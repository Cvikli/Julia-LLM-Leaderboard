Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can do it. \n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if avg > max_temp || avg < min_temp\n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif avg == max_temp && avg == min_temp\n        trend = :stable\n    else\n        trend = :increasing\n    end\n    \n    (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function works by first checking if the list `temps` is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. \n\nIf the list isn't empty, it calculates the average (`avg`), maximum (`max_temp`) and minimum (`min_temp`) temperatures from the data using functions from the `Statistics` package. \n\nThen it checks if the average is greater than either the max or min, less than either of them, or equal to both. Depending on which condition applies, it sets the `trend` value to `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`. \n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple containing the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,348],"elapsed":3.000293434,"_type":"aimessage"}]
