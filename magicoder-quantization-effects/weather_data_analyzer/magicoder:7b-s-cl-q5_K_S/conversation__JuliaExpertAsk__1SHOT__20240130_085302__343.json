Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example solution for your problem. Note that I'm assuming you have loaded the `Statistics` package in your Julia environment:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics  # Don't forget to import the statistics package\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Check if list is empty\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    # Calculate statistical measures\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Determine the trend\n    if length(temps) < 2\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif temps[1] < temps[2]\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif temps[1] > temps[2]\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    # Construct the named tuple with the results\n    return (; average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list of daily temperatures is empty. If it is, then a `namedtuple` is returned with all values set to `nothing`.\n\nIf the list isn't empty, then statistical measures are calculated for the average temperature, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature. The trend is determined based on whether the first two temperatures in the list are increasing or decreasing relative to each other (if they exist).","status":200,"tokens":[0,365],"elapsed":3.159514429,"_type":"aimessage"}]
