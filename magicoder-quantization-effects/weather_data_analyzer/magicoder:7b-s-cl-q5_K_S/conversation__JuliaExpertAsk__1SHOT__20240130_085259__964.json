Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you can solve this problem in Julia. \n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n        minTemp = minimum(temps)\n        trend = :stable\n        \n        if avg > 0\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif avg < 0\n            trend = :decreasing\n        end\n        \n        return (; average=avg, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this function, we first check if the `temps` list is empty. If it is, we return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf `temps` isn't empty, we calculate the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the built-in functions in the `Statistics` package. Then we determine the trend of temperature based on the average temperature. \n\nIf the average is greater than zero, we conclude that there's an increasing trend. If it's less than zero, we conclude that there's a decreasing trend. Otherwise, we declare that there isn't any discernible trend (stable). We then return this data as a named tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,335],"elapsed":2.891531895,"_type":"aimessage"}]
