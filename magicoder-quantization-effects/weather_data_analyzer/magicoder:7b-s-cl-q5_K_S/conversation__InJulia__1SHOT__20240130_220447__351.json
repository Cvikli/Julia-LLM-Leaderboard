Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia. Firstly, you need to install the Statistics package if it isn't installed yet. You can do that by running `Pkg.add(\"Statistics\")` in your Julia console. \n\nNow let's write the function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if avg > max_temp\n            trend = :decreasing\n        elseif avg < min_temp\n            trend = :increasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n\n        return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list is empty. If it's empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. If it's not empty, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures and determines the trend based on these statistics. The trend is determined by comparing the average temperature with the maximum and minimum temperature. If the average is greater than the maximum, the trend is decreasing; if it's less than the minimum, the trend is increasing; otherwise, the trend is stable.","status":200,"tokens":[0,348],"elapsed":2.928995348,"_type":"aimessage"}]
