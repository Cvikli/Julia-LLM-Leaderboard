Firstly, we need to install the Statistics package if it isn't already installed. You can do so by running `]add Statistics` in your Julia console or adding it to your `Project.toml` file.\n\nAfter that, here is a possible implementation of the function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        average = mean(temps)\n        maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n        minTemp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if average > maxTemp\n            trend = :decreasing\n        elseif average < minTemp\n            trend = :increasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n\n        return (average=average, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list of daily temperatures is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. If not, it calculates the average and maximum/minimum temperatures, then determines the trend based on whether the average temperature is greater than or less than both the maxTemp and minTemp. The function finally returns a named tuple containing these calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,321],"elapsed":2.697927224,"_type":"aimessage"}]
