Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple implementation of your problem in Julia. This solution uses the Statistics package for calculating the average and trend of the temperatures data.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; \n            average=nothing,\n            max=nothing,\n            min=nothing,\n            trend=nothing\n        )\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if avg > max_temp\n            trend = :decreasing\n        elseif avg < min_temp\n            trend = :increasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n        \n        return (; \n            average=avg,\n            max=max_temp,\n            min=min_temp,\n            trend=trend\n        )\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list of temperatures is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperature from the list, and then determines the trend based on these values. The trend is determined as `:increasing` if the average is greater than both the max and min temperatures, `:decreasing` if the average is lesser than both the max and min temperatures, and `:stable` otherwise.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\ntemps = [23, 19, 25, 20, 26]\nresult = weather_data_analyzer(temps)\nprintln(\"Average temperature: $(result.average)\")\nprintln(\"Maximum temperature: $(result.max)\")\nprintln(\"Minimum temperature: $(result.min)\")\nprintln(\"Trend: $(result.trend)\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[184,437],"elapsed":3.738869998,"_type":"aimessage"}]
