Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can write such a function in Julia. Note that this uses the `Statistics` package for computing the mean and extrema of the data:\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        stats = (average=mean(temps), \n                 max=maximum(temps), \n                 min=minimum(temps))\n\n        if stats.average > stats.max \n            trend = :decreasing\n        elseif stats.average < stats.min \n            trend = :increasing\n        else \n            trend = :stable\n        end\n        \n        return (;stats...,trend)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThe function first checks if the `temps` list is empty, in which case it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. If the list is not empty, it computes the mean and extremes of the data using Julia's built-in statistics functions. It then determines the trend based on whether the average temperature is greater than or lesser than the max or min respectively (or if they are equal), setting it to `:decreasing`, `:increasing` or `:stable` respectively. Finally, it constructs and returns a named tuple containing these statistics and trend information.","status":200,"tokens":[0,325],"elapsed":2.807530206,"_type":"aimessage"}]
