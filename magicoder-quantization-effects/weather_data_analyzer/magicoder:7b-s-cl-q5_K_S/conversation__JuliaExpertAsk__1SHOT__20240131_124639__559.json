Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could solve this problem in Julia. This solution uses the `Statistics` package for calculating the average, max and min temperatures and checks if the trend is increasing, decreasing or stable based on the differences between consecutive elements in the list:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n    minTemp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    diffs = diff(temps)\n    if all(diff .>= 0, diff)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(diff .<= 0, diff)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list is empty. If it's empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. If not, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures by using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package. Then it checks if all the differences between consecutive elements in the list are greater than or equal to zero (indicating that the temperature is increasing) or less than or equal to zero (indicating that the temperature is decreasing). If both conditions are not true, then the trend is considered to be stable. Finally, it returns a named tuple containing the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,390],"elapsed":3.348532443,"_type":"aimessage"}]
