Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can define this function in Julia using the Statistics package. The trend is determined as follows: if the average temperature increases from day to day, it's `:increasing`; if it decreases, it's `:decreasing`; otherwise, it's `:stable`.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # If the list is empty return nothing for all values\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    # Calculate stats\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Determine the trend\n    if avg > temps[1]\n        trend = :increasing \n    elseif avg < temps[1]\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the `temps` list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures using `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from Statistics package. The trend is determined by comparing the average temperature to the first value in the list. If average > first value, then trend = `:increasing`. If average < first value, then trend = `:decreasing`. Otherwise, trend = `:stable`.\n\nYou can test this function with some sample data like:\n```julia\ntemps = [23, 25, 24, 26, 27]\nprintln(weather_data_analyzer(temps)) # average=25.0, max=27.0, min=23.0, trend=:increasing\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,470],"elapsed":4.058387363,"_type":"aimessage"}]
