Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you can achieve this in Julia. We will use the Statistics package for our statistical analyses and NamedTuple for creating named tuples:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    if length(unique(diff([avg, max_temp, min_temp]))) == 1\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif max_temp > avg && max_temp > min_temp\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif min_temp < avg && min_temp < max_temp\n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n\n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Then it calculates the mean (`avg`), maximum (`max_temp`) and minimum (`min_temp`) temperatures from the given list. It also determines the trend of these temperatures based on the principle that if all three measurements are in the same direction, then the trend is considered to be stable (`:stable`). Otherwise, it checks whether the maximum temperature is higher than both average and minimum temperature, or the minimum temperature is lower than both average and maximum temperature. If this condition holds true, it sets the `trend` to `:increasing` or `:decreasing`.\n\nYou can test this function with a list of daily temperatures as follows:\n```julia\ntemps = [23, 25, 19, 28, 20, 26, 24]\nprint(weather_data_analyzer(temps))\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,464],"elapsed":8.076175036,"_type":"aimessage"}]
