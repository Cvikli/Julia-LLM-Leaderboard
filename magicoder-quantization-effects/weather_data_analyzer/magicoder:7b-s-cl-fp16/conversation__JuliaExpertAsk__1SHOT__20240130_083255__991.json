Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you might solve this problem. For simplicity, let's assume that our daily temperature data consists only of integers. Note that we have used the DataFrames and Statistics packages for this analysis. Please install these packages if not already installed:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Check if temps is empty or not\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    data = DataFrame(Temps = temps)\n    avg_temp = mean(data.Temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(data.Temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(data.Temps)\n    if avg_temp < first(temps)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif avg_temp > last(temps)\n        trend = :increasing\n    else \n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the `temps` list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \nIf `temps` is not empty, it creates a DataFrame and computes the average (`mean`), maximum (`maximum`), minimum (`minimum`) temperatures. It then determines the trend based on whether the average temperature is less than the first element in `temps`, greater than the last element in `temps`, or somewhere in between (stable). Finally, it returns a named tuple with these computed values.\n\nRemember to install the required packages using: \n```julia\nPkg.add(\"DataFrames\")\nPkg.add(\"Statistics\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,423],"elapsed":7.464673384,"_type":"aimessage"}]
