Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can implement this in Julia.

If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\nIf the list is not empty, it calculates the average temperature and the maximum and minimum temperatures. It then checks whether all subsequent differences are positive or negative (indicating an increasing or decreasing trend). The function finally returns a named tuple containing these calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,333],"elapsed":5.764289718,"_type":"aimessage"}]
