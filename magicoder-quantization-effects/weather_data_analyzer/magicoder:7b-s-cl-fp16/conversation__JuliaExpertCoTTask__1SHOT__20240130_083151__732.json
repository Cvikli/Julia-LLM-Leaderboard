Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can approach this problem. This solution assumes that the Julia programming language is already installed on your computer and that the Statistics package is also installed. If not, install them by using Pkg add or Pkg.add commands in Julia console:\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        diff = max_temp - min_temp\n        if diff == 0.0\n            return (; average = avg, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = :stable)\n        elseif diff > 0.0\n            return (; average = avg, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = :increasing)\n        else\n            return (; average = avg, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = :decreasing)\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n```\nIn this solution, the `weather_data_analyzer` function first checks if the input list is empty. If it is, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. Otherwise, it calculates the average temperature, maximum and minimum temperatures from the data using Julia's built-in functions for mean, maximum, and minimum respectively. It then checks the difference between max_temp and min_temp to determine the trend. If the difference is 0, it returns a named tuple with the `average`, `max` and `min` temperatures and sets `trend` as :stable. If the difference is positive (meaning the maximum temperature is greater than the minimum), it returns a named tuple with all the calculated values and sets `trend` as :increasing. Otherwise, it returns a named tuple with all the calculated values and sets `trend` as :decreasing.","status":200,"tokens":[0,493],"elapsed":8.833542199,"_type":"aimessage"}]
