Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how this could be done in Julia using the Statistics package. Note that we'll use the `TupleN` type for creating our results:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    else\n        average = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if max_temp > min_temp \n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif max_temp < min_temp \n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n        return (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThe `weather_data_analyzer` function works as follows: If the length of `temps` is 0, it will return a named tuple with all values set to nothing. Otherwise, it calculates the mean (`average`), maximum (`max`) and minimum (`min`) temperatures using the built-in functions from the Statistics package. It then checks whether the maximum temperature is greater than the minimum or not to determine the `trend` (either `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). Finally, it returns a named tuple with these values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,334],"elapsed":5.884063634,"_type":"aimessage"}]
