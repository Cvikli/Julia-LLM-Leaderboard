Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia. Firstly, we need to install the Statistics package if it isn't already installed. You can do that by running `] add Statistics` in your Julia console or using Pkg.add(\"Statistics\") in your code:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # If the list is empty, return a named tuple with all values set to nothing\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Determine the trend based on the difference between consecutive elements in the list\n    diffs = diff([min_temp; max_temp])\n    if all(x -> x > 0, diffs)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(x -> x < 0, diffs)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nYou can test this function with the following code:\n\n```julia\ntemps = [23, 24, 25, 26, 27] # example list of daily temperatures\nprintln(weather_data_analyzer(temps))\n```\n\nThis will print a named tuple containing the average, max, min, and trend values for the given list of temperatures.","status":200,"tokens":[0,387],"elapsed":6.694837374,"_type":"aimessage"}]
