[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        trend_symbol = ifelse(avg > max_temp, :decreasing,\n                              (avg < min_temp ? :increasing : :stable))\n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend_symbol)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list `temps` is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing.\n\nIf `temps` is not empty, it calculates the average (`avg`), maximum (`max_temp`), and minimum (`min_temp`) temperatures using Julia's built-in functions for these calculations. Then, it determines whether the trend of temperature changes by comparing the average temperature to the highest and lowest temperatures. \n\nIf the average is greater than all other temperatures (meaning it's decreasing), the `trend_symbol` is set to `:decreasing`. If the average is lower than all other temperatures, the trend is considered to be increasing (`:increasing`). Otherwise, if there are no obvious trends, the trend is marked as `:stable`. \n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple containing these values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,369],"elapsed":6.522565808,"_type":"aimessage"}]
