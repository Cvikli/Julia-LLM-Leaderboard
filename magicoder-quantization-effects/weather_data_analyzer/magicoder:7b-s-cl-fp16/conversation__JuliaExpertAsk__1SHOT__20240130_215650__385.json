Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can implement this in Julia. Firstly, install the Statistics package if it's not installed yet by running `] add Statistics` in your Julia REPL.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Check if list is empty\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    # Calculate statistics\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Determine the trend\n    if length(unique(diff([0; temps]))) == 1\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif diff([0; temps])[2] > 0\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n    \n    # Return named tuple\n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first checking if the input list is empty. If it's empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the Statistics package. Then, it determines the trend by checking if there is only one unique difference between consecutive temperatures (i.e., they're all equal), or if the second difference is positive (indicating an increasing trend) or negative (indicating a decreasing trend). Finally, it returns a named tuple with these calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,392],"elapsed":6.797658324,"_type":"aimessage"}]
