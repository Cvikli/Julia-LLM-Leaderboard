[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might write this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics  # Required for calculating mean, maximum and minimum temperatures\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n        minTemp = minimum(temps)\n        trendVal = isnan(avg) ? :unknown : (avg > 0 ?

If it's not empty, then calculates the mean, maximum and minimum temperatures. It also determines whether the temperature data trends upwards (`increasing`), downwards (`decreasing`) or remains stable (`stable`). The trend of the data is determined by dividing the maximum temperature by the average temperature (or 1 if the average is NaN due to a single value in the array) and checking which of the three trends it falls under. If the average is NaN, then that means there was no change over time so we return `:unknown`.\n\nNote: This function assumes temperatures are non-negative integers. If negative or fractional numbers are possible, additional checks may be required to correctly determine if temperature data is increasing, decreasing, or stable.","status":200,"tokens":[0,378],"elapsed":6.683304342,"_type":"aimessage"}]
