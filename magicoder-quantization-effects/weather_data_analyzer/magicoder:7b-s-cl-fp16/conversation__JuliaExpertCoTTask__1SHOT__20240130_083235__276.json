Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might write this code in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    else\n        avg_temp = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if avg_temp > max_temp\n            trend = :decreasing\n        elseif avg_temp < min_temp\n            trend = :increasing\n        else \n            trend = :stable\n        end\n\n        return (average=avg_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nYou can test the function using:\n```julia\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n```\nThis function first checks if the length of `temps` is zero. If it is, then it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. Otherwise, it calculates the mean and maximum/minimum temperatures from the list using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions respectively. It then compares these computed values to decide on the trend and finally constructs and returns the named tuple with these calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,333],"elapsed":5.899965363,"_type":"aimessage"}]
