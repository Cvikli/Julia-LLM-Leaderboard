Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package).

Note that we use the `Statistics` package for calculating average and other statistical measures:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    trend = ifelse(avg > first(temps), :increasing, \n                   ifelse(avg < first(temps), :decreasing, :stable))\n    \n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list of temperatures is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf the list has elements, it calculates the average temperature using the `mean` function from the `Statistics` package, and then finds the maximum and minimum temperatures using the `maximum` and `minimum` functions respectively. \n\nFinally, it determines the trend of the data based on whether the average is greater than or less than the first temperature in the list. If the average is greater, the trend is `:increasing`. If the average is less, the trend is `:decreasing`. Otherwise, if the average equals the first temperature (or the list is empty), the trend is `:stable`. \n\nThe results are returned as a named tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,375],"elapsed":6.502096233,"_type":"aimessage"}]
