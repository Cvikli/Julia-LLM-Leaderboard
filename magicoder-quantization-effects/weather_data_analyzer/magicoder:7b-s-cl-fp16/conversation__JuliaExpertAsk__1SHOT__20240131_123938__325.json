Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's one way you could solve this problem using Julia. This solution assumes that the `Statistics` package is already installed and imported in your Julia environment:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if avg > max_temp\n            trend = :decreasing\n        elseif avg < min_temp\n            trend = :increasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n\n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list of temperatures is empty. If it's not empty, it calculates the mean (`avg`), maximum (`max_temp`), and minimum (`min_temp`) values. It then determines the `trend` based on whether the average temperature is greater than, less than, or equal to all other temperatures.\n\nThe results are returned as a named tuple with keys `average`, `max`, `min`, and `trend`. If the list of temperatures was empty, it returns a named tuple where every value is set to `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,330],"elapsed":5.723615867,"_type":"aimessage"}]
