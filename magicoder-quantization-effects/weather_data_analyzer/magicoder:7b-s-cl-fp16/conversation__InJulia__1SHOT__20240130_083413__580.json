If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nOtherwise, it computes the average (`avg`), maximum (`max_temp`) and minimum (`min_temp`) temperature from the list. It then determines the trend based on these computed values: if the average equals the maximum, it is considered \"stable\" (neither increasing nor decreasing); if the average is less than the maximum, it's considered \"increasing\"; otherwise, it's considered \"decreasing\". \n\nThe function returns a named tuple containing these computed values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,365],"elapsed":6.428690854,"_type":"aimessage"}]
