[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you can implement this in Julia. We will use the `Statistics` package for our statistical analyses and the `NamedTuple` type for constructing our results. Note that we assume that the list is not empty:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if average > max_temp\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif average < min_temp\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first checking if the list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. If not, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package. It then determines the trend based on whether the average temperature is greater than or less than both the maximum and minimum temperatures. Finally, it returns a named tuple with these values.","status":200,"tokens":[154,330],"elapsed":5.723032247,"_type":"aimessage"}]
