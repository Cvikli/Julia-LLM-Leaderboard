Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia. Firstly, we need to install the Statistics package if it isn't installed yet using Pkg.add(\"Statistics\") command in Julia. Afterwards, we can write our function as follows:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Check if list is empty\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    trend_symbol = :increasing\n    for i in 2:length(temps)\n        if temps[i] < temps[i-1]\n            trend_symbol = :decreasing\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend_symbol)\nend\n```\nThis function works by first checking if the list of temperatures is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. \n\nIf there are temperatures in the list, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperature using `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from Statistics package. It also checks if the temperature trend is decreasing by comparing each consecutive pair of temperatures (from second to last to first) and setting `trend_symbol` to `:decreasing` when it finds a decrease.\n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple with calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,370],"elapsed":6.440135434,"_type":"aimessage"}]
