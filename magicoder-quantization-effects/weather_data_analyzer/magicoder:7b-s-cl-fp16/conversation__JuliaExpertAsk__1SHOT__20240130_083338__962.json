Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you could define this function in Julia. Please note that the \"Statistics\" package is not part of standard Julia installation, it needs to be added via Pkg.add(\"Statistics\") or Pkg.add(Statistics). \n\n```julia\nusing Statistics # Importing necessary packages\n\n# Define the named tuple type for results\nResults = NamedTuple{(:average, :max, :min, :trend), Tuple{Union{Float64, Nothing}, Union{Int, Nothing}, Union{Int, Nothing}, Symbol}}\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Check if the list is empty and return a named tuple with nothing values for all fields.\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=:stable)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Check the trend using a simple difference\n    if length(temps) > 1 && diff([first(temps);last(temps)])[1] < 0\n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif length(temps) > 1 && diff([first(temps);last(temps)])[1] > 0\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return Results((average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend))\nend\n```\nIn this function, we first check if the list is empty. If it is, we construct and return a named tuple with nothing values for all fields. We then compute the average temperature, maximum and minimum temperatures using functions from the Statistics package. \n\nFor the trend, we take advantage of the fact that the difference in successive elements of the list gives us the direction of change. If this difference is negative, we assume that the temperature has decreased. If it's positive, we assume the temperature has increased. In both cases, we consider that if there's only one element or no changes, the trend is \"stable\". \n\nFinally, we return a named tuple containing these calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,509],"elapsed":8.941994682,"_type":"aimessage"}]
