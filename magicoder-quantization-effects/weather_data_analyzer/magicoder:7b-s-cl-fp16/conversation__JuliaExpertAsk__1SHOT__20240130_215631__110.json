Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia. We will use the Statistics package for calculating the mean and extrema of the data, and we will check if the trend is increasing, decreasing or stable based on the difference between consecutive elements in the list:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    n = length(temps)\n    if n == 0\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    diffs = [temps[i+1] - temps[i] for i in 1:n-1]\n    if all(diff .>= 0 for diff in diffs)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(diff .<= 0 for diff in diffs)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the mean and extrema of the data using the `mean` and `extrema` functions from the Statistics package. It then checks the trend by comparing each consecutive pair of temperatures in the list. If they are always increasing, it sets the trend to `:increasing`. If they are all decreasing, it sets the trend to `:decreasing`. Otherwise (if there is no consistent pattern), it sets the trend to `:stable`. Finally, it returns a named tuple with the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,418],"elapsed":7.235742672,"_type":"aimessage"}]
