Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia. First, we need to install and import the Statistics package if it isn't installed yet:\n\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"Statistics\")\nusing Statistics\n```\n\nNow let's define our function `weather_data_analyzer`:\n\n```julia\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if avg > max_temp\n            trend = :decreasing\n        elseif avg < min_temp\n            trend = :increasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n\n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list of temperatures is empty. If it's empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf the list isn't empty, it calculates the average (`avg`), maximum (`max_temp`) and minimum (`min_temp`) temperature using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the Statistics package. It then checks if the average is greater than or equal to the maximum or less than or equal to the minimum, and sets the trend accordingly: `:increasing` if the average is larger than all temperatures, `:decreasing` if the average is smaller than all temperatures, and `:stable` otherwise.\n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple with `average`, `max`, `min` and `trend`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,420],"elapsed":7.280535827,"_type":"aimessage"}]
