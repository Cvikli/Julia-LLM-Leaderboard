Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can implement this function as follows. The function uses the Statistics package for basic statistical analyses and checks for the trend using simple comparisons between successive elements in the data list.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg_temp = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if length(temps) < 2\n            return (average=avg_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=nothing)\n        end\n        \n        trend = ifelse(temps[1] <= temps[2], :increasing, ifelse(temps[1] >= temps[2], :decreasing, :stable))\n        \n        return (average=avg_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this code:\n- The `isempty(temps)` function checks if the list is empty. If true, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n- It uses the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the Statistics package to calculate the average, maximum and minimum temperatures respectively.\n- If there are less than 2 elements in the list, the function simply returns these calculated values along with a trend value set to `nothing`.\n- If there are more than 1 element, it checks the direction of temperature change between the first and second elements by comparing them with the `<=` operator. If they are not changing, it uses the `>` operator instead. In either case, if the temperatures remain constant, it sets the trend to `:stable`. The resulting trend is returned as a named tuple along with the average, maximum, minimum temperature values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,448],"elapsed":7.903386547,"_type":"aimessage"}]
