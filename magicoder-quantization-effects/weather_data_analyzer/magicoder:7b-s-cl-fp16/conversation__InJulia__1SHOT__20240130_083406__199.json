In the solution below, I'm using the `Statistics` package from Julia's standard library which contains functions for calculating various statistical measures like mean, maximum and minimum etc. \n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Check if list is empty\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if max_temp == min_temp\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif max_temp > min_temp\n        trend = :increasing\n    else \n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n\n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function takes a list of daily temperature data `temps` as input and performs the following steps: \n\n1. It checks if the list is empty using `isempty(temps)`. If it's empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n2. If the list is not empty, it calculates the average (`avg`), maximum (`max_temp`) and minimum temperature (`min_temp` of `temps`) using functions from the `Statistics` package.\n3. It then determines the trend based on whether the maximum and minimum temperatures are equal (stable), increasing (max > min) or decreasing (max < min).\n4. Finally, it constructs a named tuple with the calculated values and returns it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,395],"elapsed":6.96199967,"_type":"aimessage"}]
