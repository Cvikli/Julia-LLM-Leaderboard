[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers).

This code uses the Statistics package to get the mean (average), max, and min of the temperatures list. The trend is determined by checking if the temps are all increasing, decreasing or stable. \n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    n = length(temps)\n    \n    # If temp data list is empty, return a named tuple with nothing values for average, max, min and trend\n    if n == 0\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps) # calculate the mean of temps\n    max_temp = maximum(temps) # get the maximum temp\n    min_temp = minimum(temps) # get the minimum temp\n\n    # Determine the trend based on whether or not all temperatures are increasing, decreasing or stable\n    if n < 2\n        trend = :increasing # single temperature list so it's considered increasing\n    elseif temps[1] > temps[n-1] && all(temps[i] > temps[i+1] for i in 1:(n-2))\n        trend = :decreasing # if first element is greater than last then it's decreasing\n    elseif temps[1] < temps[n-1] && all(temps[i] < temps[i+1] for i in 1:(n-2))\n        trend = :increasing # if first element is less than last then it's increasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable # if neither increasing nor decreasing, stable\n    end\n\n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n``` \n\nRemember to add the `Statistics` package by running `using Statistics`.\n\nThis function uses a simple linear scan to determine the trend.
