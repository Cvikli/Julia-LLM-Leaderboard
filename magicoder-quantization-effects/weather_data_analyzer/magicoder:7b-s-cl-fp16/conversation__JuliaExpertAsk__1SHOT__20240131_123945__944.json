Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem in Julia using the Statistics package. Here's how you might write the `weather_data_analyzer` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics: mean, extrema\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        (min_temp, max_temp) = extrema(temps)\n        \n        if max_temp > avg\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif max_temp < avg\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n        \n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the `temps` list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing.\n\nIf the list is not empty, it calculates the average temperature using the `mean` function from the Statistics package. It also finds the minimum and maximum temperatures using the `extrema` function. \n\nThen it checks which of these two conditions holds true: if the maximum temperature is greater than the average, or if it's less. Based on this, it sets the `trend` field in the named tuple to `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`.\n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple with the calculated values for `average`, `max`, `min`, and `trend`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,374],"elapsed":6.486608884,"_type":"aimessage"}]
