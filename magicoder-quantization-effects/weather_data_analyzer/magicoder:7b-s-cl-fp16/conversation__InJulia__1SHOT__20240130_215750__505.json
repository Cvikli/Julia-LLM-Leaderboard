Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia using the `Statistics` package. Firstly, install it by running `Pkg.add(\"Statistics\")` if it isn't installed already.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        average = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if length(unique(diff([max_temp; temps]))) == 1 && max_temp > temps[1]\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif length(unique(diff([min_temp; temps]))) == 1 && min_temp < temps[1]\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n        \n        return (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function works by first checking if the list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package. It then checks the trend by comparing the first element of the list with the maximum and minimum temperature. If they are both greater or smaller than the first element, it means that the trend is increasing or decreasing respectively. Otherwise, it means that the trend is stable. Finally, it returns a named tuple containing these values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,387],"elapsed":6.696222523,"_type":"aimessage"}]
