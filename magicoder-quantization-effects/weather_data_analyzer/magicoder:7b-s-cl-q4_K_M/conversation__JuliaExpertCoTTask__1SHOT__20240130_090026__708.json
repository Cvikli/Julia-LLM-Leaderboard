When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you could write this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    trend_str = \"\"\n    if length(temps) < 2\n        trend_str = \"stable\"\n    elseif temps[1] < temps[2]\n        trend_str = \"increasing\"\n    elseif temps[1] > temps[2]\n        trend_str = \"decreasing\"\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend_str)\nend\n```\nThis function works as follows: it first checks if the list is empty. If so, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average (`avg`), maximum (`max_temp`), and minimum (`min_temp`) temperatures using functions from the `Statistics` package.\n\nThe function then determines the trend by comparing the first two values in the list. If the first value is less than the second one, it sets the trend to `:increasing`. If the first value is greater, it sets the trend to `:decreasing`. If there are fewer than 2 temperatures, it defaults to setting the trend to `:stable`.\n\nFinally, it constructs and returns a named tuple with all of these values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,383],"elapsed":3.132639931,"_type":"aimessage"}]
