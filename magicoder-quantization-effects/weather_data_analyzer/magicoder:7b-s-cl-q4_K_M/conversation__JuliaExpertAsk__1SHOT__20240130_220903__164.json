Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can implement this in Julia. Firstly, install the Statistics package if it's not already installed by using `Pkg.add(\"Statistics\")`.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Check if list is empty\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    trend = ifelse(avg > temps[1], :increasing, (avg < temps[1]) ? :decreasing : :stable)\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first checking if the list is empty. If it is, a named tuple with all values set to `nothing` is returned. If not, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the Statistics package. It then determines the trend based on whether the average temperature is greater than or less than the first temperature in the list (assuming that the list represents daily temperatures where earlier days are more relevant). Finally, it constructs and returns a named tuple with these values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,324],"elapsed":2.561379483,"_type":"aimessage"}]
