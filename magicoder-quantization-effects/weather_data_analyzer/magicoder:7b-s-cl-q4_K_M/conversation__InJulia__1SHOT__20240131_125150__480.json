First, we need to import the Statistics package. Then we can define our function `weather_data_analyzer` which takes as input the list of daily temperature data and returns a named tuple with the requested statistical information:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    trend = ifelse(max_temp > min_temp, :increasing, \n                   ifelse(min_temp > max_temp, :decreasing, :stable))\n    \n    return (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list of daily temperature data is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf not, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures using functions from the Statistics package. It then determines the trend based on whether the maximum temperature is greater than the minimum or vice versa. Finally, it constructs and returns a named tuple with these statistical results.","status":200,"tokens":[0,316],"elapsed":2.520636421,"_type":"aimessage"}]
