Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use the following Julia code to solve this problem. We are using the `Statistics` package to perform statistical analyses on our data. The function `weather_data_analyzer` will first check if the input list is empty, and if it is, it will return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. If the input list is not empty, then it will use the `Statistics` package to calculate the average, maximum, minimum temperatures, and trend.\n\nHere's how you can do this:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; \n               average = nothing, \n               max     = nothing, \n               min     = nothing, \n               trend   = nothing)\n    else\n        average = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        if all(x -> x <= 0, diff(temps))\n            trend = :decreasing\n        elseif all(x -> x >= 0, diff(temps))\n            trend = :increasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n        \n        return (; average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn the code above, we first check if `temps` is empty. If it's not, we calculate the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` of the list using the functions from the `Statistics` package. We then use a simple logic to determine what trend the data is showing by checking whether all the differences are positive or negative.\n\nWe return these values in a named tuple. If `temps` was empty, we return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,423],"elapsed":3.459050314,"_type":"aimessage"}]
