Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you could solve this problem in Julia. Note that we use the `Statistics` package for statistical operations and the `NamedTuple` type for constructing the response:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if length(unique(diff([0; temps]))) == 1\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif diff([0; temps])[2] > 0\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks whether the list of temperatures is empty. If it's not, it calculates the average and maximum/minimum temperature values using `mean` and `extrema` functions respectively from `Statistics` package. It then determines the trend based on changes in consecutive days.\n\nYou can test this function with a list of daily temperatures:\n```julia\ntemps = [23, 25, 27, 28, 29, 30, 27, 26, 24]\nprint(weather_data_analyzer(temps))\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,364],"elapsed":2.917124027,"_type":"aimessage"}]
