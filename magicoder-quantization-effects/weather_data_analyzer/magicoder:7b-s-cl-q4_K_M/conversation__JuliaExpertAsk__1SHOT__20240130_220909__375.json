Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia. Firstly, you need to install the Statistics package if it isn't installed yet using Pkg.add(\"Statistics\"). \n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        trend = ifelse(avg > max_temp, :decreasing, (avg < min_temp ? :increasing : :stable))\n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the `temps` list is empty. If it's empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the Statistics package respectively. It then determines the trend of the data based on whether the average temperature is greater than the maximum or lesser than the minimum.\n\nYou can call this function with a list of daily temperature data like so:\n```julia\ntemps = [23, 25, 20, 26, 21, 24]\nresult = weather_data_analyzer(temps)\nprintln(\"Average: $(result.average), Max: $(result.max), Min: $(result.min), Trend: $(result.trend)\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,386],"elapsed":3.062374115,"_type":"aimessage"}]
