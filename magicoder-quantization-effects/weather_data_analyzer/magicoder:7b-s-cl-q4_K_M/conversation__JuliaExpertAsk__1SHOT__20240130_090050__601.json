Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's one way you could do this in Julia using the `Statistics` standard library package. \n\n```julia\nusing Statistics: mean, maximum, minimum\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n        minTemp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        trend = ifelse(maxTemp - avg > 0, :increasing, \n                       ifelse(avg - maxTemp > 0, :decreasing, :stable))\n        \n        return (; average=avg, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThe function `weather_data_analyzer` takes a list of daily temperature data as input and uses the `Statistics.jl` package to calculate the mean (`mean`), maximum (`maximum`), and minimum temperatures. It then determines the trend by comparing the maximum temperature with the average, and returns these results in a named tuple. If the list is empty, it returns `nothing` for all fields of the named tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,286],"elapsed":2.314147741,"_type":"aimessage"}]
