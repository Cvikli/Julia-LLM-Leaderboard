Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's how you might write this code in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    n = length(temps)\n\n    # Check if the list is empty.

If the input list is empty, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing.\n- The trend is determined by comparing the average temperature with the first value in the list. If the average is greater than or equal to the first element, it's considered an increasing trend; if the average is less than the first element, it's a decreasing trend; otherwise, it's stable (same as the first value).","status":200,"tokens":[0,392],"elapsed":3.205278371,"_type":"aimessage"}]
