Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can write this function in Julia using the Statistics package.\n\nFirstly, add the Statistics package by running the following command:\n```julia\nusing Pkg; Pkg.add(\"Statistics\")\n```\nThen define your function as follows:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n    minTemp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Determine the trend based on the first two elements in the list.\n    if temps[1] < temps[2]\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif temps[1] > temps[2]\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=average, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list is empty. If it's empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. \n\nIf the list isn't empty, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures by using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the Statistics package respectively. \n\nThe trend is determined based on the first two elements in the list. If the first element is less than the second one, the function sets the trend to `:increasing`. If the first element is greater than the second one, the function sets the trend to `:decreasing`. Otherwise, if both the first and second elements are equal, the function sets the trend to `:stable`. \n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple with all these values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,426],"elapsed":3.416627312,"_type":"aimessage"}]
