Note that we need to import the Statistics package and use its functions for calculating the average, maximum, minimum, etc.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n    minTemp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if average > maxTemp\n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif average < minTemp\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=average, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list is empty. If it's empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the Statistics package. It then determines the trend based on whether the average is greater than or less than the maximum or minimum temperature respectively. Finally, it returns a named tuple containing these calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,300],"elapsed":2.360463943,"_type":"aimessage"}]
