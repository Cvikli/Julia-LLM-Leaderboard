Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package).

Note that we are using the `Statistics` package for calculating the average and other statistical measures:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if avg > max_temp || avg < min_temp\n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif avg == max_temp && avg == min_temp\n        trend = :stable\n    else \n        trend = :increasing\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function works by first checking if the list of temperatures is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf the list is not empty, it calculates the average temperature, maximum and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package respectively. It then checks if the average temperature is greater than or lesser than either of these two values to determine the trend.\n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple containing the calculated average, maximum and minimum temperatures as well as the trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,352],"elapsed":2.776811287,"_type":"aimessage"}]
