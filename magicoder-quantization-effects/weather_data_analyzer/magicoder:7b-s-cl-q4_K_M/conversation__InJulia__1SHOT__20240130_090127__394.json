[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can achieve this by using the `Statistics.jl` package in Julia which provides functions for statistical computations. Here is how you can accomplish it:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n        minTemp = minimum(temps)\n        trend_symbol = ifelse(avg < maxTemp, :increasing,\n                               ifelse(avg > maxTemp, :decreasing, :stable))\n        return (; average=avg, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend_symbol)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn the above function, firstly check if the list `temps` is empty or not. If it's empty then return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, compute average temperature, maximum and minimum temperatures using statistical functions from the `Statistics.jl` package and determine trend based on whether the average temperature is less than maxTemp (increasing), greater than maxTemp (decreasing) or equal to both (stable). Finally, return a named tuple with computed values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,300],"elapsed":2.414758183,"_type":"aimessage"}]
