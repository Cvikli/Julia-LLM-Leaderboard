Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem using Julia programming language:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if max_temp == min_temp\n            return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:stable)\n        elseif avg > max_temp || avg < min_temp\n            return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:decreasing)\n        else\n            return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:increasing)\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function works as follows. If the list is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average (`avg`), maximum (`max_temp`) and minimum (`min_temp`) temperatures using `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from `Statistics` package. Then it compares these three numbers and sets the trend accordingly: if all are equal, the trend is `:stable`; if average is greater than maximum or less than minimum, it's `:decreasing`; otherwise, it's `:increasing`. The function then returns a named tuple containing these values.","status":200,"tokens":[184,367],"elapsed":2.98010631,"_type":"aimessage"}]
