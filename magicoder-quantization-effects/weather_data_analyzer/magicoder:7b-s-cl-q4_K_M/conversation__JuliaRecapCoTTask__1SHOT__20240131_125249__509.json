[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics  # Import the statistics package for statistical functions\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)   # If list is empty, return named tuple with all values set to nothing\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)  # Calculate the average temperature\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)  # Calculate the maximum temperature\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)  # Calculate the minimum temperature\n        \n        if avg > max_temp\n            trend = :decreasing   # If average is greater than max, then the trend is decreasing\n        elseif avg < min_temp\n            trend = :increasing   # If average is lesser than min, then the trend is increasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable       # If average equals both max and min, then the trend is stable\n        end\n        \n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)   # Return results in named tuple\n    end\nend\n```\nThe `weather_data_analyzer` function first checks if the list of temperatures is empty. If it's empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. If not, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperature using functions from the `Statistics` package. It then determines the trend based on whether the average is greater than or lesser than the maximum and minimum temperatures respectively. Finally, it returns the results in a named tuple.\n\nPlease replace {{instructions}} with your specific instructions if any.","status":200,"tokens":[0,404],"elapsed":3.3391639,"_type":"aimessage"}]
