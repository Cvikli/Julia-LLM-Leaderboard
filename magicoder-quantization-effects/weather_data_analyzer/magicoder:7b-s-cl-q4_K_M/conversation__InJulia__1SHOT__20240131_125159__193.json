Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can create such a function in Julia.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n    minTemp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if average > maxTemp || average < minTemp\n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif average == maxTemp && average == minTemp\n        trend = :stable\n    else\n        trend = :increasing\n    end\n    \n    return (average=average, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nIn this function, we first check if the input list is empty. If it is, we return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, we calculate the mean (average), maximum and minimum temperatures using functions from the Statistics package. Then we determine the trend based on these three temperatures:\n- If the average temperature is greater than either of the max or min temps, it's decreasing. \n- If the average equals both the max and min temps, it's stable (not increasing or decreasing).\n- Otherwise, it must be increasing.\nFinally, we return a named tuple with these calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,324],"elapsed":2.582276329,"_type":"aimessage"}]
