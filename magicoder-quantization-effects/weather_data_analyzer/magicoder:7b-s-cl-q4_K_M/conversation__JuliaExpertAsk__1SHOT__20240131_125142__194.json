Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can implement this in Julia. First, let's import the necessary packages and define our function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # check if list is empty\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    # calculate statistics\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # determine the trend\n    if max_temp == min_temp\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif max_temp > min_temp\n        trend = :increasing\n    else \n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n\n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list of temperatures is empty. If it is, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf the list isn't empty, the function calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperature using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package. It then determines the trend of the data: if the maximum temperature is equal to the minimum temperature, it's considered to be `:stable`. If the maximum temperature is greater than the minimum, it's `:increasing`, otherwise, it's `:decreasing`. \n\nFinally, the function returns a named tuple with the calculated statistics and trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,375],"elapsed":3.013450257,"_type":"aimessage"}]
