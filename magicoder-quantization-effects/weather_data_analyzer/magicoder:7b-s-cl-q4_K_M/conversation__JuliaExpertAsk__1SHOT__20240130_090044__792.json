Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can implement this in Julia as follows:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    trend_arr = diff([0; temps])\n\n    if all(x -> x > 0, trend_arr)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(x -> x < 0, trend_arr)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the `temps` list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. \n\nIf `temps` is not empty, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using functions from Julia's Statistics package. It then determines whether the daily temperature trend (temperature changes from day to day) is increasing, decreasing or stable by creating an array of the differences between consecutive temperatures and checking if all values in this array are positive, negative or zero respectively.\n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple with these calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,337],"elapsed":2.724624498,"_type":"aimessage"}]
