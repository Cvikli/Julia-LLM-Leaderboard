Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is Julia code that solves your problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n    minTemp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if first(temps) < last(temps)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif first(temps) > last(temps)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else \n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (average=avg, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first checking if the list is empty.

If first temperature is greater than last one, the trend is `:decreasing`.
