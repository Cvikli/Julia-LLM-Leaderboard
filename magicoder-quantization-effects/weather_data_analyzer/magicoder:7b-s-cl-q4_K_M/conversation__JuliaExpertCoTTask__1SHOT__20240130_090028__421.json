Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you might write such a function using the Julia programming language:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics # import statistics module\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if avg > max_temp \n            trend = :decreasing\n        elif avg < min_temp\n            trend = :increasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n    \n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this function, we first check if the array `temps` is empty. If it is, we return a named tuple with all values set to nothing. \nIf `temps` is not empty, we calculate the mean (average), maximum and minimum temperatures. The `trend` of the temperature data is determined based on whether the average is greater than or less than either the max or min temp, indicating an increase or decrease respectively. We then return a named tuple containing these values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,296],"elapsed":2.409036235,"_type":"aimessage"}]
