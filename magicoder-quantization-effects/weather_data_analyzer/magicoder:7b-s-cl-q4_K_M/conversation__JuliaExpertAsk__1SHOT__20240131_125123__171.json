Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia. Firstly, we will need the Statistics package which provides functions for basic statistical operations such as mean, maximum, minimum etc.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if max_temp == min_temp\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif max_temp > min_temp\n        trend = :increasing\n    else \n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function will first check if the list of daily temperatures is empty. If it's not, it calculates the mean and maximum/minimum temperature values, then checks for the trend (whether the maximum and minimum temperatures are increasing or decreasing). Finally, it constructs a named tuple with these calculated values and returns it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,283],"elapsed":2.261170744,"_type":"aimessage"}]
