Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia. Firstly, we need to install the Statistics package if it isn't already installed. You can do so by running `]add Statistics` in your Julia console or add it to your Project.toml file:\n\n```julia\n[deps]\nStatsBase = \"https://github.com/JuliaStats/StatsBase.jl#master\"\nStatistics = \"https://github.com/JuliaStats/Statistics.jl#master\"\n```\n\nThen, we can write the `weather_data_analyzer` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if first(temps) < last(temps)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif first(temps) > last(temps)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n        \n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list is empty. If it's empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the Statistics package. It then determines the trend of the temperature data by checking if the first value is less than the last value (indicating an increase), or if the first value is greater than the last value (indicating a decrease). Finally, it returns a named tuple with these calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,433],"elapsed":3.4324584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
