Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could implement this in Julia. Note that I'm assuming you have the Statistics package installed. If not, you can add it using Pkg.add(\"Statistics\").\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    trend = ifelse(avg > first(temps), :increasing, \n                   (avg < first(temps)) ? :decreasing : :stable)\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function works by first checking if the list is empty. If it's empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf the list isn't empty, it calculates the average temperature using the mean() function from the Statistics package, and finds the maximum and minimum temperatures using the maximum() and minimum() functions respectively. It then determines the trend based on whether the average temperature is greater than or less than the first temperature in the list. \n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple containing these calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[184,323],"elapsed":2.587513803,"_type":"aimessage"}]
