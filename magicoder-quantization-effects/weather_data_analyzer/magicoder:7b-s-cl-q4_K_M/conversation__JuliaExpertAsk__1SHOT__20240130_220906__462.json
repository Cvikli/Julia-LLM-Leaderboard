Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia. Firstly, install the Statistics package if it's not already installed by running `]add Statistics` in your Julia REPL. \n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Check if temps is empty\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Determine the trend\n    if first(temps) < last(temps)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif first(temps) > last(temps)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the `temps` list is empty. If it's empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures using `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from Statistics package respectively. \n\nThe trend is determined by comparing the first and last elements of the list. If the first element is less than the last one, then the trend is `:increasing`. If it's greater, then the trend is `:decreasing`. Otherwise, if they are equal, then the trend is `:stable`. \n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple with these calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,387],"elapsed":3.068721469,"_type":"aimessage"}]
