Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an implementation of your requirements using Julia programming language. \n\n```julia\nusing Statistics # Importing necessary packages for statistics analysis\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)::NamedTuple\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps) # Calculating the average temperature\n    max_temp = maximum(temps) # Finding the maximum temperature\n    min_temp = minimum(temps) # Finding the minimum temperature\n\n    if avg < max_temp\n        trend = :increasing \n    elseif avg > max_temp\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function works by first checking if the `temps` array is empty. If it is, then the function returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. \n\nOtherwise, it calculates the average temperature using the `mean()` function from the `Statistics` package. It also finds the maximum and minimum temperatures with `maximum()` and `minimum()` functions respectively. \n\nThen it determines the trend of weather data by comparing the average temperature to the maximum (increasing) or the minimum (decreasing). If none of these conditions is met, then the trend is set as stable. The function then returns a named tuple with all computed values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,361],"elapsed":3.554061861,"_type":"aimessage"}]
