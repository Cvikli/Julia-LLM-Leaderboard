Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can solve this problem in Julia. First, import the Statistics package if it's not imported yet:\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n```\nThen define your function:\n```julia\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Check if list is empty and return `nothing` for all values in case of an empty list.\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (;average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps) # calculate average temperature\n    max_temp = maximum(temps) # find the maximum temperature\n    min_temp = minimum(temps) # find the minimum temperature\n\n    if average > max_temp\n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif average < min_temp\n        trend = :increasing\n    else \n        trend = :stable\n    end # end of if-else statement\n    \n    return (;average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend) # return the named tuple\nend # end of function definition\n```\nYou can now call this function with your data:\n```julia\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,309],"elapsed":3.060970391,"_type":"aimessage"}]
