Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can write this function in Julia.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if avg > max_temp\n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif avg < min_temp\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nIn this function:\n- We first check if the list of temperatures is empty. If it is, we return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n- If the list isn't empty, we calculate the average (`avg`), maximum (`max_temp`) and minimum (`min_temp`) temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package.\n- We then determine the trend based on whether the average is greater than or less than the max/min temperature. If it's greater, we set the trend to `:decreasing`. If it's less, we set the trend to `:increasing`. Otherwise, if the average equals all other temperatures, we set the trend to `:stable`.\n- Finally, we return a named tuple containing the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,369],"elapsed":3.52318539,"_type":"aimessage"}]
