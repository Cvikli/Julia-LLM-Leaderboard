Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you could implement this in Julia. Firstly, you need to install the Statistics package if it isn't already installed by using the Pkg module:\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"Statistics\")\n```\nThen you can use the following function:\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        average = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if average > max_temp\n            trend = :decreasing\n        elseif average < min_temp\n            trend = :increasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n        \n        return (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures from the list using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the Statistics package respectively. It then determines the trend based on whether the average temperature is greater than or less than either of the extreme values in the list. Finally, it returns a named tuple with these calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,338],"elapsed":3.22830542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
