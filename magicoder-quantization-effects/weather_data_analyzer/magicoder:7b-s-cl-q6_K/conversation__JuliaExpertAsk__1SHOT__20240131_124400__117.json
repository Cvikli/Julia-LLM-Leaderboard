Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can write this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    trend_symbol = ifelse(avg > max_temp, :decreasing, \n                          avg < min_temp ? :increasing : :stable)\n    \n    return (; average = avg, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = trend_symbol)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the input list `temps` is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf `temps` is not empty, it calculates the average (`avg`), maximum (`max_temp`), and minimum (`min_temp`) temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package.\n\nThe function then determines the trend based on these three values. If the average temperature is greater than the maximum, it's a `:decreasing` trend. If the average is lesser than the minimum, it's an `:increasing` trend. Otherwise, if none of these conditions are met, the trend is considered `:stable`.\n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple with the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,358],"elapsed":3.444204442,"_type":"aimessage"}]
