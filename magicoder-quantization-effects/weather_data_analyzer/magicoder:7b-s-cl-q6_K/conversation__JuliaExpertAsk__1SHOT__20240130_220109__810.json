Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem using Julia. Firstly, we need to install the Statistics package if it isn't already installed. You can do that by running `Pkg.add(\"Statistics\")` in your Julia console. \n\nNow let's write our function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Check if the list is empty\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    # Calculate statistics\n    stats = (; \n        average=mean(temps), \n        max=maximum(temps), \n        min=minimum(temps)\n    )\n    \n    # Determine the trend\n    if stats.max - stats.average > 0\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif stats.max - stats.average < 0\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    # Return the results in a named tuple\n    return (; average=stats.average, max=stats.max, min=stats.min, trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list is empty and returns `nothing` for all statistics if it is. If the list isn't empty, it calculates the mean (`average`), maximum (`max`), and minimum (`min`) of the temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the Statistics package.\n\nThen it determines the trend by checking if the maximum temperature is higher than the average temperature (increasing), lower than the average temperature (decreasing), or equal to the average temperature (stable). \n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple containing these statistics and trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,421],"elapsed":4.029790017,"_type":"aimessage"}]
