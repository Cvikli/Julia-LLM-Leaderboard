Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this task using Julia's built-in `Statistics` package. Here is the solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Return a named tuple with all values set to nothing if the list is empty\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    # Calculate average, maximum and minimum temperatures\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Determine the trend based on the difference between consecutive days' temperature\n    diffs = diff([min_temp; max_temp])\n    if all(difference -> difference > 0, diffs), :increasing elseif all(difference -> difference < 0, diffs), :decreasing else :stable end\n\n    # Return the named tuple\n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThe `weather_data_analyzer` function first checks if the list is empty. If it is, it creates a named tuple with all values set to nothing. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures. The trend is determined by checking whether each day's temperature is higher than the previous one or lower. If it is always higher (increasing), if it is always lower (decreasing), otherwise (stable). The function then returns a named tuple with these values.\n\nYou can call this function with your data:\n\n```julia\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,410],"elapsed":4.064848764,"_type":"aimessage"}]
