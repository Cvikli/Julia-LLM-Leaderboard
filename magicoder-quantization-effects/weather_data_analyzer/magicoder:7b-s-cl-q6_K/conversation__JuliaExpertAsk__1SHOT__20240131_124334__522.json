Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem using Julia. Note that you need to install the Statistics package in order to use statistical functions. You can do so by running `]add Statistics` in your Julia REPL.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    maxT = maximum(temps)\n    minT = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if maxT == minT\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif maxT > minT\n        trend = :increasing\n    else \n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=maxT, min=minT, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list `temps` is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. Otherwise, it calculates the average (`avg`), maximum (`maxT`) and minimum (`minT`) temperatures using the mean and extrema functions from the Statistics package. It then determines the `trend` based on whether the maximum temperature is greater than or less than the minimum temperature. Finally, it returns a named tuple with these values.","status":200,"tokens":[184,315],"elapsed":3.058535077,"_type":"aimessage"}]
