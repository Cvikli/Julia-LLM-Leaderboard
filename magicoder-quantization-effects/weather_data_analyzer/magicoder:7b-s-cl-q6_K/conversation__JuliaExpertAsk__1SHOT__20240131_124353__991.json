Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can implement this in Julia using the Statistics package. This code will calculate the average, maximum and minimum temperature from the given list, then determine if the temperatures are increasing, decreasing or stable.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics: mean, extrema, max, min\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    nt = (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    \n    if isempty(temps)\n        return nt\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    maxT, minT = extrema(temps)\n    trend_symbol = \"\"\n\n    if avg > maxT \n        trend_symbol = \":decreasing\"\n    elseif avg < minT\n        trend_symbol = \":increasing\"\n    else\n        trend_symbol = \":stable\"\n    end\n\n    return (; average=avg, max=maxT, min=minT, trend=trend_symbol)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. Then, it calculates the mean of the temperatures and finds the maximum and minimum temperatures. It then determines the trend based on whether the average temperature is greater than the maximum, less than the minimum or equal to both. Finally, it constructs and returns a named tuple with the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,336],"elapsed":3.231557038,"_type":"aimessage"}]
