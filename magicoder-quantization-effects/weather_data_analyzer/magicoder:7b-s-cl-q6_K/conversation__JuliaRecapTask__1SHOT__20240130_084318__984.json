[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers).

If the list is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing.\n\nIt first checks if the list is empty using the `isempty(temps)` check. If so, it constructs and returns a named tuple with appropriate placeholder values.\n\nIf the list is not empty, it calculates the average temperature by summing up all temperatures in the list and dividing by the number of elements in the list (found using the `length(temps)` function). It also finds the maximum (`maxT`) and minimum (`minT`) temperatures.\n\nNext, it compares the maximum temperature with the average to determine the trend. If the maximum temperature is greater than the average, the trend is set to `:increasing`. If the maximum temperature is less than the average, the trend is set to `:decreasing`. Otherwise, if both the maximum and average temperatures are equal, the trend is set to `:stable`.\n\nFinally, it constructs and returns a named tuple containing the `average`, `max` (maximum temperature), `min` (minimum temperature) and `trend`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,447],"elapsed":4.456762116,"_type":"aimessage"}]
