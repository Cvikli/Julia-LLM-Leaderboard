Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        maximum = maximum(temps)\n        minimum = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if avg > maximum || avg < minimum\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif avg < maximum && avg > minimum\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n    \n        return (average=avg, max=maximum, min=minimum, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nYou can use this function with your example like:\n```julia\ntemps = [25, 27, 23, 20, 22]\nweather_data_analyzer(temps)\n```\nThis will return a named tuple containing the average, maximum and minimum temperatures along with the trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,258],"elapsed":2.554609902,"_type":"aimessage"}]
