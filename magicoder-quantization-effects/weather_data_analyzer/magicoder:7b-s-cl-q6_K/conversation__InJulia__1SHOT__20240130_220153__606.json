Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`).

If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf the list is not empty, it calculates the average temperature, maximum and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the Statistics package respectively. It then checks if the average temperature is greater than or less than both the maximum and minimum temperatures to determine the trend. \n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple with the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,330],"elapsed":3.140398952,"_type":"aimessage"}]
