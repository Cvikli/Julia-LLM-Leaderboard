[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem, you can use the following Julia code:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)::NamedTuple\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n    minTemp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    trendSymbol = nothing\n    if avg < first(temps)\n        trendSymbol = :decreasing\n    elseif avg > last(temps)\n        trendSymbol = :increasing\n    else\n        trendSymbol = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trendSymbol)\nend\n```\n\nThis code first checks if the list of temperatures is empty. If it is, it returns a NamedTuple with all fields set to nothing. \n\nIf the list has elements, it calculates the average temperature and the maximum and minimum values using functions from the Statistics package. It then determines the trend based on whether the average temperature is less than or greater than the first or last temperature in the list, respectively. \n\nFinally, it returns a NamedTuple with all the calculated statistics and the determined trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,313],"elapsed":3.111489254,"_type":"aimessage"}]
