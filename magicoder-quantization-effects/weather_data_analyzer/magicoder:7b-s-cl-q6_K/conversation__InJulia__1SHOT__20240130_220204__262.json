Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package).

If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia. \n\nFirstly, install the Statistics package if it isn't already installed by running `Pkg.add(\"Statistics\")` in your Julia console or REPL.\n\nHere is a possible solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Check if list of temps is empty\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    # Calculate average, maximum and minimum temperatures\n    avg_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Determine the trend of temperature data\n    if length(temps) < 2\n        return (average=avg_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    diffs = diff(temps)\n    if all(x -> x > 0, diffs)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(x -> x < 0, diffs)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=avg_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list of temperatures is empty. If it's not, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures, then determines the trend based on whether the differences between consecutive days are all positive, all negative or mixed. The results are returned in a named tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,397],"elapsed":3.766107612,"_type":"aimessage"}]
