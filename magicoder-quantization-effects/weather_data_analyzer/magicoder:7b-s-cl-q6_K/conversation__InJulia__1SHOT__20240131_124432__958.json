Note that you need to install the Statistics package via Pkg.add(\"Statistics\") if it's not already installed. \n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        average = mean(temps)\n        maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n        minTemp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if average > maxTemp\n            trend = :decreasing\n        elseif average < minTemp\n            trend = :increasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n\n        return (average=average, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list of temperatures is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\nIf the list is not empty, it calculates the average temperature and the maximum and minimum temperatures. It then determines the trend based on whether the average temperature is greater than or less than both the maximum and minimum temperatures. \n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple with these values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,303],"elapsed":2.911172825,"_type":"aimessage"}]
