Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia solution for the problem. In this code, we use the `Statistics` package to calculate mean, maximum and minimum temperatures. We check if temperature data is increasing or decreasing by comparing consecutive elements in the list. The function will return appropriate trend based on these comparisons.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Check if temps array is empty\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    mean = mean(temps)\n    maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n    minTemp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Calculate trend based on temperature difference\n    diffs = map((x, y)->y-x, temps[1:end-1], temps[2:end])\n    \n    if all(d -> d > 0, diffs)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(d -> d < 0, diffs)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    # Return results as a named tuple\n    return (; average=mean, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nTest the function with some sample data:\n```julia\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n```\nThis should return a named tuple with average temperature as `24.4`, maximum temperature as `27` and minimum temperature as `20`.
