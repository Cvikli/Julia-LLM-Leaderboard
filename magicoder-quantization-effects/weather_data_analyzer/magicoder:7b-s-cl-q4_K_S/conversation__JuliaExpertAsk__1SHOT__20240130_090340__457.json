Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example Julia function that performs statistical analyses on the daily temperature data. Note that we use `Statistics` package for average, max and min calculations. For trend calculation, we simply compare the first and last temperatures of the list:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    first_temp = temps[1]\n    last_temp = temps[end]\n\n    if first_temp > last_temp\n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif first_temp < last_temp\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function takes a list of daily temperatures as input and returns a named tuple with statistical data. If the list is empty, it will return `nothing` for all values.
