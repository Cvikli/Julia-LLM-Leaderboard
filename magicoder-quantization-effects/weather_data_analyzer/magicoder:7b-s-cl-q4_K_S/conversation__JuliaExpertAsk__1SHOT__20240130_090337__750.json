Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you might implement this in Julia. \n\nFirstly, let's import the necessary package:\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n```\nNext, define your function:\n```julia\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        trend_symbol = ifelse(avg > first(temps), \":increasing\",\n                                avg < first(temps) ? \":decreasing\" : \":stable\")\n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, \n                trend=Symbol(trend_symbol))\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this code block, `isempty` function is used to check if the list is empty or not. If it's empty, then a named tuple with all values set to nothing is returned. Otherwise, mean and maximum/minimum temperatures are calculated using `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package. The trend of the temperature data is determined by checking if average temperature is greater than or lesser than initial temperature in the list. Depending on this comparison result, different symbolic trend type is returned as a string using `ifelse`.\n\nNow you can call your function with the list:\n```julia\ntemps = [25, 30, 26, 21, 29, 24] # example temperature data list\nresult = weather_data_analyzer(temps)\nprintln(\"Average: $(result.average), Maximum: $(result.max), Minimum: $(result.min), Trend: $(result.trend)\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,433],"elapsed":3.402410135,"_type":"aimessage"}]
