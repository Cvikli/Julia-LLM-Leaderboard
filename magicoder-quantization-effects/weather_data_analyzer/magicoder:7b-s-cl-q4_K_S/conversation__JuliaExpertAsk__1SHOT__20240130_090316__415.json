Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can write this function. Firstly, install the Statistics package if it isn't already installed:\n```julia\nusing Pkg; Pkg.add(\"Statistics\")\n```\nThen, define your function `weather_data_analyzer`:\n```julia\nusing Statistics \n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    trend = ifelse(first(temps) > last(temps), :decreasing, \n                    first(temps) < last(temps) ? :increasing : :stable )\n    \n    return (avg=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function works as follows: If the `temps` list is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. Otherwise, it calculates the average (`avg`), maximum (`max`) and minimum (`min`) temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the Statistics package, respectively. Then, it checks if the first temperature is greater than the last one (indicating a decreasing trend), if they are equal (steady weather), or lesser than the first (increasing trend). Finally, it returns all these results in a named tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,345],"elapsed":2.720860069,"_type":"aimessage"}]
