Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation in Julia. This uses the Statistics package for easy computation of mean, min, and max. It then checks if any two consecutive days have a positive temperature difference (indicating an increase) or negative difference (indicating a decrease).\n\n```julia\nusing DataStructures: NamedTuple\nimport Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return NamedTuple{(:average, :max, :min, :trend)}(nothing for _ in 1:4)\n    else\n        avg = Statistics.mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if length(temps) < 2\n            return NamedTuple{(:average, :max, :min, :trend)}((avg, max_temp, min_temp, nothing))\n        end\n    \n        trend = ifelse(temps[1] - temps[2] > 0, \":increasing\",\n            ifelse(temps[1] - temps[2] < 0, \":decreasing\", \":stable\"))\n        \n        return NamedTuple{(:average, :max, :min, :trend)}((avg, max_temp, min_temp, trend))\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThe `ifelse` function is used here instead of an `if-else` statement to avoid nested conditions. The `isempty` function is used to check if the list is empty and return a NamedTuple with all values set to nothing if it is, otherwise calculate and return a named tuple containing the average, maximum, minimum temperature, and trend based on the difference in consecutive temperatures.","status":200,"tokens":[0,394],"elapsed":3.102648079,"_type":"aimessage"}]
