Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you might approach this problem using the Julia programming language. This solution uses the Statistics package to compute the mean, min and max temperatures:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        \n        if min_temp == max_temp \n            return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:stable)\n        elseif min_temp < avg < max_temp \n            return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:increasing)\n        else\n            return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:decreasing)\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function works as follows. If the array `temps` is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. Otherwise, it calculates the average, minimum and maximum temperatures from the list of daily temperature data, and determines if the temperature trends are increasing (`:increasing`), decreasing (`:decreasing`) or stable (`:stable`). \n\nTo test this function with your given example, you can use:\n```julia\ntemps = [25, 27, 23, 20, 22]\nweather_data_analyzer(temps)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,385],"elapsed":3.513122156,"_type":"aimessage"}]
