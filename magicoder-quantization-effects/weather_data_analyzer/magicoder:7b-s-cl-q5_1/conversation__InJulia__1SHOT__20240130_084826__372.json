Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can write such a function in Julia using the Statistics package:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n\n    if min_temp == max_temp\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif min_temp < max_temp\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n    \n    return (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function calculates the average and extremes of the provided temperature data list. If the temperature list is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. Otherwise, it calculates the min and max temps and checks if they are equal or not. Based on that, it assigns an appropriate trend value to the returned result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,263],"elapsed":2.35957109,"_type":"aimessage"}]
