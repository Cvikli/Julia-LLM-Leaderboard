Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia programming language, you can solve this problem by using the built-in statistics package and constructing a function. Here is a simple solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    elseif all(temp -> temp >= first(temps), temps) && all(temp -> temp <= last(temps), temps)\n        average_temp = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        trend_temp = ifelse(max_temp > min_temp, :increasing, (:equal == nothing ? :decreasing : :stable))\n        return (average = average_temp, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = trend_temp)\n    else \n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = :increasing)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function will return the average, maximum and minimum temperatures in a named tuple. It also determines whether the temperature trends are increasing, decreasing or stable. If all temps are greater than or equal to the first temp and less than or equal to the last temp (i.e., no dips or peaks), then it will classify the temperature as \"stable\", otherwise it will classify the temperature as \"increasing\".\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that input is a list of real numbers, not temperatures which can be negative.","status":200,"tokens":[0,363],"elapsed":3.306842632,"_type":"aimessage"}]
