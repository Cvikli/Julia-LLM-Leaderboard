Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could implement the function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if avg > max_temp\n            trend = :decreasing\n        elseif avg < min_temp\n            trend = :increasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n        return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n``` \n\nThis function first checks whether the list is empty. If it is, the function returns a named tuple with `nothing` values for all fields. \n\nIf the list is not empty, the function calculates the average (`avg`), maximum (`max_temp`), and minimum (`min_temp`) temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package respectively. \n\nThe `trend` field of the named tuple is then determined by comparing `avg` with both `max_temp` and `min_temp`. If `avg` > `max_temp`, the function sets `trend` to `:decreasing`; if `avg` < `min_temp`, it sets `trend` to `:increasing`; otherwise, it sets `trend` to `:stable`. \n\nFinally, the function returns a named tuple containing the calculated values for `average`, `max`, `min`, and `trend`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,401],"elapsed":3.653763179,"_type":"aimessage"}]
