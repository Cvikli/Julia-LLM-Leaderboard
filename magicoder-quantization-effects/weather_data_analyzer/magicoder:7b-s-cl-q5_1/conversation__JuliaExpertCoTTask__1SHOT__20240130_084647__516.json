Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is the solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nstruct WeatherDataAnalyzerResult\n    average::Union{Float64,Nothing}\n    max::Union{Float64,Nothing}\n    min::Union{Float64,Nothing}\n    trend::Union{Symbol,Nothing}\nend\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return WeatherDataAnalyzerResult(nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        diffs = [abs(t - avg) for t in temps]\n        trend = ifelse(all(diff .>= 0.0), :increasing, \n                      ifelse(all(diff .<= 0.0), :decreasing, :stable))\n        \n        return WeatherDataAnalyzerResult(avg, max_temp, min_temp, trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the array is empty; if it is, it returns a `WeatherDataAnalyzerResult` with all values set to `nothing`. If the array isn't empty, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperature using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions respectively. It also computes a \"trend\" by checking if all differences between temperatures and their average are positive, negative or zero; this is done using an array comprehension and conditional logic. Finally, it returns the named tuple with these calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[323,372],"elapsed":5.123240818,"_type":"aimessage"}]
