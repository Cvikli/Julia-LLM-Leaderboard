Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could define this function in Julia. \n\n```julia\nusing Statistics: mean, extrema\nusing DataStructures: NamedTuple\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Return a tuple with nothing values if the list is empty\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    (minimum, maximum) = extrema(temps)\n    \n    # Determine the temperature trend\n    if maximum > minimum\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif maximum < minimum\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n  \n    return (; average=average, max=maximum, min=minimum, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThe function `weather_data_analyzer` calculates the mean and extremes of a list of daily temperatures. It then determines the temperature trend based on whether the maximum or minimum temperature is higher than the other one. If the list is empty, it returns a tuple with nothing values for all fields.\n  \nNote: The `Statistics` package provides the `mean` and `extrema` functions, which compute the mean (average) and extremes (minimum and maximum) of data respectively. The `DataStructures` package is used to create a named tuple using the `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax.","status":200,"tokens":[0,359],"elapsed":3.270511056,"_type":"aimessage"}]
