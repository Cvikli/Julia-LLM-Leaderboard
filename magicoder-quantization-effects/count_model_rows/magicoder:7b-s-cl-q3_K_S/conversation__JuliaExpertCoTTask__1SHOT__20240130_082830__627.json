The result is converted into a DataFrame for easy viewing.\n\nYou can now call this function on your dataframe:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\ncount_rows = count_model_rows(df_cars)\ndisplay(count_rows)\n```\nThe output will be a DataFrame with the model names as the column headers and counts of rows for each model as values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,240],"elapsed":1.903500291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
