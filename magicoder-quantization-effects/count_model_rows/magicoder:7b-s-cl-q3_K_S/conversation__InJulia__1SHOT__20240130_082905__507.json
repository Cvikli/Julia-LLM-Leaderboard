The `groupby` function from the DataFrames.jl package groups the DataFrame based on a given column (in this case `:model`). The `nrow` function calculates the number of rows in each group.\n\nPlease remember to import the necessary modules at the beginning of your script, such as DataFrames and CounterUtils before defining the function.","status":200,"tokens":[59,184],"elapsed":1.489158642,"_type":"aimessage"}]
