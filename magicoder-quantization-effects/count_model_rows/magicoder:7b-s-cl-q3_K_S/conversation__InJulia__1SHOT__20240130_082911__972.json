This dataframe has a column named 'model':\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    groupby(df, :model) |> \n    summarise(:n=length)\nend\n\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nHere, we are grouping by the 'model' column of the DataFrame and then calculating the number of rows in each group using the `length` function. The result is a new dataframe that shows for each unique value in the 'model' column, how many rows there are with this model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,173],"elapsed":1.363619098,"_type":"aimessage"}]
