For each model it counts how many rows there are in the corresponding group and stores this value in a new DataFrame `count_data`. The final result is presented as another DataFrame where each row corresponds to a model and its count of rows in the original data frame.\n  \nYou may call this function like: \n```julia\ncounted_rows = count_model_rows(df_cars)\ndisplay(counted_rows)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,298],"elapsed":2.367344314,"_type":"aimessage"}]
