Then for each group, we calculate the number of rows using `nrow` and store them in a Vector. Finally, we return these counts as a Dictionary where keys are models and values are the corresponding row numbers.\n\nHere is how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,262],"elapsed":2.072136444,"_type":"aimessage"}]
