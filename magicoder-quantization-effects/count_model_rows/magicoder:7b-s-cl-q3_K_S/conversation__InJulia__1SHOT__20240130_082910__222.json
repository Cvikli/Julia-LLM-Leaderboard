The function should look something like this:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, CategoricalArrays\n\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model = [\"Ford\", \"Toyota\", \"Honda\", \"Honda\", \"Ford\"])\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = nrow.(grouped)\n    \n    for (k, v) in zip(keys(counts), values(counts))\n        println(\"$k: $v\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `count_model_rows` that accepts a DataFrame as an argument. The DataFrame is then grouped by the 'model' column using the `groupby` method, and for each group of rows with the same model, it calculates the number of rows in this group using the `nrow` function and stores these counts in an array.\nAfter that we iterate over keys and values of our resultant dictionary and print them. The `keys` and `values` functions are used to get the keys and values from the grouped data.","status":200,"tokens":[0,274],"elapsed":2.163638197,"_type":"aimessage"}]
