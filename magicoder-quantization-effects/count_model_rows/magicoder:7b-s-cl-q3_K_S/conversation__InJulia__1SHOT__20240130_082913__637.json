Then it calculates the number of rows in each group using nrow and returns these counts as a new DataFrame where the rows correspond to different models and columns represent individual counts for each model.\n\nYou can call this function like:\n```julia\ndf_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\ndisplay(df_counts)\n```\nThis will display a table with the number of rows per `model` from `df_cars`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,200],"elapsed":1.58237188,"_type":"aimessage"}]
