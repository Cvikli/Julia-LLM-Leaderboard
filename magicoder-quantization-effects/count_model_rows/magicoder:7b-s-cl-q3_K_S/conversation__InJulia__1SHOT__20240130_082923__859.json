The result is a Vector of Integers, where the i-th element corresponds to the number of rows for the i-th unique model.\n\nNote: If you want the function to return a DataFrame instead of a Vector of integers (where each row represents a unique model and its count), then you could modify this function like so:\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = nrow.(grouped)\n    return DataFrame(:model => names(df)[1], :count => counts)\nend\n```\nIn this version of the function, a DataFrame is returned where each row represents a unique model and its count. The ':model' column contains the unique models, and the ':count' column contains the number of rows for that model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,294],"elapsed":2.295336231,"_type":"aimessage"}]
