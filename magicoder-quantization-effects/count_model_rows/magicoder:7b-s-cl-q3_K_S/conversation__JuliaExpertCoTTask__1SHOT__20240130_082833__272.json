This function groups by a specified column and then allows you to calculate various statistics for each group.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom typing import Dict\n\ndef count_model_rows(df: pd.DataFrame) -> Dict[str, int]:\n    return df['model'].value_counts().to_dict()\n```\n\nIn the function `count_model_rows`, we use `value_counts()` to calculate counts of each unique value in the 'model' column and convert it into a dictionary.\n\nYou can test this function using:\n```python\ndf_cars = pd.DataFrame(data={'model': ['a4', 'a6', 'a4', 'q7', 'a4']})\nprint(count_model_rows(df_cars))  # Outputs {'a4': 3, 'a6': 1, 'q7': 1}\n```\nThis output means that there are 3 rows with the model 'a4', one row each for models 'a6' and 'q7'.","status":200,"tokens":[0,251],"elapsed":2.004189281,"_type":"aimessage"}]
