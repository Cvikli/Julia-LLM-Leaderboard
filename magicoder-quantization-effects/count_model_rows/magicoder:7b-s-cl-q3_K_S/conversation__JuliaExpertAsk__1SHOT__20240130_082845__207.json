Then, for each group, `nrow` calculates the number of rows in that group and returns them as a vector of integers. This is done using the broadcasting syntax of Julia where you can apply functions to all elements of an array in one line.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThe `counts` variable will be a vector where the i-th element is the number of rows for the i-th model.","status":200,"tokens":[90,212],"elapsed":1.712612864,"_type":"aimessage"}]
