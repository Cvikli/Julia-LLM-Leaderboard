Here's an example of how to implement your function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, DataFramesMeta\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::AbstractDataFrame)\n    gd = groupby(df, :model)  # Group the data by `model` column\n    \n    for subdf in eachrow(gd)\n        rowcount = length(subdf)\n        println(\"Number of rows for $(subdf[1, :model]): $rowcount\")\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function will iterate over the groups and print out the number of rows in each group. You can test it on a DataFrame like this:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFramesMeta\nd = DataFrame(model = [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\"])  # Sample dataframe\ncount_model_rows(d)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,218],"elapsed":1.741175065,"_type":"aimessage"}]
