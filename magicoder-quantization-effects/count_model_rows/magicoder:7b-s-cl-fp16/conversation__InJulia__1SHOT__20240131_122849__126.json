Here is an example of how you could do it:\n\nFirstly, install the necessary packages using Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\") and Pkg.add(\"CSV\").\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped_df = groupby(df, :model)\n    return nrow.(grouped_df)\nend\n```\nIn this function, we first use the `groupby` function to group our dataframe by the 'model' column. Then, using `nrow`, we count how many rows there are for each model in the grouped dataframe. This will return a vector of integers where the i-th integer represents the number of rows for the i-th model.\n\nHere is an example of how you could use this function:\n\n```julia\n# Suppose df_cars is your DataFrame with column 'model'\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nfor (model, count) in zip(unique(df_cars.model), counts)\n    println(\"Model '$model' has $count rows.\")\nend\n```\nThis will print out the number of rows for each unique model in your dataframe.","status":200,"tokens":[0,293],"elapsed":5.056664937,"_type":"aimessage"}]
