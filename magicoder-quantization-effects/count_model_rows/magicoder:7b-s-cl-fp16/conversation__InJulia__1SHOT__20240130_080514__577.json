You can do so using Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\").\n\nHere is a simple function that counts rows by model:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = nrow.(grouped)\n    return counts\nend\n```\nIn this function, we first use the `groupby` function to divide our data into groups based on the \"model\" column. Then, for each of these groups, we calculate the number of rows (using the `nrow` function) and store them in an array called `counts`. This array has one element for each unique value in the \"model\" column - the count of rows for that model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,198],"elapsed":3.430423861,"_type":"aimessage"}]
