Here's an example of a function that does just that:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    # Group by the 'model' column and create a new column with the count of rows for each group\n    df[:count] = [size(group)[1] for group in groupby(df, :model)]\n    \n    return df\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, `groupby` is used to split the DataFrame into groups based on unique values in the 'model' column. Then, a new column 'count' is added to each group that contains the number of rows in that group (which is obtained using `size(group)[1]`). Finally, the modified DataFrame with the additional column is returned.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"A\"], other=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will return a DataFrame where the 'count' column contains the number of rows for each unique value in the 'model' column.","status":200,"tokens":[0,315],"elapsed":5.459308227,"_type":"aimessage"}]
