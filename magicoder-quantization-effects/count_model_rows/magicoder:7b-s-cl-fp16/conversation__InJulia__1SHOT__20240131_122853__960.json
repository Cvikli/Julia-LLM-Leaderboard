Here's how you could do it:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, CategoricalArrays # make sure these packages are imported\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model) # groups by the \"model\" column\n    counts = map(size, grouped)  # apply size function to each group\nend\n```\n\nThis function will return a DataFrame with two columns: `model` (which are the unique values in the original `model` column) and `n` (the number of rows for each model). If you want to get an array instead, you can modify it like this:\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model) \n    counts = map(size, grouped) |> x -> getproperty.(x, 2) # get just the number of rows for each model\nend\n```\n\nThis function will return an array with the count of rows for each unique `model`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,283],"elapsed":4.894194534,"_type":"aimessage"}]
