This function is used to group the DataFrame based on specific column(s) which you want to apply operations on. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    df = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n    return [count(x) for x in eachrow(df)]\nend\n```\nThe function `groupby` groups the DataFrame based on column `:model`. Then it applies the `count` function to each row (`eachrow(df)`), which counts how many rows there are for each group. The resulting list contains count of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,178],"elapsed":3.1464018,"_type":"aimessage"}]
