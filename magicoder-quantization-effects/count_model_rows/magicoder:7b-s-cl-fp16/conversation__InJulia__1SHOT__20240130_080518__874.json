Then, `combine` is used to calculate the number of rows for each group, which is done using `nrow => \"count\" => sum`. This creates a new DataFrame with the counts as a new column named `\"count\"`. \n\nFor example, if you use this function on your DataFrame `df_cars` like:\n```julia\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n`counts` will contain a DataFrame with the models as rows and their respective counts in a new column named `\"count\"`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,218],"elapsed":3.80011886,"_type":"aimessage"}]
