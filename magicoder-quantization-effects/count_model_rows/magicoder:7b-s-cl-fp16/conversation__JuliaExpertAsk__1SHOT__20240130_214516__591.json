Then, we use the `combine` function to calculate the number of rows in each group (i.e., for each unique model). The result is a new dataframe where each row represents a unique model and its count of rows.\n\nYou can call this function with your DataFrame as follows:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", \"A\", \"B\"]) # example dataframe\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[90,221],"elapsed":3.812204229,"_type":"aimessage"}]
