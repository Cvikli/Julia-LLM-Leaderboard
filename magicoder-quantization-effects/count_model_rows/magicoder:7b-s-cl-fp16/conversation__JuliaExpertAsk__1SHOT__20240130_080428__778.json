Here is an example of such function:\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = combine(groupby(grouped), nrow => first) |> rename!(_, \"count\" => :num_rows)\n    return counts\nend\n```\nThis function groups the DataFrame by `:model` and then uses `combine` to calculate the number of rows in each group (which is equivalent to counting all rows for each model). The result is a new DataFrame with columns `model` (grouping variable) and `num_rows` (number of rows per model), which gives the counts as asked.\n\nRemember, this function assumes that your DataFrame's column names are strings, as in `:model`. If they are not, you should replace these symbols with appropriate variables (like `columnname`).","status":200,"tokens":[0,221],"elapsed":3.880468196,"_type":"aimessage"}]
