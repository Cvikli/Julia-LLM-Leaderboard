Then we use `combine` to apply a function that calculates the length of each group which will give us the count of rows for each model. The result is returned as another DataFrame where the index represents unique values from the 'model' column and the \"count\" column shows the number of rows for each model.\n\nNote: This assumes you have at least one row in your dataframe for each value in the 'model' column. If not, you may need to handle this case separately or pre-process your DataFrame to ensure all possible values are present.","status":200,"tokens":[0,243],"elapsed":4.226041816,"_type":"aimessage"}]
