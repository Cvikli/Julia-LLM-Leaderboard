We'll use the `groupby` function from the DataFrames.jl package to group by the 'model' column and then count the number of rows for each group:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = combine(grouped, length, renamecols=x -> Symbol(\"count_\" * string(x)))\n    return counts\nend\n```\n\nYou can use the function like this:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\ndisplay(result)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n| model | count_model |\n|-------|-------------|\n| a4    | 3           |\n| a6    | 1           |\n| q7    | 1           |\n\nThis indicates that there are 3 rows for the 'a4' model, 1 row for the 'a6' model and 1 row for the 'q7' model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,276],"elapsed":4.769992683,"_type":"aimessage"}]
