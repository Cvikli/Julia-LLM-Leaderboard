The `groupby` function groups the data by the 'model' column, then the `combine` function calculates the number of rows in each group (which is equivalent to counting the number of rows per model).\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"A\", \"B\"]) # example dataframe\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(counts)\n```\nThis will output a new DataFrame with the counts of rows for each model:\n\n| model | count |\n|-------|-------|\n| A     | 2     |\n| B     | 2     |\n| C     | 1     |","status":200,"tokens":[0,267],"elapsed":4.603877759,"_type":"aimessage"}]
