Firstly, you need to have the DataFrames package installed in your Julia environment. You can install it using Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\") command if not already installed. \n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    \n    counts = combine(grouped, nrow => \"count\" => sum)\n    \n    return counts\nend\n```\nThis function `count_model_rows` takes a DataFrame as an argument and groups the data by the column 'model'. Then it uses the `combine` function to count the number of rows for each group. The resulting DataFrame contains the unique models in its first column and the corresponding counts in the second column.","status":200,"tokens":[0,175],"elapsed":3.063439931,"_type":"aimessage"}]
