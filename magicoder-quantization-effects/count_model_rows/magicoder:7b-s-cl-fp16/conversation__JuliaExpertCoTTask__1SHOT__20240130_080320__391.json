The solution uses the `groupby` function from the `DataFrames.jl` package to group data by the 'model' column and then counts the rows in each group:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)  # Group the data by model\n    return combine(count, grouped)  # Count the number of rows for each group\nend\n\n# Test the function with your example DataFrame\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\ndisplay(count_model_rows(df_cars))\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will display a new DataFrame that contains the count of rows for each model in your original `df_cars` DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[244,207],"elapsed":8.186146414,"_type":"aimessage"}]
