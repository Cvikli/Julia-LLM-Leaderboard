Here is an example:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    counts = df |>\n        groupby(:model) |>\n        combine(_ -> 1, :model) |>\n        rename(:x1 => :count) |>\n        sort([:model])\n    return counts\nend\n```\nIn this function, we first create a grouped dataframe where the data is grouped by the `model` column. Then, we calculate the number of rows for each group using combine(). The resultant dataframe has one row per group and two columns: `:model` with the model name and `:count` with the count of rows in that model's group. We then sort the resulting dataframe by the `model` column to get it in alphabetical order, as is more standard for a grouped dataframe. \n\nFor example, if you call this function on your DataFrame `df_cars`, like so:\n```julia\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nit will return a new dataframe with the count of rows per model, sorted by model name.","status":200,"tokens":[0,275],"elapsed":4.813224002,"_type":"aimessage"}]
