The `combine` function then calculates the number of rows for each group (`nrow`). \n\nPlease note that you need to install the necessary packages (DataFrames and CategoricalArrays) using Pkg.add(\"PackageName\") before running this code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,212],"elapsed":3.672437371,"_type":"aimessage"}]
