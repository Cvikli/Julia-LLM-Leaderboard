Here is an example of how you could define such a function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = DataFrame(model=String[], count=Int[])\n    \n    for group in grouped\n        push!(counts, DataFrame(model=[group.x], count=[size(group)[1]]))\n    end\n\n    return counts\nend\n```\nThis function first creates a `DataFrameGrouped` object `grouped` from the input `df`. Then it initializes an empty `DataFrame` to store the counts for each model. It iterates over this grouped data, extracts the model name and its count (which is given by the size of the group), and pushes these into the `counts` DataFrame.\n\nHere's how you can use this function with a sample DataFrame:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\"], somecol=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(counts) # prints:  DataFrame[1 row x 2 columns]\n```\n\nThis will display a dataframe with the model names and the number of rows for each.","status":200,"tokens":[0,337],"elapsed":5.891485709,"_type":"aimessage"}]
