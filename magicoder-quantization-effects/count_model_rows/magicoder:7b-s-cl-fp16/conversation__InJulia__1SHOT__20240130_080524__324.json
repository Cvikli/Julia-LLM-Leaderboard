Here is an example of how this problem can be solved:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = combine(grouped, length => (:counts))\nend\n```\nThis function will return a new DataFrame where each row represents a unique model from the input DataFrame and how many rows there are for that model. The `groupby` function groups the input DataFrame by the `:model` column, and then `combine` is used to apply a function (`length`) to every group which returns a count of the number of rows in each group.\n\nYou can use this function like:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"Ford\", \"Toyota\", \"Fiat\", \"Chevrolet\", \"Fiat\", \"Toyota\"], year=[2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020])\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will return a new DataFrame with columns `:model` and `:counts`, where each row represents a unique model from the input DataFrame and how many rows there are for that model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,310],"elapsed":5.40971696,"_type":"aimessage"}]
