Here's how you could define such a function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    return nrow.(grouped)\nend\n```\nThis function takes a DataFrame as input and returns an array of integers. The ith integer in the returned array is the number of rows for the ith group in the DataFrame.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"A\", \"B\"])\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln.(counts)\n```\nThis will output:\n```\n2\n3\n1\n```\nThis means there are 2 rows for the group with model \"A\", 3 rows for the group with model \"B\", and 1 row for the group with model \"C\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,271],"elapsed":4.66684543,"_type":"aimessage"}]
