Here's how you might write your function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = nrow.(grouped)\n    return counts\nend\n```\n\nThis function groups the data by `model` using the `groupby` function from the DataFrames package. It then uses `nrow` to count the number of rows for each group and returns this information in a vector of integers.\n\nWhen you run your example with the given DataFrame:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nYou'll get a result like this:\n\n`2-element Vector{Int64}:`\n`1`\n`3`\n\nThis means there is 1 row for the model 'a6' and 3 rows for the model 'a4'.","status":200,"tokens":[0,253],"elapsed":4.400008878,"_type":"aimessage"}]
