This object groups rows that have the same value in the specified column (in this case, `:model`). Then, we use the `combine` function to calculate the number of rows for each group (`nrow => \"count\"`).\n\nYou can call this function with your DataFrame like so:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"A\", \"B\"]) # example dataframe\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThis will return a new DataFrame with the counts of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,228],"elapsed":3.929840894,"_type":"aimessage"}]
