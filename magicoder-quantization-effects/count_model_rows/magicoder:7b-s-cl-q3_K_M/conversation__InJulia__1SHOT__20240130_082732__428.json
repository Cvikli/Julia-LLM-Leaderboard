The `|>` operator is used to pass the result of one operation as the argument of another operation. In this case, the first operation (`groupby(df, :model)`) groups our data by `model`, and the second operation (`group_size`) calculates the number of rows in each group. \n\nFinally, we rename the column from `:value` to `:n_rows` (which is the more common way to name this type of column), and convert the result into a DataFrame.\n\nYou can use it like:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(model=[1 2 2 3; 4 5 5 6], x=[10 20 30 40; 50 60 70 80])\nprintln(count_model_rows(df))\n```\nThis will give you a DataFrame with two columns: `model` and `n_rows`. The value in the `model` column is unique, and the corresponding value in the `n_rows` column indicates how many rows have this model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,356],"elapsed":2.766984386,"_type":"aimessage"}]
