Then it uses the built-in DataFrames.jl function `groupby` to perform the grouping operation, and returns the number of rows in each group using the `nrow` function. \n\nPlease make sure you have DataFrames.jl installed in your environment for this code to work. You can do this by adding `Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\")` at the beginning of your script if it's not already installed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,215],"elapsed":1.656908169,"_type":"aimessage"}]
