The function uses pandas's `groupby()` method to group by 'model'. Then it uses `size()` method on grouped data which returns count of each unique value. So when you pass your dataframe df_cars to this function, it will return a series where index are models and values are the count of rows for that model.\n\nYou can use the above function like this:\n\n```python\nprint(count_model_rows(df_cars))\n```\n\nThis should output something like:\n\n```\nBMW      2\nAudi    1\nFiat    1\nMercedes 1\nFord    1\nName: model, dtype: int64\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,297],"elapsed":2.333927303,"_type":"aimessage"}]
