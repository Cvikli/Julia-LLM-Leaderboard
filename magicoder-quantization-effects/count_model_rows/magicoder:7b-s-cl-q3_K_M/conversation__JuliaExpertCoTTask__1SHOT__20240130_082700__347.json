Here is how you could do it:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = nrow.(grouped)\nend\n\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\nprintln(count_model_rows(df_cars))\n```\n\nThis function will return a Vector of integers where the `i`-th element is the number of rows for the `i`-th group in `grouped`.\n\nFor example, if you call `count_model_rows(df_cars)`, it will print `[2, 1, 3]`, since there are 2 rows with model \"a4\", one row with model \"a6\", and 3 rows with model \"q7\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,235],"elapsed":1.823390054,"_type":"aimessage"}]
