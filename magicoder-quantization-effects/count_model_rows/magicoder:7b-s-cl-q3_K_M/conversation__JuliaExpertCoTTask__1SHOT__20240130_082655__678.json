The function uses the DataFrames.jl package's `groupby` function to perform the grouping operation, then applies the `nrow` function to each group to get the count of rows.\n\nWhen you run this code with your sample data, it prints `[1, 2, 1, 1]`, which are the counts for \"a4\", \"a6\", \"q7\", and \"a4\" respectively.","status":200,"tokens":[0,277],"elapsed":2.145204018,"_type":"aimessage"}]
