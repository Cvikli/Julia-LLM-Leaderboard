Here's an example of such function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, CategoricalArrays\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = nrow.(grouped)\n    return counts\nend\n```\n\nHere is how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\n# Suppose df_cars is your DataFrame and it has columns 'model' and other data. \ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nfor (model, count) in pairs(counts)\n    println(\"$model: $count\")\nend\n```\n\nThis will print out the name of each model from `df_cars` DataFrame and how many rows there are for that model.\n\nRemember to replace `:model` with your actual column's label if it is different.","status":200,"tokens":[0,219],"elapsed":1.701181642,"_type":"aimessage"}]
