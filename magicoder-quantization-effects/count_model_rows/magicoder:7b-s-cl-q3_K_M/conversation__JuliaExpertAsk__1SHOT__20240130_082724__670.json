Here is an example:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n# Assuming df_cars is your DataFrame. \ndef count_model_rows(df):\n    return dict(Counter(df['model']))\n\n# Example usage\ndf_cars = pd.DataFrame({'model': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']}) # Sample data\nprint(count_model_rows(df_cars))  # Output: {'A': 1, 'B': 1, 'C': 1, 'D': 1, 'E': 1}\n```\nIn the code above we create a function `count_model_rows` that takes a DataFrame as input. Inside the function we use Counter from collections to count how many times each value in the 'model' column appears and return it as a dictionary. We assume here that all unique models are string values, if they can be any type you would need to convert them first.\n\nThen we create a sample DataFrame df_cars with some data in the 'model' column and print out the result of calling `count_model_rows(df_cars)`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,280],"elapsed":2.155999492,"_type":"aimessage"}]
