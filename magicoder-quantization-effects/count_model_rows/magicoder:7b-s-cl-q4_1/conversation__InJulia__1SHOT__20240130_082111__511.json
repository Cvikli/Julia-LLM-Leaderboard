Then, we use the `map` function to apply the anonymous function (denoted as `group -> nrow(group)`) to each group in the grouped data. The result of this operation is a Vector where each element corresponds to the number of rows in its respective model group.\n\nPlease note that you will need to add \"using DataFrames\" at the top of your script if it's not already there, and have imported DataFrames.jl into your environment before using these functions.","status":200,"tokens":[0,221],"elapsed":1.759624904,"_type":"aimessage"}]
