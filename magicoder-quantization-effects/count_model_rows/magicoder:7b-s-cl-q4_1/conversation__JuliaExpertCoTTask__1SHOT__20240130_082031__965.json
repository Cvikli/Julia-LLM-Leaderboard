Below is how you can define a function to count the rows per model:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    counts = groupby(df, :model) |> counts  # counts number of rows for each model\n    return counts\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `groupby` function to group the DataFrame by the \"model\" column. The `|>` is an operator that passes the result of the left hand side to the right hand side, allowing us to pipe the output of `groupby` directly into the `counts` function. \n\nYou can then call this function with your DataFrame as follows:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\ndisplay(result)  # displays the result of the function call\n```\n\nThis code should print:\n\n```julia\n1×2 DataFrame\n│ Row │ model     │ count   │\n│     │ String    │ Int64   │\n├─────┼───────────┼─────────┤\n│ 1   │ a4        │ 3       │\n│ 2   │ a6        │ 1       │\n│ 3   │ q7        │ 1       │\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,340],"elapsed":2.768685378,"_type":"aimessage"}]
