Then we iterate over each group of data with the same model and get their sizes to get the count of rows for each model. We store these counts in a Dict where keys are the models and values are the row counts.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes your DataFrame has a column named \"model\". If it's different, replace `:model` with the actual column name. Also, this code assumes that your data is sorted by `model`. If not, you may need to sort it first or handle it in another way depending on what you actually want to do.","status":200,"tokens":[0,274],"elapsed":2.19233698,"_type":"aimessage"}]
