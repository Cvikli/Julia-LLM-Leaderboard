Here's an example:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, DataFramesMeta\n\n# Suppose df_cars is a DataFrame and it has a column 'model'.\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"BMW\", \"Mercedes\", \"Ford\", \"BMW\", \"Mercedes\"])\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    return nrow.(grouped)\nend\n\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nIn this example, `groupby` will partition the DataFrame into groups based on the unique values in the 'model' column. The function `nrow` is used to count the number of rows for each group. The result is a vector where the i-th element is the number of rows in the i-th group.","status":200,"tokens":[0,219],"elapsed":1.743039887,"_type":"aimessage"}]
