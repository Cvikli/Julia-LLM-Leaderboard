The result is an array where index i corresponds to the number of rows in the ith group. \n\nNote that this solution assumes that you're running a fairly recent version of DataFrames.jl, where `groupby` is included as a built-in function and there are size methods available for grouped data frames. Older versions may require different solutions.","status":200,"tokens":[0,264],"elapsed":2.113938552,"_type":"aimessage"}]
