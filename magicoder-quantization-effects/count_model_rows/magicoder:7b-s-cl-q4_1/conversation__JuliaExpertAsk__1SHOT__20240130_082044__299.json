Then it uses the `nrow` function from DataFrames.jl package to count the number of rows for each group/model. It returns a Vector of integers, where each integer is the number of rows in one group.\n\nYou can call this function with an instance of your DataFrame like so:\n```julia\nmodels_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will return `models_counts` as a Vector where each element is the number of rows for each model in `df_cars`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,198],"elapsed":1.579517175,"_type":"aimessage"}]
