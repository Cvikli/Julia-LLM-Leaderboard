This code uses the DataFrames package for data manipulation. \n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return nrow.(groupby(df, :model)) |> vec\nend\n```\nIn this function, we use the groupby() function to group the rows of our data by `model` and then we use nrow() to count how many rows are in each group. The result is a Vector of integers where the i-th element is the number of rows for the i-th model in df_cars.\n\nYou can call this function with your DataFrame like: \n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\nprintln.(count_model_rows(df))\n```\nThis will return a Vector of Integers where each element corresponds to the number of rows for each unique model in your dataframe.","status":200,"tokens":[0,229],"elapsed":1.845079069,"_type":"aimessage"}]
