Here's an example of how you could do it:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Pandas\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = nrow.(grouped)\n    return counts\nend\n```\nThis function first groups the data frame by model using `groupby` method. Then, it calculates the number of rows in each group (i.e., for each unique value of 'model') using the `nrow` function.\n\nPlease note that you have to install Pandas.jl with `Pkg.add(\"Pandas\")` if not already done.\n\nThis function can be used like this:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"A\", \"B\"], column2=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\ncounts = count_model_rows(df)\nprint(counts)\n```\nThis will output: `[2, 2]` which is the number of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,266],"elapsed":2.127585533,"_type":"aimessage"}]
