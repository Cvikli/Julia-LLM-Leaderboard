It uses the `Dicts.jl` package to handle this easily. \n\nRunning this code would output something like: Dict(\"A\"=>1, \"B\"=>2, \"C\"=>2). This means that there is one row with model \"A\", two rows with model \"B\", and two rows with model \"C\".","status":200,"tokens":[59,331],"elapsed":3.022439378,"_type":"aimessage"}]
