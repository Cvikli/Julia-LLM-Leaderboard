The `nrow` function is then used on each group to count how many rows are in that group. \n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"A\", \"B\", \"C\"], other_column=[1,2,3,4,5])\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln.(counts) # prints: [2, 2, 1]\n```\nThis indicates that there are 2 rows for model \"A\", 2 rows for model \"B\", and 1 row for model \"C\".","status":200,"tokens":[90,237],"elapsed":2.172033753,"_type":"aimessage"}]
