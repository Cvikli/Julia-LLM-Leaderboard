Then, the `combine` function is used with a lambda function to compute the length of each group (which gives us the count of rows for each model). The result is returned as a new DataFrame.\n\nPlease make sure that you've installed and loaded necessary packages like \"DataFrames\" before running this code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,224],"elapsed":2.037436843,"_type":"aimessage"}]
