Here is a possible implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, DataFramesMeta\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    result = @groupby df [:model] begin \n        rowcount = size(_.unique(eachcol(select(_, Not(:model)))))[1]\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\nThis function should be called as follows: `count_model_rows(df_cars)` and it will return a grouped DataFrame where the groups are by 'model' and each group contains a single row with a column 'rowcount' that contains the count of rows in the original dataframe for that model.\n\nRemember to add `using DataFrames, DataFramesMeta` at the top of your script before running this function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,212],"elapsed":1.861009318,"_type":"aimessage"}]
