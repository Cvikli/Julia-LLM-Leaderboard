Here is a solution:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return combine(groupby(df, :model), length => identity)\nend\n\n# Usage example:\ndf = DataFrame(model=[randstring(3) for _ in 1:20], color=[\"red\", \"blue\"], price=[rand(100:500) for _ in 1:20])\n\ncount_model_rows(df)\n```\nThis function `combine` will return a new DataFrame where each row corresponds to a unique value of the `:model` column and its count. The `length => identity` part is telling it to calculate the length of each group (the number of rows), and then just take those counts as they are without changing them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,231],"elapsed":2.044436094,"_type":"aimessage"}]
