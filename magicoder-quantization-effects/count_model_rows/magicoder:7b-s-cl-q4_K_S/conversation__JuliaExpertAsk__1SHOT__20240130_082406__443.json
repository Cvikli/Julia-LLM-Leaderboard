Then, it uses the `nrow` function to count the number of rows for each group, which is essentially counting the instances of a particular model. The result is a DataFrame where each row corresponds to one unique value in the `:model` column and has a single column with the corresponding count.\n\nIf you need to get the counts as a dictionary (i.e., a map from models to their respective counts), you can use:\n\n```julia\nusing DictArrays\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return groupby(df, :model) |> DataFrame |> rowdicts |> collect\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[90,265],"elapsed":2.066997946,"_type":"aimessage"}]
