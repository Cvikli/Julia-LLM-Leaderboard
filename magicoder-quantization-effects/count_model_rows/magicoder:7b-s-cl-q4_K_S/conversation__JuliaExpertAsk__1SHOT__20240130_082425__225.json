Here is an example of what your code might look like:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef count_model_rows(df):\n    return df.groupby('model').size().reset_index()\n\n# Assuming that df_cars is a DataFrame with 'model' column\ndf_result = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprint(df_result)\n```\nThis code defines a function `count_model_rows` which takes a DataFrame as input and returns another DataFrame. Inside the function, it uses groupby() to create groups of data based on the 'model' column in your DataFrame. The size() method counts the number of rows in each group and reset_index() is used to convert the result from an index back into a column. \n\nThe output will be a new DataFrame with two columns: 'model' (which contains the unique model names) and 0 (which contains the count of cars for each model).","status":200,"tokens":[0,228],"elapsed":1.757603643,"_type":"aimessage"}]
