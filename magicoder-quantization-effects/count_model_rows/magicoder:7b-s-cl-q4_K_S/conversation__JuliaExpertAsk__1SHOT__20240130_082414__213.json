If you want the column name as `count` instead of `0`, you can just rename it afterward like this:\n\n```python\nresult.columns = ['model', 'count']\n```\n\nHowever, please note that the specific implementation might be different depending on the language and libraries (such as Julia, R) that you use as DataFrame handling in these languages may not exactly match with pandas of Python. The code above is written for a Python environment where `pandas` library is used.","status":200,"tokens":[0,325],"elapsed":2.512992455,"_type":"aimessage"}]
