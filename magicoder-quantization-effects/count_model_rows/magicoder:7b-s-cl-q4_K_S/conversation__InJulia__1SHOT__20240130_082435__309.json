Here is an example:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model) # Group data by model column\n    \n    result = DataFrame() # Create a new empty dataframe\n    for group in grouped \n        row = [group[1], length(group)] # Create a new row with the model name and number of rows in that group\n        push!(result, row) # Add this new row to the result dataframe\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\nThis function first groups the data by the `model` column using the `groupby` function. It then iterates over each group (which corresponds to a unique model), counts the number of rows in that group, and adds a new row to the resulting dataframe with this information. \n\nYou can use it like this:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"A\", \"B\", \"C\"]) # Sample data for demonstration\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will print a dataframe with the models as the first column and their respective row counts as the second.","status":200,"tokens":[0,298],"elapsed":2.293440565,"_type":"aimessage"}]
