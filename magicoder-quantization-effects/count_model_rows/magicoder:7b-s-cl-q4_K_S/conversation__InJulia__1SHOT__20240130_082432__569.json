Then we define a function `count_model_rows`, which takes a DataFrame and groups it by the 'model' column. For each unique 'model', the function counts how many rows there are in that group (i.e., for each unique model, it calculates the length of the corresponding vector of grouped data). The results are returned as a new DataFrame.\n\nThe final part applies this function to our `df_cars` DataFrame and stores the result in `result`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,300],"elapsed":2.313792191,"_type":"aimessage"}]
