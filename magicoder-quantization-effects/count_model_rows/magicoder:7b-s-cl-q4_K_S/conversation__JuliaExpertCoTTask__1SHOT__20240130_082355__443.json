Here is how you might write that function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return nrow.(groupby(df, :model))\nend\n\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n\nfor (k, v) in zip(df_cars.model, counts)\n    @info \"$(k): $(v)\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses `groupby` to create subsets of the data grouped by model and then calculates the number of rows in each subset using `nrow`. The result is a vector where the index corresponds to the model name and the value at that index corresponds to the count of rows for that model. You can iterate over this result to print out counts for all models if you want.\n\nThe resulting output will be:\n```julia\nInfo: \"a4\": 3\nInfo: \"a6\": 1\nInfo: \"q7\": 1\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,298],"elapsed":2.324153233,"_type":"aimessage"}]
