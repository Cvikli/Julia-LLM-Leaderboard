Then, for each group, `size` function is called which returns a tuple with the number of rows in that group and columns in that group (in our case there are only rows so we take the first element from the tuple). Finally, `map` applies this operation to every group and returns a vector with counts.","status":200,"tokens":[0,211],"elapsed":1.640994628,"_type":"aimessage"}]
