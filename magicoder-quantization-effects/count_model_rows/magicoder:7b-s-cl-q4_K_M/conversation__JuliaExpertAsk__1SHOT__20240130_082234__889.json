Here is a simple function to accomplish your task:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    return nrow.(groupby(df_cars, :model))\nend\n```\nThis function uses the groupby function from DataFrames.jl to group rows by the 'model' column and then counts the number of rows in each group using the nrow function which gives the number of rows in a grouped dataframe.\n\nThe result would be an array where each element is the number of rows for corresponding model.\n\nPlease note, you need to add the DataFrames package by doing `using DataFrames` before running this code. If it is not installed yet, do so using Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\").","status":200,"tokens":[0,207],"elapsed":1.660919236,"_type":"aimessage"}]
