Here is an example of how you might implement this:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    return combine(grouped, length => :count)\nend\n```\nThis function first groups the `DataFrame` by column \"model\". The `groupby` method returns a GroupedDataFrame which is an iterator that yields rows of the original DataFrame for each unique value in the grouping variable. \n\nThen, it uses the `combine` function to apply a function to all rows within each group and return the result as a new DataFrame. The function here is length => :count, which returns the count of elements in each group (i.e., number of rows for each model).\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"Tesla\", \"BMW\", \"Audi\", \"Tesla\", \"BMW\"])\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\ndisplay(result)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,259],"elapsed":1.991188568,"_type":"aimessage"}]
