Here's an example:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames # Ensure you have this package installed in your Julia environment\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model) # Group dataframe by model column\n    return nrow.(grouped) .- 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude the grouping column from count\nend\n```\n\nYou can then use this function on your `df_cars` DataFrame:\n\n```julia\nmodel_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThis will give you an array of counts for each unique model in the dataframe. The index of this array corresponds to the order of the models in `df_cars.model`.","status":200,"tokens":[59,223],"elapsed":1.806484647,"_type":"aimessage"}]
