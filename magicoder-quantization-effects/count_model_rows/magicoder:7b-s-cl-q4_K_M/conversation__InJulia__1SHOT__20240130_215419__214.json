The results are stored in a vector, which is returned by the function.\n\nThe example usage shows how to use this function on a DataFrame with some sample data. It prints out the count of rows for each unique model in the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,276],"elapsed":2.15380568,"_type":"aimessage"}]
