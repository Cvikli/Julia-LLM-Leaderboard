Then, for each group of rows, you can get a count of rows using `nrow`. Here is an example code:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFramesMeta\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return df |> @groupby(:model) |> @transform(_.nrow .- 1)\nend\n```\n\nThis function will return a new DataFrame with columns 'model' and the number of rows for each model. Note that `nrow` returns the total number of rows in the group, which includes the first row (which is usually used as metadata), we subtract 1 to get the actual count of rows.","status":200,"tokens":[0,173],"elapsed":1.381382574,"_type":"aimessage"}]
