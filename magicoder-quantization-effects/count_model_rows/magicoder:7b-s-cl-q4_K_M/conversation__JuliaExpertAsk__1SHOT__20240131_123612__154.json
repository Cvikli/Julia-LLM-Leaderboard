The result is a new DataFrame where each row represents a unique model in the original DataFrame, and the second column contains the count of rows for that model.\n\nTo use this function with your `df_cars` DataFrame:\n```julia\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,188],"elapsed":1.487527256,"_type":"aimessage"}]
