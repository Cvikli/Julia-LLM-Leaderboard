Here is an example of how that could be done:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    gdf = groupby(df, :model)\n    return nrow.(gdf)\nend\n\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\nprintln.(count_model_rows(df_cars))\n```\n\nThis script first groups the data by the 'model' column, and then calculates the number of rows for each group. The result is a vector with the count of rows in each group. \n\nPlease note that you would need to have `DataFrames` package installed. You can add it using Julia's package manager (Pkg) by running the following command:\n```julia\nusing Pkg; Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,237],"elapsed":1.91033923,"_type":"aimessage"}]
