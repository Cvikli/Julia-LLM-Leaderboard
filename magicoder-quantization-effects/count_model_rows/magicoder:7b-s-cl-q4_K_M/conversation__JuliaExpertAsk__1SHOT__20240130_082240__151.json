Then, we define our function `count_model_rows` which uses the `value_counts()` method to count the number of rows for each unique value in the 'model' column. Finally, we call this function with our DataFrame as an argument and print the result.\n\nNote that the sample data here only has three models: BMW, Audi, and Mercedes, but you can replace it with your own data.\n  \nAlso note that if you want to use Julia for this task, then the task can be solved using the DataFrames package in Julia, which is similar to Pandas in Python. Here's how:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, CategoricalArrays\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"BMW\", \"Audi\", \"BMW\", \"Audi\", \"Mercedes\"])\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df)\n    return counts(df.model)\nend\n\nprintln(count_model_rows(df_cars))\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,362],"elapsed":2.918162089,"_type":"aimessage"}]
