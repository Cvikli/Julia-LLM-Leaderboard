It then uses the `map` function to count the number of rows in each group (which is equivalent to counting the number of elements in each group). The result is a new DataFrame where each row corresponds to a unique model, and the value in that row is the count of how many times that model appears in the original DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,168],"elapsed":1.308399628,"_type":"aimessage"}]
