It then calculates the number of rows for each group using the `nrow` function, which returns the size of an AbstractDataFrame (or grouped object) along a certain dimension. The results are returned as a vector of counts.\n\nThe code then tests this function with a provided DataFrame and prints out the count for each model in the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,287],"elapsed":2.296637547,"_type":"aimessage"}]
