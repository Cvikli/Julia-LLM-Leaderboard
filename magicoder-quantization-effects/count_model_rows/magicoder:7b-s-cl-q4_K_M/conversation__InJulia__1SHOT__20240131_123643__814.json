Then, for each group of rows with the same model, `nrow` is called to count how many there are. The results are returned as an array of counts. Finally, we print out a message for each unique model in the DataFrame, along with its corresponding row count.","status":200,"tokens":[0,238],"elapsed":1.877054541,"_type":"aimessage"}]
