Then it calculates the number of rows in each group (i.e., for each unique model). The result is a vector of integers, where the i-th integer corresponds to the number of rows in the i-th group.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"B\", \"A\"])  # example data frame\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln.(counts)\n```\nThis will print the number of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,226],"elapsed":1.766453547,"_type":"aimessage"}]
