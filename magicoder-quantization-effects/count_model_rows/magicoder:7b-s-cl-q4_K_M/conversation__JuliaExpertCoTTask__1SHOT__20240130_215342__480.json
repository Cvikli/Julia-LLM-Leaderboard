Here is how you could implement this:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, CategoricalArrays\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = map(x -> length(x), grouped)\n    return counts\nend\n\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nIn this code, `groupby` groups the rows in `df_cars` by the `:model` column. Then `map` applies a function to each group and returns an array of counts for each group. Here, the function is `length`, which returns the number of elements in its argument. The result is a vector of counts for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,222],"elapsed":1.750382241,"_type":"aimessage"}]
