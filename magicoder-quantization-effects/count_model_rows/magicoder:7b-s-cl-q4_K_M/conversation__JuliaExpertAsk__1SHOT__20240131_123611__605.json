Then `combine` function is used to calculate how many rows there are for each group. The result is a new DataFrame where each row represents one unique model and its count of rows in the original DataFrame.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that your data frame has a \"model\" column, and it's not empty or contains missing values. If you have other requirements, feel free to modify this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,199],"elapsed":1.574614832,"_type":"aimessage"}]
