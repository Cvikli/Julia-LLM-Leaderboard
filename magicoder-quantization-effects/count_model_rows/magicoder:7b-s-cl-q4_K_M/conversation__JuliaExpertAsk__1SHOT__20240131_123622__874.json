The result is returned as an array of integers. \n\nThe `groupby` function from DataFrames package groups the data frame based on unique values of a column, here it is \"model\". Then we calculate the number of rows (using `nrow`) for each group and store them into an array.\n\nPlease replace the example DataFrame with your actual DataFrame to use this function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,267],"elapsed":2.127356765,"_type":"aimessage"}]
