The function will return a new DataFrame with grouped data. Here's an example of how you might implement it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef count_model_rows(df):\n    return df.groupby('model').size().reset_index()\n\n# use the function\ndf_cars = pd.DataFrame({\n  'model': ['BMW', 'Mercedes', 'Audi', 'BMW', 'Mercedes', 'Audi'],\n  'other_column': [1,2,3,4,5,6]\n})\n\nprint(count_model_rows(df_cars))\n```\nIn this example, we're creating a sample DataFrame with two columns: `model` and `other_column`. We then use the function to group the data by 'model' and calculate how many rows there are for each.\n\nThe output of this script would be:\n```python\n  model  size\n0  Audi     3\n1 BMW      2\n2 Mercedes  2\n```\nThis shows that there are 3 rows in the DataFrame with `model` \"Audi\", and 2 rows each for \"BMW\" and \"Mercedes\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,300],"elapsed":2.41586545,"_type":"aimessage"}]
