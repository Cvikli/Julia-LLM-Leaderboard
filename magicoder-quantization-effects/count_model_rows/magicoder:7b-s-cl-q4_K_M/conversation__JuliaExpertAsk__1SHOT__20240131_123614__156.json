Here's an example of how you could define your function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, CategoricalArrays\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = nrow.(grouped)\n    return counts\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, `groupby` groups the dataframe by the column \"model\". Then, for each group (i.e., for each unique model), it calculates the number of rows using `nrow`. The result is a vector with the count of rows for each group. \n\nYou can use your DataFrame like this:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"B\", \"A\"])\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will return a vector of counts for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,220],"elapsed":1.742356914,"_type":"aimessage"}]
