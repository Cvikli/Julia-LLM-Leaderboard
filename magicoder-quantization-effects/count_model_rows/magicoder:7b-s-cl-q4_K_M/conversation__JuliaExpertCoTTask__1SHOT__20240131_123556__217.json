Then it calculates the number of rows in each group using `nrow`. The result is returned as an array of integers, where each integer represents the number of rows in one model's group.\n\nLet's test this function with your data:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will return `[3, 1, 2]` as there are 3 rows for 'a4', 1 row for 'a6' and 2 rows for 'q7'.","status":200,"tokens":[0,240],"elapsed":1.916855652,"_type":"aimessage"}]
