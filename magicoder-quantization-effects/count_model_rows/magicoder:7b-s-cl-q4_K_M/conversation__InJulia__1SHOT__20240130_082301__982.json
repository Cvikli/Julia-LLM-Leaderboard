Here is an example of how you might accomplish this task using the groupby function in DataFrames.jl:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df_cars, :model) # Group data by model column\n    \n    # Use the count() function to get counts of each group (i.e., number of rows for each model)\n    grouped_counts = combine(grouped, nrow) \n    \n    return grouped_counts\nend\n```\nIn this code snippet, we use `groupby` function from DataFrames.jl to split the data frame into groups based on the unique values in the `:model` column. Then, we use `combine` function to apply a function (in this case, count of rows `nrow`) to each group and return as a new data frame.\n\nPlease note that you should have DataFrames.jl installed in your Julia environment for this code snippet to work. You can add it using Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\") if it's not already available.","status":200,"tokens":[0,279],"elapsed":2.237054292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
