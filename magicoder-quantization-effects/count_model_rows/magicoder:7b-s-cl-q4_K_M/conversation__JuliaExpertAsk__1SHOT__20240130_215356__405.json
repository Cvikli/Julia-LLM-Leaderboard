The result is a new DataFrame where each row represents a unique model and its corresponding count of rows.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"A\", \"B\"])\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(counts)\n```\nThis will output a new DataFrame with two columns: `model` and `counts`, where the counts represent the number of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,254],"elapsed":1.990712205,"_type":"aimessage"}]
