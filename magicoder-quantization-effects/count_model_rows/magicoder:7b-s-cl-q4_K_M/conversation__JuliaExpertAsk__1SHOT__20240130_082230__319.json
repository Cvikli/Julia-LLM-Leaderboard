The result is a collection of integers representing the number of rows in each group.\n\nLet's test this function with an example:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"A\", \"C\"])\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprint.(result)\n```\nThis will print `[2, 1, 1]`, which indicates that there are 2 rows for model A, 1 row for model B and 1 row for model C.","status":200,"tokens":[0,217],"elapsed":1.734083981,"_type":"aimessage"}]
