Then we use the `nrow` function to get the number of rows for each group (i.e., model). The result is a Vector of counts where the index corresponds to the original order of models in the DataFrame.\n\nYou can print out the counts like this:\n```julia\nfor i in 1:length(counts)\n    println(\"Model $(df_cars[i, :model]) has $(counts[i]) rows.\")\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,238],"elapsed":2.021901966,"_type":"aimessage"}]
