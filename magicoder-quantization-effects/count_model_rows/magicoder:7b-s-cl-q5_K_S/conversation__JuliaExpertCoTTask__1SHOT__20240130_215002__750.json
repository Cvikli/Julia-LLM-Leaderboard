It then uses the `combine` function to calculate the number of rows for each group, which is equivalent to counting the occurrences of each model in the DataFrame. The result is a new DataFrame where each row represents a unique model and its count.","status":200,"tokens":[0,206],"elapsed":1.72775752,"_type":"aimessage"}]
