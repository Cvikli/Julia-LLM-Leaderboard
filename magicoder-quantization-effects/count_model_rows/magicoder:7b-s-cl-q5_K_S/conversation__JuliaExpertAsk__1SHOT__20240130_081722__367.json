Here we are using Pandas which is one of the most popular data manipulation library in Python:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n```\nThe function `count_model_rows` will take a DataFrame df_cars and return another DataFrame with grouped model names and their corresponding counts. \n\n```python\ndef count_model_rows(df):\n    # Use groupby to group the data by 'model'\n    grouped = df.groupby('model')\n    \n    # For each group, get the size which is equivalent to number of rows\n    result = grouped.size().reset_index()\n    \n    # The resulting DataFrame has two columns: 'model' and 0 with the count of rows for each model\n    return result\n```\n\nYou can use this function on your DataFrame df_cars like this:\n\n```python\ndf_count = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprint(df_count)\n```\nThis will print a new DataFrame with the counts of each model in `df_cars`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,246],"elapsed":2.102734899,"_type":"aimessage"}]
