Then, you can count the number of rows in each group using the `nrow` function. Here is an example:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, DataFramesMeta\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = @groupby df :model\n    counts = map(grouped) do group\n        (model = first(group[!, :model]), nrows = length(group))\n    end\n    return counts\nend\n```\nIn this function, the `@groupby` macro groups your data by column `model`. The `map` function applies a function to each group, in this case, calculating the number of rows. The result is a DataFrame with two columns: `model` and `nrows`, where `nrows` represents the number of rows for each model.\n\nYou can use it like this:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"A\", \"B\"])\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will give you a DataFrame with two rows for each model, showing the number of times each model appears in your dataframe.","status":200,"tokens":[0,290],"elapsed":2.442609096,"_type":"aimessage"}]
