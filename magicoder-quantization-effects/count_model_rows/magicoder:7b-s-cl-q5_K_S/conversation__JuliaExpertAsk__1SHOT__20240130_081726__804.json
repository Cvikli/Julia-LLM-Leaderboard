It then uses the `combine` method to calculate the count of rows (`nrow`) for each group which is equivalent to counting the number of rows in each group. The result is returned as a new DataFrame where columns are the unique values found in the `model` column and rows represent counts of their respective groups.","status":200,"tokens":[0,159],"elapsed":1.357904946,"_type":"aimessage"}]
