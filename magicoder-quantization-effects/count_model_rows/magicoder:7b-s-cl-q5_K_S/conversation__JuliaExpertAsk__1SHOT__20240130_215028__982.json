The `combine` function then calculates the number of rows in each group and returns a new DataFrame with these counts. \n\nPlease note that you need to have the DataFrames package installed in your Julia environment to use this function. If it's not installed, you can add it using the following command: `Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\")`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,180],"elapsed":1.50262843,"_type":"aimessage"}]
