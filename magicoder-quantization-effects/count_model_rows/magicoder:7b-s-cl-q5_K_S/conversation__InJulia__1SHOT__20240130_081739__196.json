Note that you must have DataFrames installed in your environment to run this code:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = combine(grouped, nrow => sum)\n    return counts\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a DataFrame as an argument and returns another DataFrame where each row represents the count of rows for a single model. The `groupby` function groups the data by 'model', the `combine` function then applies a function (in this case, counting number of rows with `nrow => sum`) to each group. \n\nHere is how you can use it:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"BMW\", \"Toyota\", \"BMW\", \"Audi\", \"BMW\", \"Toyota\"], year=[2015, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2016, 2017])\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis would return a DataFrame with two columns: `model` and `:n`. The column 'n' represents the count of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,316],"elapsed":2.628968586,"_type":"aimessage"}]
