The result is a new DataFrame with two columns: 'model' (the name of each model) and 'nrow' (the number of rows for that model).\n\nHere is how you can use this function on your data:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThis will return a new DataFrame with one row for each unique model in the original DataFrame, and two columns: 'model' (with the name of the model) and 'nrow' (with the number of rows for that model). For example, if you run this on your provided data, it would return:\n\n|    | model | nrow |\n|----|-------|------|\n| 1  | a4    | 3    |\n| 2  | a6    | 1    |\n| 3  | q7    | 1    |\n\nThis means there are 3 rows for the model 'a4', one row for the model 'a6', and one row for the model 'q7'.","status":200,"tokens":[0,372],"elapsed":3.147978302,"_type":"aimessage"}]
