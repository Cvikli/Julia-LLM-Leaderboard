Here is an example of how to implement this:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model) # group by 'model' column\n    return nrow.(grouped)  # calculate number of rows for each 'model'\nend\n```\n\nYou can call this function with your DataFrame as the argument to get a vector of counts for each unique model in the DataFrame.\n\nHere is an example usage:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"A\", \"B\", \"C\"]) # Example data frame\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprint(counts)\n```\n\nThis will print: `[2, 2, 1]` which represents the number of rows for each unique model in the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,228],"elapsed":1.940315451,"_type":"aimessage"}]
