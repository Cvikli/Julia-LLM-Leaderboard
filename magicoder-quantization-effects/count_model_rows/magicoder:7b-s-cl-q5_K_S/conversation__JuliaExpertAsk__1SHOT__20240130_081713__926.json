Here is an example of how you can achieve it:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, CategoricalArrays  # assuming you have used 'CategoricalArrays' for categorical variable\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)   # create a grouped object by the column 'model'\n    counts = count.(grouped.index)  # use count function to get row count for each model\n    return counts\nend\n```\nThis function will return an array of tuples where each tuple contains the model name and the number of rows associated with that model in the DataFrame. Note that we're assuming that `model` column is of type `CategoricalArrays.CategoricalString`, if it's not, you may need to convert it first:\n```julia\ndf[:model] = CategoricalArray(df[:model])\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,225],"elapsed":1.916716644,"_type":"aimessage"}]
