Inside the function, we use the `@>`, or 'piped' operator to pass our DataFrame into a pipeline of operations. \n\nThe first operation is `groupby(:model)`, which groups the data by the 'model' column. The second operation is `summarise(n = :_)` which calculates a new column, 'n', for each group that counts how many rows are in that group.\n\nWhen you run this code with your example DataFrame df_cars, it will return: \n\n| model | n |\n|-------|---|\n| A     | 2 |\n| B     | 2 |\n| C     | 1 |","status":200,"tokens":[0,285],"elapsed":2.409125492,"_type":"aimessage"}]
