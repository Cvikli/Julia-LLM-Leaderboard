Here's how you might do it:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = nrow.(grouped)\n    \n    return Dict(zip(grouped.colindexes[1], counts))\nend\n```\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df` as input and returns a dictionary where the keys are the unique values in the 'model' column, and the values are the corresponding count of rows for each model. The `groupby` function groups the data by 'model', and the `nrow` function calculates the number of rows in each group. Finally, we use `zip` to combine the grouped models with their counts into a dictionary.\n\nYou can call this function like so:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"A\", \"B\"], year=[2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019])\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(counts)\n```\nThis will output:\n`Dict(\"A\"=>3,\"B\"=>2,\"C\"=>1)`","status":200,"tokens":[0,338],"elapsed":2.858099862,"_type":"aimessage"}]
