Then the `nrow` function is used to count the number of rows for each group. The result is a Vector of Int64 where every value represents the number of rows for each model. \n\nThis code assumes that you have imported all necessary packages and defined your DataFrame appropriately. Please make sure to replace `:model` with the correct column name in case it's different in your dataset.","status":200,"tokens":[0,193],"elapsed":1.628769923,"_type":"aimessage"}]
