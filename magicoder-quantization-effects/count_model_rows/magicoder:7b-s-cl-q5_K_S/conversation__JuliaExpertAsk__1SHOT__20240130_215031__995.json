It then uses the `combine` function to calculate the number of rows for each model and return it as a new DataFrame. \n\nPlease note that you need to install the necessary packages (like `CategoricalArrays`) before running this code. You can do so by adding them in your Julia environment with commands like `using Pkg; Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\"); Pkg.add(\"CategoricalArrays\")`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,211],"elapsed":1.763290254,"_type":"aimessage"}]
