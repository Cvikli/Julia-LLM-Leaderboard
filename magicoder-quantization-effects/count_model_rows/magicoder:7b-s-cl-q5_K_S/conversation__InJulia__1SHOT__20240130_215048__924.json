Here is an example:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, DataFramesMeta\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return nrow.(groupby(df, :model))\nend\n```\nThis function takes a DataFrame as input and returns a Vector of integers. Each integer in the vector represents the number of rows for each group in the DataFrame.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\n# Assuming df_cars is your DataFrame\nmodels = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nfor (model, count) in zip(unique(df_cars.model), models)\n    println(\"Model $(model) has $(count) rows.\")\nend\n```\nThis will print out the number of rows for each unique model in your DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,235],"elapsed":1.957769958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
