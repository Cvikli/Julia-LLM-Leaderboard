Then, you can use the `nrow` function to count the number of rows in each group. Here's how you could write such a function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n    counts = nrow.(grouped)\n    return counts\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a dataframe as input and returns an array of integers, where each integer is the number of rows in the corresponding group. The groups are determined by the 'model' column.","status":200,"tokens":[0,166],"elapsed":1.3978146,"_type":"aimessage"}]
