Then, for each group, we calculate the number of rows using the `size` function and store these counts in an array (`counts`). \n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"A\", \"B\", \"C\"])\nprintln.(count_model_rows(df_cars))\n```\nThis will output: `[2, 2, 1]` which corresponds to the number of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,227],"elapsed":1.912498112,"_type":"aimessage"}]
