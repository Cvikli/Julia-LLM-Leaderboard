Here is an example of how you could do it:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, CategoricalArrays\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    \n    for grp in grouped\n        model_name = first(grp)[1] # get the name of the group\n        row_count = size(grp)[1]  # count how many rows there are in this group\n        \n        println(\"Number of rows for model $(model_name): $row_count\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\nYou can call this function with a DataFrame like so:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(model=[\"Mazda\", \"Ford\", \"Toyota\", \"Mazda\", \"Toyota\"]) # example data\ncount_model_rows(df)\n``` \n\nThis will output how many rows there are for each model in the given dataframe. In this case, it would print:\n\n```\nNumber of rows for model Mazda: 2\nNumber of rows for model Ford: 1\nNumber of rows for model Toyota: 2\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,283],"elapsed":2.415274157,"_type":"aimessage"}]
