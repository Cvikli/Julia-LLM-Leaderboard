Then it uses the `combine` function to calculate the number of rows for each group (which corresponds to different model values in this case). The result is returned as a new DataFrame where the index is the unique models and the column contains their corresponding counts.","status":200,"tokens":[0,158],"elapsed":1.328678301,"_type":"aimessage"}]
