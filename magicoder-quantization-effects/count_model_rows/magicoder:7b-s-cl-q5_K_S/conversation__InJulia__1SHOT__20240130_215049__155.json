Then, we use the `combine` function to calculate the number of rows for each model and store it in a new DataFrame named 'counts'. The operation `nrow => \"count\"` is used to rename the column that contains the row counts to 'count'.\n\nYou can call this function with your DataFrame as follows:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"A\", \"B\"])  # example dataframe\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,223],"elapsed":1.854603155,"_type":"aimessage"}]
