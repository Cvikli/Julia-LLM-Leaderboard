The result is a new DataFrame `countrow` with columns `:model` (the model name) and `:nrows` (number of rows).\n\nNote: To use this function, make sure you have imported the DataFrames package and your dataframe df_cars has been created or loaded before calling `count_model_rows(df_cars)`. \n\nFor example:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"BMW\", \"Audi\", \"BMW\", \"Audi\"])\nprint(count_model_rows(df_cars))\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,271],"elapsed":2.311314948,"_type":"aimessage"}]
