The result is a new DataFrame where each row represents a unique model and its count. \n\nPlease note that you need to install the DataFrames package if it's not already installed by running `Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\")` in your Julia console before using this function.","status":200,"tokens":[59,189],"elapsed":1.594370737,"_type":"aimessage"}]
