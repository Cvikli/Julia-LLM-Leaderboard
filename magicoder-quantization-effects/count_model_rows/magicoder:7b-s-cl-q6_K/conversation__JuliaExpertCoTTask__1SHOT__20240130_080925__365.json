This function takes a DataFrame as input and uses the groupby and size functions from pandas to group rows by 'model' and calculate the number of rows for each model.\n\nFinally, we create our test DataFrame and call our function with it. The resulting Series will have an index of unique 'model' values and corresponding counts of how many rows have that value.","status":200,"tokens":[0,207],"elapsed":2.001096132,"_type":"aimessage"}]
