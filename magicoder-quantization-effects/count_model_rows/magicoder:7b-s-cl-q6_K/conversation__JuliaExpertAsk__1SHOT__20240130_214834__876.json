Then it calculates the number of rows (using `nrow`) for each group and returns these counts as a vector. \n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", \"A\", \"B\"]) # example dataframe\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nfor (model, count) in zip(unique(df_cars.model), counts)\n    println(\"Model: $model - Count: $count\")\nend\n```\nThis will print out the model and its corresponding row count for each unique model in your DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,269],"elapsed":2.541405037,"_type":"aimessage"}]
