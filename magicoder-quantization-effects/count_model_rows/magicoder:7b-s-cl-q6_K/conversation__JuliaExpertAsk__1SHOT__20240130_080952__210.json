Then it calculates the number of rows for each group (using `@groupby(_ -> length)`). Finally, it selects only the `model` column and its corresponding counts (`:count`) into a new DataFrame.\n\nTo use this function with your DataFrame df_cars, you would call something like:\n```julia\ndf_models = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will return a DataFrame `df_models` where each row represents a unique model in `df_cars`, and its `:count` column shows how many rows there are for that model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,241],"elapsed":2.321739543,"_type":"aimessage"}]
