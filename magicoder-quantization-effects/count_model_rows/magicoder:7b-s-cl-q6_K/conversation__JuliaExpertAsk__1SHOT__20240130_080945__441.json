The result is a Vector of integers, where the i-th integer corresponds to the count of rows for the i-th unique model. \n\nRemember that indexing in Julia starts from 1, so if you want to match Python's zero-based index then you can just add a `1` to your counts vector before returning it:\n```julia\nreturn counts .+ 1\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,228],"elapsed":2.19473613,"_type":"aimessage"}]
