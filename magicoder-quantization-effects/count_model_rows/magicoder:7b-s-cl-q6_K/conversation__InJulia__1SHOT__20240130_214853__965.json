The `combine` function then calculates the number of rows for each group (i.e., model). The result is a new DataFrame where each row represents a unique model and its corresponding count of rows in that model's group.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", \"G\", \"H\", \"I\", \"J\"], \n                   other_column=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]) # example DataFrame\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will return a new DataFrame where each row represents a unique model and its corresponding count of rows in that model's group.","status":200,"tokens":[0,281],"elapsed":2.660089392,"_type":"aimessage"}]
