Then, for each group (`grouped`), it calculates the number of rows using `nrow` function which returns an array with length equal to number of groups. Thus, we obtain a count for each unique value in `model` column.\n  \nLet's use this function on your provided DataFrame: \n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThe output is an array of counts for each unique `model` in the dataframe: `[2, 1, 2]` which means that there are 2 rows with model 'a4', 1 row with model 'a6' and 2 rows with model 'q7'.","status":200,"tokens":[0,264],"elapsed":2.561074344,"_type":"aimessage"}]
