Here's an example of how you might do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef count_model_rows(df_cars):\n    counts = defaultdict(int)\n    for model in df_cars['model']:\n        counts[model] += 1\n    return dict(counts)\n```\n\nThis function initializes a dictionary with zeros, then it goes through each row in the DataFrame and increments the count of that model. When all rows have been processed, it returns this dictionary.\n\nHowever, if you are looking for a more pythonic way to achieve this using pandas built-in functions, you can do:\n```python\ndef count_model_rows(df_cars):\n    return df_cars['model'].value_counts().to_dict()\n```\n\nThis function returns a dictionary where the keys are unique car models and the values are their corresponding counts.","status":200,"tokens":[0,227],"elapsed":2.184653173,"_type":"aimessage"}]
