Then, we use the `combine` function to calculate the number of rows for each group (i.e., model). The result is a new DataFrame where the first column is the model and the second column is the count of rows for that model.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, CategoricalArrays\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"A\", \"B\"])\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(counts)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```julia\n2×2 DataFrame\n│ Row │ model   │ x1     │\n│     │ String  │ Int64  │\n├─────┼─────────┼────────┤\n│ 1   │ A       │ 2      │\n│ 2   │ B       │ 2      │\n│ 3   │ C       │ 1      │\n```\n\nThis indicates that there are 2 rows for model \"A\", 2 rows for model \"B\", and 1 row for model \"C\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,359],"elapsed":3.405129197,"_type":"aimessage"}]
