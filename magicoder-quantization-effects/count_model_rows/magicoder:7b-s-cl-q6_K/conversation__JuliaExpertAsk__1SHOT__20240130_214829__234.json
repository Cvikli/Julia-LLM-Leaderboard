The result is a new DataFrame where each row represents a unique model and its corresponding count of rows.\n\nYou can use it like this:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", \"A\", \"B\", \"C\"], \n                   other_column=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) # replace with your actual data\n\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will return a new DataFrame where each row represents a unique model and the number of rows for that model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,258],"elapsed":2.438341426,"_type":"aimessage"}]
