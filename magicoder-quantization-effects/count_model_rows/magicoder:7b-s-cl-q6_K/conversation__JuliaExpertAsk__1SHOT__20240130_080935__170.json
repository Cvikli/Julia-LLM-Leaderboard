It first uses the groupby function to group the DataFrame by the 'model' column. Then, it uses the nrow function on the grouped data which gives the number of rows for each group. Finally, it returns the counts.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"BMW\", \"Audi\", \"BMW\", \"Audi\", \"Ford\"]) # example dataframe\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n\n# counts will contain an array with the number of rows for each model.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,237],"elapsed":2.276127872,"_type":"aimessage"}]
