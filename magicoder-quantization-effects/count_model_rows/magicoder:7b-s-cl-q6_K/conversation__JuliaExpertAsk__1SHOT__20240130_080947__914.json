The function below will count the number of rows per unique model in the DataFrame:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\n# Define a simple DataFrame with some car models\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"Toyota\", \"Honda\", \"Tesla\", \"Ford\", \"Toyota\"])\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    # Group the dataframe by 'model' column, and calculate counts\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = combine(grouped, nrow => \"count\")\n    \n    return counts\nend\n\n# Call function on DataFrame df_cars\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will output a new dataframe where each row is a unique model and the corresponding column 'count' is the number of rows for that model. For example, in this case, the output would be:\n\n| model | count |\n|-------|-------|\n| Ford  | 1     |\n| Honda | 1     |\n| Toyota | 2     |\n| Tesla | 1     |","status":200,"tokens":[0,272],"elapsed":2.619707396,"_type":"aimessage"}]
