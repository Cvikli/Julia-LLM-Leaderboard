It uses the groupby function from DataFrames to create a grouped collection of rows in the dataframe based on their model values. Then, it calculates the number of rows for each group using the nrow function and stores these counts in an array. \n\nFinally, the function iterates over the keys (unique models) and counts (number of rows for each model), printing out a formatted string for each one.","status":200,"tokens":[0,304],"elapsed":2.930261989,"_type":"aimessage"}]
