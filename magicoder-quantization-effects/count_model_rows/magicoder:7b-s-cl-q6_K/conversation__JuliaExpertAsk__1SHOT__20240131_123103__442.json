Here is an example of how you might define such a function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = combine(grouped, length => :counts)\n    return counts\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, `groupby` is used to group the DataFrame by the \"model\" column. The `combine` function then calculates the length of each group (i.e., for each model), and returns a new DataFrame where each row represents a unique model and its count. \n\nFor example, if you have a DataFrame with columns [\"model\", \"price\", \"year\"] and you call `count_model_rows(df)`, it will return a new DataFrame with columns [\"model\", \"counts\"]. Each row in this output DataFrame represents a unique model from the original DataFrame, and its corresponding count of rows.","status":200,"tokens":[0,226],"elapsed":2.155621775,"_type":"aimessage"}]
