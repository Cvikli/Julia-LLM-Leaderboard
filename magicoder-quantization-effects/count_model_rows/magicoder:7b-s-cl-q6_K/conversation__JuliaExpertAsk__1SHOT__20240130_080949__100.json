The function `combine` takes as input the grouped object and a function that should be applied to each group. In this case, we are using the built-in `length` function to count the number of rows in each group (i.e., for each model). \n\nThe output will be another DataFrame with columns \"model\" and \"count\". The value in 'count' column represents how many rows there are for that particular model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,183],"elapsed":1.759379405,"_type":"aimessage"}]
