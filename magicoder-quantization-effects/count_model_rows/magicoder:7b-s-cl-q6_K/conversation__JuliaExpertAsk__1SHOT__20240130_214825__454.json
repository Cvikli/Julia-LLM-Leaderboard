The result is returned as a dictionary where keys are unique models and values are their respective counts. \n\nPlease note that this code assumes you have pandas library installed in your environment, if not then install it using pip:\n```bash\npip install pandas\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,218],"elapsed":2.063722193,"_type":"aimessage"}]
