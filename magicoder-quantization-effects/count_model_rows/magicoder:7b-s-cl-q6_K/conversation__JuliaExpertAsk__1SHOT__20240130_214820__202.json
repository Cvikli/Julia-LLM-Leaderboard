The result is a new DataFrame where each row represents a unique model from the original DataFrame, and the `count` column contains the number of rows in that model's group.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", \"A\", \"B\"])  # Example dataframe\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,225],"elapsed":2.131728068,"_type":"aimessage"}]
