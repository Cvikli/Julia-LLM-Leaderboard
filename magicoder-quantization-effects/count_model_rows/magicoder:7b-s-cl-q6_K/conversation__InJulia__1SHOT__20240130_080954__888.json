Here is a simple function that does this:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Query\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    return nrow.(grouped)\nend\n```\nThe `groupby` function groups the dataframe based on the 'model' column. The result is a GroupedDataFrame object which is an iterator of SubDataFrame objects (one for each unique value in the 'model' column). Each SubDataFrame represents a group and you can operate on it like any regular DataFrame. In this case, we use the `nrow` function to count how many rows are in each SubDataFrame which gives us the number of observations for each model.\n\nPlease make sure that you have the DataFrames.jl package installed in your Julia environment and then call this function passing your DataFrame as a parameter.","status":200,"tokens":[59,246],"elapsed":2.3875463,"_type":"aimessage"}]
