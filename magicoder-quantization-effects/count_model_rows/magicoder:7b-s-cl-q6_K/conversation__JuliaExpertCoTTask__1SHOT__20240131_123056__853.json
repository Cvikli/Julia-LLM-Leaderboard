Then it calculates the length of each group, which gives us the count of rows for each model. The `combine` function is used to apply a function (in this case, calculating the length) to each group and combine the results into a new DataFrame. Finally, we rename the resulting column to :count => x so that it has a clear name.","status":200,"tokens":[0,235],"elapsed":2.259962995,"_type":"aimessage"}]
