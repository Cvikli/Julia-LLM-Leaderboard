Then `combine` is used to calculate the number of rows for each group. The result is a new DataFrame where each row represents one model and has a column named 'count' that holds the number of rows for that model.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", \"G\"]) # Create a test DataFrame\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nshow(counts, allcols=true)\n```\nThis will display the counts of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,233],"elapsed":2.222377018,"_type":"aimessage"}]
