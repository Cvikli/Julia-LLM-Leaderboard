Then, we use the `combine` function to create a new DataFrame where each row is a combination of the grouped values (in this case just the count of rows) and the result of applying the `nrow` function to that group.\n\nYou can call your function with the provided DataFrame:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\ndisplay(counts)\n```\nThis will output a new DataFrame with one column `nrow` containing the counts of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,243],"elapsed":2.335691769,"_type":"aimessage"}]
