Then we define a function `count_model_rows` that takes a DataFrame as its argument. Inside the function, we use the `groupby` function to group our data by the `model` column and then use `combine` to calculate the count of rows in each group. The `length => (:counts)` part tells the function to create a new column named \"counts\" that contains the length (number of rows) for each group. Finally, we call this function on our `df_cars` DataFrame and print out the result.\n\nIn case you want to get a DataFrame grouped by car model with counts instead of as separate columns, you could modify the function like so:\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return combine(groupby(df, :model), nrow => \"count\")\nend\n\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,352],"elapsed":2.821073877,"_type":"aimessage"}]
