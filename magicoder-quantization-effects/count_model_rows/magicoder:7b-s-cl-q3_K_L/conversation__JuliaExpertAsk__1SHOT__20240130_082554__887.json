Here's an example of how to define such a function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    return [count(grouped[i]) for i in 1:ngroups(grouped)]\nend\n```\nThis function first uses the `groupby` function to organize rows by their `model`. Then it uses a list comprehension to iterate over each group, calculate the number of rows (`count`) and store these counts into an array.\n\nLet's test this function with some example data:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model = [\"Tesla Model S\", \"Tesla Model 3\", \"BMW X5\", \"BMW X5\", \"Audi R8\"])\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis should return `[2, 1, 1]`, indicating that there are 2 rows for the Tesla Model S model and 1 row each for BMW X5 and Audi R8.","status":200,"tokens":[0,262],"elapsed":2.095952758,"_type":"aimessage"}]
