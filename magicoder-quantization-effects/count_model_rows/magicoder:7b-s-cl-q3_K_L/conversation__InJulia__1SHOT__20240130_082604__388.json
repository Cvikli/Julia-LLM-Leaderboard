Then import DataFrames from whereever your script is running using using DataFrames.\n\nHere's how we could define such a function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    # Group data by model and calculate the number of rows for each group\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = combine(grouped, length => \"counts\")\n\n    return counts\nend\n```\n\nYou can now call this function with your DataFrame `df_cars`:\n\n```julia\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will return a new DataFrame where each row represents a unique model from the original DataFrame and the value in the \"counts\" column is the number of rows for that specific model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,215],"elapsed":1.713256131,"_type":"aimessage"}]
