Here is an example of how you could define such a function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    \n    return nrow.(grouped)\nend\n```\n\nIn this code snippet, we first use `groupby` function from the DataFrames package to divide our DataFrame into groups based on the `model`. Then we call the `nrow` function on each of these grouped data frames which gives us the number of rows in each group. The result is a Vector where the i-th element represents the count of rows for the i-th model.\n\nLet's say you have a DataFrame df_cars with columns 'model', 'price', and 'year'. You can apply this function to it like so:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model = [\"BMW\", \"Ford\", \"Toyota\", \"Honda\", \"BMW\"], \n                    price = [5000, 3000, 2000, 1500, 4000], \n                    year = [2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2020])\n\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThis will return a Vector of counts: `[3, 1]` which indicates that there are 3 rows for the \"BMW\" model and 1 row for the \"Ford\" model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,368],"elapsed":2.94638283,"_type":"aimessage"}]
