The pipe operator `|>` is then used to perform operations on each group. Here it's used to get the number of rows in each group (i.e., for each unique model). Finally, `collect` converts the result from an array of vectors into a single vector.\n\nThis function will return an Array where the index is the 'model' column and the value at that index is the count of rows for that model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,239],"elapsed":1.913829558,"_type":"aimessage"}]
