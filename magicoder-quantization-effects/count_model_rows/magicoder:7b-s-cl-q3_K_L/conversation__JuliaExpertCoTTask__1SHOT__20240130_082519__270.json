Then we calculate the number of rows in each group with `size`. We create a vector of these sizes and return it as the result.\n\nNow let's test this function using your example:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n\n# Print the result\nprintln.(result)\n```\nThe result for your example should be:\n```julia\n2 1 2\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,248],"elapsed":2.026620871,"_type":"aimessage"}]
