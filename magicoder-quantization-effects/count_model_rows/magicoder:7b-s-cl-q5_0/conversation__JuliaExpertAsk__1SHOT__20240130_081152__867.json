Here is a simple example:\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = mapreduce(groupby_sum, identity, grouped)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `groupby` function from DataFrames.jl package to create a GroupedDataFrame which is used with `mapreduce`. The `groupby_sum` function computes the sum for each group and `identity` keeps the dimension of the result as a DataFrame (as opposed to Vector). \n\nYou can call this function like so:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\"])\ncounts = count_model_rows(df)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,190],"elapsed":1.623122323,"_type":"aimessage"}]
