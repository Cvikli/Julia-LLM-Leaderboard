Here is an example of such function in Julia. \n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames: countmap, groupby, nrow\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    df = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n    return [nrow(x) for x in df]\nend\n```\n\nThis function works as follows: \n\n1. It uses the `groupby` function from the DataFrames package to group your data by 'model'. This returns a GroupedDataFrame object which is similar to a regular DataFrame but has additional information about how it's grouped and what operations can be performed on it.\n2. The `nrow` function then calculates the number of rows in each group. \n3. Finally, it converts this into a list (an array in Julia terminology) with list comprehension `[... for ...]`.\n\nYou can call this function like this:\n```julia\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln.(keys(counts), counts)\n```\nThis will print out the unique 'model' names and their corresponding row counts.","status":200,"tokens":[0,259],"elapsed":2.227771385,"_type":"aimessage"}]
