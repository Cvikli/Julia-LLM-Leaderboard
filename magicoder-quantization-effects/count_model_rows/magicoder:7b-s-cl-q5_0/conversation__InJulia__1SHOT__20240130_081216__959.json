Here's an example:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n    counts = [size(group)[1] for group in grouped]\n    return counts\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a DataFrame and returns an array of integers. The integer at index i represents the number of rows in the ith group (which represents a specific model). You can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[1, 2, 3, 2, 3], other=[4, 5, 6, 7, 8])\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprint(counts) # Output: [2, 2, 1]\n```\n\nThis output means that there are 2 rows for model 1, 2 rows for model 2, and 1 row for model 3.","status":200,"tokens":[0,255],"elapsed":2.167742692,"_type":"aimessage"}]
