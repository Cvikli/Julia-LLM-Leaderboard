Here is an example of such a function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    grouped = groupby(df_cars, :model)  # Group the data by model column\n    counts = []  # Initialize an empty array to store counts for each model\n\n    for group in grouped\n        push!(counts, size(group)[1])  # For each group, append its number of rows to counts array\n    end\n    \n    return counts\nend\n```\nThis function groups the DataFrame by the `model` column and then for each group (which corresponds to a specific model), it calculates how many rows there are. The result is stored in an array where the i-th element represents the number of rows for the i-th unique model found in `df_cars`. \n\nRemember to add your data to this function before using it, and also remember to handle possible errors (like if a column called \"model\" doesn't exist), since this is a simple example.","status":200,"tokens":[0,256],"elapsed":2.185454876,"_type":"aimessage"}]
