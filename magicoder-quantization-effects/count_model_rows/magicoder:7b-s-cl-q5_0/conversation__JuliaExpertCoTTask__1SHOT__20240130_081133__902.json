Then it applies nrow to each of these groups, which counts the number of rows in that group. \n\nYou can then call this function on your DataFrame:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln.(counts)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```julia\n2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n```\n\nThese are the counts of rows for each unique model in `df_cars`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,234],"elapsed":2.012250605,"_type":"aimessage"}]
