Finally, we select only the 'model' and 'count' columns using the `select` function. \n\nYou can call this function like this:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"A\", \"B\"], other=[1,2,3,4,5])\ndf_count = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n`df_count` will then contain a new dataframe with one row for each unique value in the `model` column, and a `count` column showing how many times that model appeared in the original dataframe.","status":200,"tokens":[0,290],"elapsed":2.496537301,"_type":"aimessage"}]
