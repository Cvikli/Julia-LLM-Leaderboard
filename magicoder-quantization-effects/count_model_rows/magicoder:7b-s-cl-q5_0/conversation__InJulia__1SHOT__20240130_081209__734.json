Then it defines a function that takes this DataFrame and groups by `model` column. For each group, it calculates the number of rows and stores them into a dictionary. Finally, it applies the function to our DataFrame df_cars and prints out how many rows are there for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,355],"elapsed":3.039552618,"_type":"aimessage"}]
