It then applies the `nrow` function to each of these groups, which returns the number of rows in that group (which is equivalent to counting how many instances there are of a particular model). The result is returned as an array of integers, where the i-th integer represents the count of models found in the DataFrame.\n\nYou can call this function like so:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThis will output `[2, 1, 2]`, indicating that there are 2 instances of 'a4', one instance of 'a6', and two instances of 'q7' in the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,260],"elapsed":1.981914794,"_type":"aimessage"}]
