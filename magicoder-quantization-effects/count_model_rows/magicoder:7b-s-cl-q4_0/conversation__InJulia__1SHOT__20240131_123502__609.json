Then it uses a `map` operation to apply a function to each group that calculates the number of rows in that group (i.e., the size of the group). The result is returned as a Vector of integers, where each integer represents the count for one model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,149],"elapsed":1.11789903,"_type":"aimessage"}]
