If it doesn't, you will need to adjust the code accordingly. Similarly, if your DataFrame is not sorted by model, the results might be misleading or incorrect because `groupby` groups consecutive rows with the same value in the specified column together.\n\nIf you want to count all rows regardless of model, you can use:\n```julia\nfunction count_all_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return nrow(df)\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,209],"elapsed":1.572077593,"_type":"aimessage"}]
