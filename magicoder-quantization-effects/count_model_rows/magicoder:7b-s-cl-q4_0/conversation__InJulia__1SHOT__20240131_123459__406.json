The `combine` function then calculates the number of rows in each group (i.e., for each unique model). The result is a new DataFrame where each row represents a unique model and the count of rows for that model.\n\nMake sure to add `using DataFrames, CategoricalArrays` at the beginning of your script if they are not already imported.","status":200,"tokens":[0,208],"elapsed":1.557078765,"_type":"aimessage"}]
