The result is a new DataFrame where each row represents a unique value in the 'model' column and the number of rows for that model. \n\nYou can call this function with your DataFrame as follows:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"B\", \"A\"]) # example DataFrame\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThe `result` will be a new DataFrame where each row represents a unique value in the 'model' column and the number of rows for that model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,238],"elapsed":1.831864783,"_type":"aimessage"}]
