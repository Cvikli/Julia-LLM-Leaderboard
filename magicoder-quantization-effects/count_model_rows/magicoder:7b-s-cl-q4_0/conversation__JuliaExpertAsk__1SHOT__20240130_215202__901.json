Then it applies a combination operation on each group using the `combine` function that sums up the number of rows in each group (i.e., for each unique value in the `:model` column). The result is returned as a new DataFrame where each row represents a unique model and its count of rows.\n\nYou can call this function with your DataFrame like so:\n```julia\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[90,198],"elapsed":1.480596458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
