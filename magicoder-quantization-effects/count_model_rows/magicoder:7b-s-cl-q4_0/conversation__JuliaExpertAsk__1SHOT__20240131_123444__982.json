Here is an example of such a function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Counter\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    counts = groupby(df, :model) |> combine(:model => length => \"count\")\n    return counts\nend\n```\n\nThis function groups the rows of `df` by their `model`, then combines each group with a single row that has just one column: the count of rows in that group.\n\nYou can use it like this:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\"])\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nNow `counts` is a new DataFrame with columns `:model` and `:count`. Each row in this DataFrame corresponds to a unique model from the original DataFrame, and the value of `:count` indicates how many rows had that model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,247],"elapsed":1.854726102,"_type":"aimessage"}]
