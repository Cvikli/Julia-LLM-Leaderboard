The function `nrow()` is then used to count the number of rows (or data instances) within each group. \n\nHere's how that could look:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped_df = groupby(df, :model)\n    \n    model_counts = Dict()\n    \n    for group in grouped_df\n        model_name = getfield(group[1],:model) # assuming that the column \"model\" is a Symbol\n        n = length(group)\n        \n        model_counts[model_name] = n\n    end\n    \n    return model_counts\nend\n```\n\nYou can then call `count_model_rows(df_cars)` to get the counts of each car model in your DataFrame. The function returns a dictionary where the keys are the unique values in the \"model\" column, and the values are their respective counts.","status":200,"tokens":[0,256],"elapsed":1.914974394,"_type":"aimessage"}]
