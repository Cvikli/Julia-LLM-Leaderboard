Here is a simple implementation of the problem:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames # Ensure you have installed and added this package to your project\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return groupby(df, :model) |> nrow\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, `groupby()` groups the rows of a data frame by one or more columns. Here we are grouping by the column named \"model\". Then `nrow` gives us the number of rows for each group, i.e., for each unique value in the \"model\" column. The result is returned as a DataFrame where the rows correspond to unique values in the \"model\" column and the columns corresponds to the counts of these values.\n  \nYou can use this function like:\n```julia\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will return a DataFrame where each row corresponds to a different model (e.g., \"Ford\", \"Toyota\", etc.) and the column values correspond to how many rows there are for this model in `df_cars`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,267],"elapsed":2.002397467,"_type":"aimessage"}]
