Here is an example:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = combine(grouped, nrow => first)\n    return counts\nend\n```\nIn this function, `groupby` groups the dataframe by the column 'model', and `combine` calculates the number of rows in each group (i.e., for each unique model). The result is a new dataframe where each row represents one unique model, and its corresponding count of rows.","status":200,"tokens":[0,146],"elapsed":1.08914533,"_type":"aimessage"}]
