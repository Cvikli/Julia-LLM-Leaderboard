The `combine` function then calculates the number of rows in each group (i.e., for each unique model). The result is a new DataFrame where each row represents a unique model, and there's a column \"count\" that indicates how many rows there were for that model.\n\nPlease note that you need to have the `DataFrames` package installed in your Julia environment to use this function. If it's not already installed, you can add it using the Pkg REPL mode:\n```julia\n]add DataFrames\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,235],"elapsed":1.722495396,"_type":"aimessage"}]
