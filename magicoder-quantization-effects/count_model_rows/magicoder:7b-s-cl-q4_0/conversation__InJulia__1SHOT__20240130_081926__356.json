Here is an example:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, CategoricalArrays\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n    model_counts = DataFrame() # to store the counts of each model\n    \n    for grp in grouped\n        row = [grp.colname[1] => nrow(grp)]\n        push!(model_counts, row)\n    end\n\n    return model_counts\nend\n```\nIn this function, we are creating a new DataFrame `model_counts` to store the counts for each model. For each group in the grouped data, we extract the first column name of the group (the `model`) and count the number of rows using `nrow`. This count is then added as a row to `model_counts`. At the end, we return this DataFrame containing counts for each model. \n\nPlease note that you should have the \"DataFrames\" package installed in your Julia environment. You can add it using `Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\")` if it's not already installed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,312],"elapsed":2.343418059,"_type":"aimessage"}]
