Then it maps over each group in the DataFrame and calculates the number of rows in that group (which is equivalent to counting the number of elements in the first element of the group). \n\nPlease note, this assumes your data frame has a column named \"model\". If you have a different name for the column, replace `:model` with the appropriate symbol.","status":200,"tokens":[0,189],"elapsed":1.385891638,"_type":"aimessage"}]
