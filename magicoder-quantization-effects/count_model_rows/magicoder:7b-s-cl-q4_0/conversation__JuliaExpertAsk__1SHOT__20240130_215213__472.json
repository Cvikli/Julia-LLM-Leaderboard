The `@transform` macro is used to create a new column that consists of ones, which will allow us to count the number of rows in each group. Finally, we use the `sum` function to calculate the total number of rows for each model.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"A\", \"B\"])\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will return a `Dict` where the keys are the unique model names and the values are the number of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,239],"elapsed":1.75556847,"_type":"aimessage"}]
