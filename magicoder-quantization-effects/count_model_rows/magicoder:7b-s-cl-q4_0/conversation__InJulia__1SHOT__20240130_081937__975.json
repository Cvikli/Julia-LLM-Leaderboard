This will return a dictionary where keys are car models and values are number of occurrences. \n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, CategoricalArrays\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = Dict()\n    for (model, df_grouped) in grouped\n        counts[model] = nrow(df_grouped)\n    end\n    return counts\nend\n```\nHere is how you can use the function:\n\n```julia\n# Assuming we have a DataFrame df_cars with columns \"model\" and \"other columns\".\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nfor (model, count) in counts\n    println(\"Model: $model, Count: $count\")\nend\n```\nThis will print each car model along with the number of rows for that specific model. \n\nNote: This function assumes that all values in column \"model\" are unique and non-missing. If there can be duplicate models (same model but different data), you should use `groupby(df, :model, sort=true)` to ensure that each group is a unique instance of the model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,284],"elapsed":2.128545166,"_type":"aimessage"}]
