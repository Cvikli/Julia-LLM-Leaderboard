Here is an example:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = map(x -> length(x), grouped)\n    return counts\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a DataFrame as input, groups the data by 'model', and then applies the `length` function to each group. The result is a new DataFrame where each row corresponds to a unique model in your original DataFrame, and the value in that row is the number of rows for that model.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will return a new DataFrame where each row corresponds to a unique model in `df_cars`, and the value in that row is the number of rows for that model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,244],"elapsed":1.788780998,"_type":"aimessage"}]
