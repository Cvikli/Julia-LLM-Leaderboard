Below is an example of a function named `count_model_rows`. It assumes that `df_cars` is a DataFrame and 'model' is a column in the DataFrame:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Counter\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    model_counts = DataFrame(model=collect(keys(Counter(df_cars[:model]))), \n                           counts=collect(values(Counter(df_cars[:model]))))\nend\n```\n\nYou can then call this function like: `count_model_rows(df_cars)`\n\nThis function first uses the Counter package to count the frequency of each model, and then turns these frequencies into a DataFrame for further analysis. This DataFrame contains two columns: one named 'model' containing all the unique models in the DataFrame and another named 'counts', containing the corresponding counts of rows per model.\n\nPlease note that you need to install the Counter package if it is not installed yet using `]add Counter`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,253],"elapsed":1.89390002,"_type":"aimessage"}]
