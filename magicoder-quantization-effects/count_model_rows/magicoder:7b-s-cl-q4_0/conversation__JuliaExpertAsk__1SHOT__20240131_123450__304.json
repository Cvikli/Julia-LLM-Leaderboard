It then groups data by model using the `.groupby()` method and calculates the size (number of rows) for each group with the `.size()` method. The counts are stored in a dictionary where the keys are the models and the values are the counts.\n\nThe defaultdict is used to handle cases where a model does not exist in the DataFrame but it still returns 0 as count for that model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,293],"elapsed":2.21141554,"_type":"aimessage"}]
