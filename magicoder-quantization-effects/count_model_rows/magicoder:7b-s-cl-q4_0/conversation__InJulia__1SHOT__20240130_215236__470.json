It then iterates over each group and appends the number of rows in that group (which is obtained using the `size` function) to a Vector of Int, which it returns at the end.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that your data frame has a column named \"model\". If you have a different name for your model column, replace `:model` with the appropriate string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,216],"elapsed":1.581883936,"_type":"aimessage"}]
