The result is a new DataFrame with columns for `model` and `count`. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes your DataFrame's column names are consistent. If your actual DataFrame has different column names, you would need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,203],"elapsed":1.77729571,"_type":"aimessage"}]
