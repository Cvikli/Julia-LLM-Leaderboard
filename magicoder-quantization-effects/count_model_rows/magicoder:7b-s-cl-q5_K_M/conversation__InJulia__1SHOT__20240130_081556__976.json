Here's how it would look:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    df_count = groupby(df_cars, :model) |>\n        @transform(:nrow = nrow .+ 1) |>\n        select(_, Not(:model))\n    return df_count\nend\n```\nIn the above code:\n- We define a function called `count_model_rows` that takes as input a DataFrame named `df_cars`.\n- Inside this function, we use the `groupby` function to group the rows of `df_cars` by the values in the `:model` column.\n- The `@transform` macro is then used to create a new column in the grouped dataframe which counts the number of rows for each model (the result will be one more than the actual row number as it starts from 1).\n- We then select all columns except the `:model` column using `select(_, Not(:model))`. The `|>` symbol is used to pass the output of the previous operation to `@transform`.\n- Finally, we return the modified dataframe.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,318],"elapsed":2.726069848,"_type":"aimessage"}]
