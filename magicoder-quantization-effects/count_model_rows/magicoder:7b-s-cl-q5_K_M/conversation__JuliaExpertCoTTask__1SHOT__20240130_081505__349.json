The result is a new DataFrame where every row represents a unique value from the `:model` column and its corresponding count. \n\nYou can use it with your data like this:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will output a new DataFrame with two columns: `Symbol` and `nrow`. The first column contains the unique models from the original DataFrame, and the second column contains the number of times each model appears in the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,263],"elapsed":2.306224421,"_type":"aimessage"}]
