Here is a simple example:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, DataFramesMeta\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return df |> @groupby(:model) |> @transform(_.nrow)\nend\n```\nIn this function, `|>` is the \"pipe\" operator which takes the output of the left side and feeds it into the next operation (in this case `@groupby` and `@transform`). `:model` specifies that we want to group by the `model` column. `.nrow` computes the number of rows in each group.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"Mazda\", \"Toyota\", \"Honda\", \"Toyota\", \"Ford\"])\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis would return a new dataframe where the `model` column is grouped and for each group, it contains the number of rows. For instance:\n\n```julia\n4x4 DataFrame\n│ Row │ model   │ nrow  │\n├─────┼─────────┼───────┤\n│ 1   │ Mazda   │ 1     │\n│ 2   │ Toyota  │ 2     │\n│ 3   │ Honda   │ 1     │\n│ 4   │ Ford    │ 1     │\n```\nThis shows that there is one row with `Mazda` as the model, two rows with `Toyota`, etc.","status":200,"tokens":[0,393],"elapsed":3.362322789,"_type":"aimessage"}]
