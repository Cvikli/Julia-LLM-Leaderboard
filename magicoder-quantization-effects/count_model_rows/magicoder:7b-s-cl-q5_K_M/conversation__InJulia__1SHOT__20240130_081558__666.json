Unfortunately, currently there is no in-built equivalent of Python's pandas library in Julia. You might want to install Tables.jl or other similar libraries if needed.\n\nHowever, here is an example using Tables.jl:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Tables\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    \n    for (k, v) in grouped \n        println(\"Model $(k): $(length(v)) rows\")\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function `count_model_rows` will iterate over each model in the DataFrame and print out how many rows there are for that model. Please note that this is a basic example and may not work directly if your DataFrame does not have a `:model` column. \n\nYou also need to make sure you load `Tables` and `DataFrames` packages before running above code as they are required for the function.\n\nIf you're working with big data, this might not be an optimal solution due to memory constraints. In such case, we can use SQL-like operations supported by some databases like SQLite.","status":200,"tokens":[0,276],"elapsed":2.393483063,"_type":"aimessage"}]
