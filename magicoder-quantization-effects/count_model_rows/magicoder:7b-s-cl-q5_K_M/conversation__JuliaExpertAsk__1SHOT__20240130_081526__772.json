The resulting output is a new dataframe where every row is one model's count of rows in the original dataframe.\n\nUsage example:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"A\", \"C\"]) # Sample data frame\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\ndisplay(result) # To print the resultant DataFrame\n```\nThis would return a new dataframe with two rows: one for model \"A\" and another for model \"C\". The counts of rows will be 2 and 1 respectively.","status":200,"tokens":[0,297],"elapsed":2.595682038,"_type":"aimessage"}]
