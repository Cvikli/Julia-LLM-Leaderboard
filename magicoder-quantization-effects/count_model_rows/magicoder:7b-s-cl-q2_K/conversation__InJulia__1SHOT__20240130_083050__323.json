Here's an example:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\ndf_cars = DataFrame(A = [\"Honda\", \"Toyota\", \"Honda\", \"Ford\", \"Honda\"], B = 1:5)\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame, colname::Symbol)\n    df_grouped = groupby(df, colname)\n    return map(x -> length(x), df_grouped)\nend\n\nlengths = count_model_rows(df_cars, :A)\n```\n\nThis will give you a dictionary with keys as unique model names and values as the number of rows for each. If you want it in a DataFrame form, you can convert it:\n\n```julia\nresulting_df = DataFrames.DataFrame(lengths)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,239],"elapsed":1.787036126,"_type":"aimessage"}]
