Then it goes through each unique model and counts how many rows there are for that specific model. This count is then added as a new row to the resulting DataFrame.\n\nRemember to make sure that you have the necessary packages installed in your Julia environment:\n```julia\nPkg.add([\n  \"DataFrames\",\n])\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,226],"elapsed":1.705661262,"_type":"aimessage"}]
