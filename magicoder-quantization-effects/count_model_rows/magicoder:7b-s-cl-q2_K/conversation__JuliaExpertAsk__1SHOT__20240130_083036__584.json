For each model, it checks if there's an entry for that model in the `counts` dictionary; if not, it adds 1 to the count for that model. If there is already an entry, it just increments the count by one. The function finally returns this `counts` dictionary.","status":200,"tokens":[0,260],"elapsed":1.947537528,"_type":"aimessage"}]
