Here's how you could implement `count_model_rows`.\n\nFirst install the required package:\n```julia\nusing Pkg \nPkg.add(\"DataFrames\")\n```\nThen, define your function:\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    models = unique(df.model) # get a list of unique car models\n    model_counts = Dict() \n    \n    for model in models\n        model_rows = df[df.model .== model, :]\n        count = size(model_rows)[1]\n        model_counts[model] = count\n    end\n    \n    return model_counts\nend\n```\n\nThis function will go through each unique car model in the DataFrame and calculate how many rows there are for that specific model. It will then store these counts in a Dictionary with the models as keys and their respective row counts as values.\n\nNote: In Julia, indexing into a dataframe is done using curly braces `{}` notation rather than square brackets `[ ]`. For example, to get all rows where the 'model' column equals `Mercedes`, you would write `df[df.model .== \"Mercedes\", :]`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,298],"elapsed":2.244847871,"_type":"aimessage"}]
