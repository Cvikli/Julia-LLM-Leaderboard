Then, it iterates through all the unique models in the DataFrame, calculates the count of rows for that model, and stores it in the dictionary with the model as the key. Finally, it returns the dictionary of counts.\n\nThis function assumes you have a DataFrame `df_cars` where each row represents a car and the 'model' column contains the name of the model of that car.","status":200,"tokens":[0,216],"elapsed":1.613765839,"_type":"aimessage"}]
