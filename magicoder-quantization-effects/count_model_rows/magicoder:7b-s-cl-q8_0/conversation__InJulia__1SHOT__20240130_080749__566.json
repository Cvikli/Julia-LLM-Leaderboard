Then, here is an example of a function called `count_model_rows` that can be used:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    count_df = combine(grouped, nrow => \"Count\" )\nend\n```\nHere, `groupby` function is used to create a GroupedDataFrame. After grouping by 'model', the `combine` function is used to apply a function along each group which in this case calculates the number of rows for each model (`nrow`). The resultant dataframe `count_df` has two columns: one for the unique models from original DataFrame and another with count of rows for each model.\n\nExample usage would look like below:\n\n```julia\n# Assuming df_cars is your DataFrame containing 'model' column\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,244],"elapsed":2.716619207,"_type":"aimessage"}]
