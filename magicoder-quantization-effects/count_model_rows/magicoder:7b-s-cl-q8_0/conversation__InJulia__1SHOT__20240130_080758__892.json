Here is how you could do it:\n\nFirstly, make sure to install the necessary packages using Pkg.add(\"DataFramesMeta\"). Then add the following code into your Julia script:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, DataFramesMeta\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return by(df, :model => count)\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, `by` is used to group the dataframe by column 'model' and then `count` is applied on each group to give you the number of rows in that particular group. The resultant DataFrame would have two columns - \"model\" (the name of the model) and \"x\" (the count of rows for each model).\n\nHere is an example usage:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, CSV\ndf_cars = CSV.read(\"path/to/your/file.csv\") # Replace with your file path\nresultant_DataFrame = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,282],"elapsed":3.137051101,"_type":"aimessage"}]
