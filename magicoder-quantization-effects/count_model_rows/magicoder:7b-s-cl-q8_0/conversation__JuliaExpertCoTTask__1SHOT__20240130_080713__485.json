Here is how you can implement your function:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef count_model_rows(df):\n    # Group by 'model'\n    grouped = df.groupby('model')\n    \n    # Use a dictionary to store the counts\n    counts = defaultdict(int)\n    \n    # Loop through each group and get the size (number of rows in each group)\n    for name, group in grouped:\n        counts[name] = len(group)\n        \n    return dict(counts)\n```\n\nYou can then call your function with your DataFrame like this:\n\n```python\ndf_cars = pd.DataFrame(data={'model': [\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"]})\nprint(count_model_rows(df_cars))  # Outputs: {'a4': 3, 'a6': 1, 'q7': 1}\n```\nThis function returns a dictionary where the keys are the unique model names and the values are the corresponding counts.","status":200,"tokens":[0,274],"elapsed":3.106026425,"_type":"aimessage"}]
