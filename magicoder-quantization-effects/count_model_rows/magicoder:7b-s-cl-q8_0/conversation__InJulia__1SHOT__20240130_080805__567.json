Here is an example:\n\nFirstly, make sure to install the necessary packages using Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\") if not already installed. Now, we will proceed as follows:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, DataFramesMeta\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df_cars, :model) # groups data by model\n    return nrow.(grouped) # calculate the number of rows for each group\nend\n```\nThis function will return a DataFrame where each row represents the number of rows in a particular `model`. For example, if there are 3 rows with the `model` \"BMW\" and 2 rows with the model \"Mercedes\", the resulting DataFrame would look like:\n|    | model   | nrow |\n|----|---------|------|\n| 1  | BMW     | 3    |\n| 2  | Mercedes| 2    |\nThis means there are 3 rows for \"BMW\" model and 2 rows for the \"Mercedes\" model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,296],"elapsed":3.304758365,"_type":"aimessage"}]
