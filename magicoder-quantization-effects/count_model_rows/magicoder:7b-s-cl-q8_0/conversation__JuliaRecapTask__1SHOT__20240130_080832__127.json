X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame df_cars with column `model`, write a function `count_model_rows` that groups data by model and calculate how many rows there are for each.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use the DataFrames.jl package in Julia to work with data frames and perform operations on them, such as grouping and counting rows. \n\nHere is a possible implementation of `count_model_rows`:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames: DataFrame, groupby, count\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    return count(grouped)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `groupby` function to split the data frame into groups by `model`, and then counts the number of rows in each group with the `count` function.
