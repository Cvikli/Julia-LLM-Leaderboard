Then it applies the `transform` function to each group which transforms the grouped data into another DataFrame. In this case, we transform each group (i.e., each model) so that its new value is the number of rows in the group. \n\nYou can then call this function with your DataFrame like so:\n```julia\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will return a new DataFrame where each row represents a unique model, and the column contains how many rows are there for that model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,230],"elapsed":2.562112191,"_type":"aimessage"}]
