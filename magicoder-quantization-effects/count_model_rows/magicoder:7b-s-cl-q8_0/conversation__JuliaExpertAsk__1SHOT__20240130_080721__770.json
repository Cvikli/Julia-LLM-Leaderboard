It then uses the `nrow` function, which is a built-in function for finding the number of rows in each group, to count how many rows are in each group and return those counts as an array.\n\nHere's how you might use this function:\n\n```julia\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will give you an array where the i-th element is the number of rows in the i-th group of `df_cars`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,216],"elapsed":2.429388508,"_type":"aimessage"}]
