Then it uses the `combine` function to calculate the number of rows in each group and create a new column with this information. The result is a DataFrame that has one row for each unique model in the original DataFrame, and a new column named `count` showing how many times that model appears in the DataFrame.\n\nNow let's apply this function to your example:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n\n# The result will be a new DataFrame like this:\n# |   | model | count |\n# |---|-------|-------|\n# | 1 |    a4 |     3 |\n# | 2 |    a6 |     1 |\n# | 3 |    q7 |     1 |\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,290],"elapsed":3.29094087,"_type":"aimessage"}]
