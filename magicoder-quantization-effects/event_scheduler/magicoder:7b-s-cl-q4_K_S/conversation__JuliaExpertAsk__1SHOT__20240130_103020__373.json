Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    # Check if the list of events is empty\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    # Parse string dates to DateTime objects\n    parsed_events = map(DatePair, [parse.(DateTimeFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"), split(event[1], 'T')[1]) for event in events], \n                         [parse.(DateTimeFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"), split(event[2], 'T')[1]) for event in events])\n    \n    # Sort the events by their start times\n    sorted_events = sort(parsed_events, by=x->x.first)\n    \n    # Compare each event to its next one\n    for i in 1:length(sorted_events)-1\n        if sorted_events[i].second > sorted_events[i+1].first\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by parsing the dates from the event tuples into DateTime objects and then sorting them. It then compares each event's finish time to its next event's start time; if any overlap, it returns a conflict. If no events overlap, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,324],"elapsed":2.506975879,"_type":"aimessage"}]
