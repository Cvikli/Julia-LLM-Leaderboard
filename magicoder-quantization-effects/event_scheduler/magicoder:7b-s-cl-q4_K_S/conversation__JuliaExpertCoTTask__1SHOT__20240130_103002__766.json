Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is a Julia function that accomplishes this task. We'll make use of the `Dates` package to parse the time strings into DateTime objects which are easier to work with for comparisons and subtractions:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    times = Vector{DateTime}()  # To store the start and finish times for each event\n\n    for event in events\n        # Parse start time into DateTime object\n        start_time = DateTime(event[1], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n        \n        # Parse finish time into DateTime object\n        finish_time = DateTime(event[2], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n\n        push!(times, start_time)  # Push the start time into array\n        push!(times, finish_time)  # Push the finish time into array\n    end\n    \n    for i = 1:(length(times)-1)\n        if times[i+1] > times[i]   # If finish of one event is less than start of next event then there would be a conflict.\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"  # Return \"No conflicts\" when no conflict found i.e. finish time of any event is greater than the start time of next event.\nend\n```\n\nYou can test this function with your example like so:\n\n```julia\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,439],"elapsed":3.47410842,"_type":"aimessage"}]
