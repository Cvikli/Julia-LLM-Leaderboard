Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

We use the helper function `overlap` to check if two events overlap in time. The `DateTime` type from Dates package is used to parse the time strings into DateTime format. \n\nThe main logic of the code is implemented inside the loop where it compares each event with every other event starting from the next one. If there's an overlap, the function will immediately return \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of events, it will return \"No conflicts\". \n\nThe function also handles the case when the list of events is empty by returning \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,414],"elapsed":3.267650387,"_type":"aimessage"}]
