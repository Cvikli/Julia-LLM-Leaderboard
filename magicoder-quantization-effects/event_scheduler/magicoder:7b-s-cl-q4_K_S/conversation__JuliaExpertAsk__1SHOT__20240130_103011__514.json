Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you might write this `event_scheduler` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{DateTime, DateTime}})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    for i in 1:(length(events)-1)\n        start_i, finish_i = events[i]\n        for j in (i+1):length(events)\n            start_j, finish_j = events[j]\n            \n            if !(finish_i < start_j || finish_j < start_i)\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function iterates over the list of events and checks each pair of events for a conflict. If any two events overlap, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs, it returns \"No conflicts\". If the event list is empty, it correctly returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[153,241],"elapsed":1.890338788,"_type":"aimessage"}]
