Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

First, we need to import the Dates package which provides utilities for handling dates and times:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n```\nThe function `event_scheduler` takes an array of tuples representing the events' start and finish times. It uses a nested loop to check for overlaps in the timings of any two consecutive events. \n\nIf there are no overlaps, it returns \"No conflicts\". If there is at least one overlap, it returns \"Conflict\".\n\n```julia\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    for i in 1:(length(events)-1)\n        start1 = DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")(events[i][1])\n        finish1 = DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")(events[i][2])\n        \n        for j in (i+1):length(events)\n            start2 = DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")(events[j][1])\n            finish2 = DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")(events[j][2])\n            \n            if !((start2 > finish1) || (start1 > finish2)) \n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThe `event_scheduler` function compares the start and finish times of each event with every other event. If there is an overlap between any two events, it returns \"Conflict\".","status":200,"tokens":[343,373],"elapsed":4.566402733,"_type":"aimessage"}]
