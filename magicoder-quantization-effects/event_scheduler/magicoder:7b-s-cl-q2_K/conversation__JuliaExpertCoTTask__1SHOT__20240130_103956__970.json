Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If it's not, then it sorts all the events based on their starting time. It then iterates over each event and compares its ending time with the next event's starting time. If they overlap in any way (either a complete overlap or an overlap only on their end times), it returns \"Conflict\". If there are no conflicts, it returns \"No conflicts\".\nThe function also checks if two events have overlapping end times and only then returns \"Conflict\" to avoid false positives.","status":200,"tokens":[343,320],"elapsed":3.671891058,"_type":"aimessage"}]
