Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is a Julia solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Array)\n    if isempty(events) \n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    sorted_events = sort(events, by=x -> DateTime(x[1]))\n    \n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events), j in 1:i-1\n        # if the start time of one event is after the finish time of another, it means there's a conflict\n        if sorted_events[i][1] > sorted_events[j][2]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n``` \nThis solution first checks whether the array of events is empty. If it is, it returns \"No events\". \n\nNext, it sorts the list of events based on their start times. This ensures that all the overlapping events are placed together in the sorted array. \n\nThen, for each event (i), it checks whether its start time (sorted_events[i][1]) is after the finish time of any previous event (any sorted_events[j][2] where j<i). If this condition holds true, there exists a conflict among the events. In such case, it returns \"Conflict\". \n\nFinally, if no conflict has been found for all events, it returns \"No conflicts\". \n\nYou can test this function with some data like this:\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2021-05-30 09:00\", \"2021-05-30 11:00\"), (\"2021-05-30 08:00\", \"2021-05-30 10:00\"), (\"2021-05-30 07:00\", \"2021-05-30 09:00\")]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events)) # should print \"Conflict\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,468],"elapsed":3.551783784,"_type":"aimessage"}]
