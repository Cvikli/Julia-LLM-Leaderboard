[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If it's empty, we simply return 'No events'.\n- Otherwise, we sort the events by their start times.\n- We initialize the `previous_end` variable with the end time of the first event in sorted order.\n- Then we iterate over the sorted array from the second element onwards. For each event, if its start time is less than `previous_end`, it means there's a conflict as both events are scheduled at the same time. Thus, we return 'Conflict'. Otherwise, we update `previous_end` to be maximum of previous `previous_end` and current end time.\n- If we have checked all the events and found no conflicts, we return 'No conflicts'.","status":200,"tokens":[0,365],"elapsed":2.853430103,"_type":"aimessage"}]
