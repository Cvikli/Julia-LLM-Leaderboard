Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If an event starts before the previous one ends, there is a conflict. If it does not, but the next one starts after the previous one ends, there might be an overlap. If none of this applies, it means there are no conflicts. Note that if two events finish at exactly the same time, we treat them as a potential overlap because one event started after the other ended.","status":200,"tokens":[0,300],"elapsed":2.29652021,"_type":"aimessage"}]
