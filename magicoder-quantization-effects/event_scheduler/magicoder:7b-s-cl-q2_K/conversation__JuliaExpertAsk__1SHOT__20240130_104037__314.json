Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Python solution using the `Dates` package:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nimport Dates\n\ndef event_scheduler(events: List[Tuple[str, str]]) -> str:\n    if not events:\n        return \"No events\"\n    \n    sorted_events = sorted(events, key=lambda x: Dates.DateTime(x[0], x[1]))\n    \n    for i in range(len(sorted_events) - 1):\n        event1 = sorted_events[i]\n        event2 = sorted_events[i+1]\n        \n        if Dates.DateTime(event1[1]) > Dates.DateTime(event2[0]) or (Dates.DateTime(event2[0]) == Dates.DateTime(event1[1]) and i+1 == len(sorted_events)-1):\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        \n    return \"No conflicts\"\n```\n\nThe function `event_scheduler` first checks if the list of events is empty. If it's not, it sorts the list by start time of the events. Then for each consecutive pair of events (i and i+1), it compares their end times. If an event ends after another one starts or they have the same start time but are not the last event, we consider them as conflicting because they overlap in time. In case all events do not overlap, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,322],"elapsed":2.429721162,"_type":"aimessage"}]
