Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If an overlap is found, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If the function has gone through all pairs without finding an overlap, it concludes there are no conflicts and returns \"No conflicts\". If the list of events is empty, it also returns \"No events\".\n\nRemember to import `Dates` package before running this code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,313],"elapsed":2.811592639,"_type":"aimessage"}]
