Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple implementation of your task:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    # Check if there are any events to begin with\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    # Sort the events by start time\n    sorted_events = sort!(events, lt = (a, b) -> a[1] < b[1])\n\n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        current_event = sorted_events[i]\n        previous_event = sorted_events[i - 1]\n        \n        # If the start of this event is before the end of the previous event, there's a conflict\n        if parsedate(current_event[1]) < parsedate(previous_event[2])\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # No conflicts found\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks whether the list of events is empty. If so, it returns \"No events\". Then it sorts the events by their start time and iterates over them in order. For each event, it compares its start time to the end time of the previous event in the sorted list. If there's a conflict (meaning the current event's start time is earlier than the end time of the previous one), it returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it moves on to the next event. It does this for every pair of events and if no conflicts are found by the end, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,352],"elapsed":3.177870464,"_type":"aimessage"}]
