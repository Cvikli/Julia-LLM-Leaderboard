If they both start after one another but finish before the other starts, then they overlap. \n\nThe `event_scheduler` function takes a list of tuples as input, each tuple representing an event's start and end time. It converts these dates to DateTime objects and stores them in a DataFrame. It then checks for overlaps among all pairs of events in the schedule.

Otherwise, if there are no overlapping events, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,449],"elapsed":4.116103856,"_type":"aimessage"}]
