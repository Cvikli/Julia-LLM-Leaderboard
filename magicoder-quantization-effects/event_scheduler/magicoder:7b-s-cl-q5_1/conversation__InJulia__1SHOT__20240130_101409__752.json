If not, it returns \"No events\". It then sorts the event list by start time. \n\nNext, it iterates over every pair of consecutive events in the sorted list. For each pair, it gets the start and finish times for both events and checks whether they overlap. If they do (if the end time of the previous event is after the start time of the current event), it returns \"Conflict\". \n\nIf no conflicts are found after checking all pairs, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,387],"elapsed":3.480618596,"_type":"aimessage"}]
