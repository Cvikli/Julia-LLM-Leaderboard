Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution using the `datetime` library:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\ndef event_scheduler(events):\n    if not events:  # If list is empty\n        return \"No events\"\n        \n    for i in range(len(events)):\n        start = datetime.strptime(events[i][0], \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M\")\n        finish = datetime.strptime(events[i][1], \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M\")\n        \n        for j in range(i+1, len(events)):  # Check only against future events\n            other_start = datetime.strptime(events[j][0], \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M\")\n            other_finish = datetime.strptime(events[j][1], \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M\")\n            \n            # If current event overlaps with another one in terms of time\n            if start < other_finish and finish > other_start: \n                return \"Conflict\"\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"  # No conflict found\n```\nThis function first checks if the list is empty, if so, it returns a message indicating that there are no events. It then loops through each event in the list, parsing its start and finish times using `datetime.strptime` method with the specified format. For each event, it again checks all future events for conflicts by comparing their respective start and finish times. If any conflict is found (i.e., if an event's start time is after the other event's end time), it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of events, it finally returns \"No conflicts\". \n\nThis function assumes that events cannot span across midnight, i.e., their finish times cannot be earlier than their start times. It also assumes that the finish times do not exceed 24 hours from the start time, which is typically the case for a typical event schedule.","status":200,"tokens":[0,450],"elapsed":3.695218922,"_type":"aimessage"}]
