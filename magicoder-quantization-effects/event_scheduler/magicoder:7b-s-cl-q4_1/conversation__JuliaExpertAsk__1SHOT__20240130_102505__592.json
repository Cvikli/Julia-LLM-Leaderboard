Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution that uses Python's built-in `sorted` function to sort the events by their start times and then checks for overlapping events:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef event_scheduler(events):\n    if len(events) == 0:\n        return \"No events\"\n    \n    sorted_events = sorted(events, key=lambda x: datetime.strptime(x[0], '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'))\n    \n    for i in range(1, len(sorted_events)):\n        start_time = datetime.strptime(sorted_events[i][0], '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')\n        end_time = datetime.strptime(sorted_events[i-1][1], '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')\n        \n        if start_time < end_time:\n            return \"Conflict\"\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list is empty and returns \"No events\". Otherwise, it sorts the event tuple by their start times. Then, for each pair of consecutive events in sorted order, it compares the start time and end time of the earlier event with the start time and end time of the later event. If there's an overlap (the earlier event starts when the later one is still ongoing), the function returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, if no overlaps are found, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nRemember to install `python-dateutil` before running the code:\n```shell\npip install python-dateutil\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,358],"elapsed":2.893478469,"_type":"aimessage"}]
