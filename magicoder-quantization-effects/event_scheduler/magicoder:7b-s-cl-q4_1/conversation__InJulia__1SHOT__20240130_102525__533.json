[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

If yes, then there's a scheduling conflict and it returns \"Conflict\".\n- If no conflicts found for all events, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,280],"elapsed":2.266130029,"_type":"aimessage"}]
